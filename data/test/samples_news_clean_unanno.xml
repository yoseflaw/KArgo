      <p>Pelican BioThermal, the global name in temperature controlled packaging, has been recognised as Supply Chain Innovator at the 2018 "Made in Minnesota Manufacturing Awards" by Minnesota Business magazine.</p>
      <p>The award recognises "leaders and the innovation and ingenuity of the state's manufacturing businesses," says the magazine. Award nominees were evaluated by a nine-judge panel of local manufacturing leaders.</p>
      <p>"Minnesota has been a hub of biopharma development for decades, and we have worked hard to match the pace of innovation," says Pelican BioThermal president David Williams. "We are grateful to be recognised for the hard work our team has performed to drive innovation in the transportation of the latest generation of medical treatments and blood products. At nearly 80 drop-points and network stations across the world, our CrÄ“do on demand program is the culmination of years of hard work by our Minnesota engineers and logistics professionals."</p>
      <p>Pelican BioThermal provides the life sciences industry with the most comprehensive suite of patented and award-winning thermal protection packaging solutions for the safe transport of pharmaceuticals, clinical trials, diagnostics, tissue, vaccines and blood supplies. This award comes on the heels of its European office, Peli BioThermal, receiving its second successive Queen's Award for Enterprise, the United Kingdom's most distinguished business award. Additionally, Pelican BioThermal has announced new network locations in Indianapolis, Indiana, Frankfurt, Germany and Sao Paulo, Brazil as well as key hires to further grow its international footprint.</p>

      <p>Boeing won a major freighter order from Turkish Airlines for three 777 Freighters as the flag carrier of Turkey continues to soar on record financial results and double-digit passenger and cargo growth.</p>
      <p>Based on the 777-200LR (Longer Range), the 777 Freighter can fly 4,900 nautical miles (9,070 kilometers) with a full payload of 112 tons (102 metric tonnes or 102,000 kg). The long range means fewer stops and associated landing fees, less congestion at transfer hubs, lower cargo handling costs and shorter delivery times.</p>
      <p>"The additional aircraft will provide us more flexibility to serve even more destinations as we continue to grow our global freight network," said M. Ilker Ayc?, Turkish Airlines chairman of the Board and the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p>The new order comes days after Turkish Airlines posted record profits for the first nine months of 2018 on strong passenger and cargo demand. The carrier's air freight business saw a 25-percent tonnage increase and a 29-percent revenue increase compared to the same period a year ago. The results extend the airline's success in recent years as Turkey has become one of the largest and fastest-growing aviation markets.</p>
      <p>In line with the rapid growth, Turkish Airlines has steadily expanded its current and future fleet. Last January, the carrier announced the order of three 777 Freighters. Two months later, Turkish finalized an order for 25 787-9 Dreamliners and five options to prepare for growing demand at Istanbul's third airport, named "Istanbul Airport" by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an during its official opening last month. Over the past few months, Turkish has begun taking delivery of new 737 MAX airplanes to refresh its single-aisle jets. In all, the airline's fleet of Boeing jetliners has grown to more than 160, with nearly 100 additional jets on order.</p>
      <p>With more than 30 777s in its fleet, Turkish Airlines is among the top 10 operators of the wide-body jet in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, Boeing has launched a strategic partnership programme in Turkey last year, called the National Aerospace Initiative. Aligned with the targets of Turkey's Vision 2023 that set for the 100th anniversary of Turkish Republic's foundation, the initiative lays out a strategic collaboration framework in four key areas: industrial development, technology acceleration, services collaboration and advanced-skill training.</p>
      <p>In line with these goals, Boeing is planning to open an engineering center in Istanbul that would specialize in research and support Turkey's growing aerospace capability. The company also recently expanded its collaboration with Turkish Technic, the maintenance arm of Turkish Airlines. Under the agreement, Turkish Technic becomes a strategic supplier for Boeing's Global Fleet Care programme, providing operators with line maintenance, heavy maintenance, component service and repair for multiple aircraft models. Additionally, Boeing and Turkish Technic will partner to train and certify aircraft technicians.</p>

    <title>Amazon feels a $350,000 burning sensation</title>

      <p>Who'd have thought a product called "Amazing Liquid Fire" could be dangerous air cargo? Apparently, not Amazon.</p>
      <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) didn't think carrying the product, sold as a drain cleaner, was such a hot idea and is looking to slap Amazon with a US$350,000 fine for allegedly shipping prohibited and dangerous goods by air. The proposed fine stems from a 2014 spill of the caustic product, which sent nine UPS employees to the chemical wash after they felt a burning sensation.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time that shippers have been burned for moving prohibited cargo. In 2015, the FAA levied more than $4.5 million in penalties for improper shipments of hazardous air cargo, an increase from $3.4 million in 2014, according to the Dallas Morning News.</p>
      <p>Amazon is feeling the heat, and working with the FAA on the issue, the Seattle-based online retailer said in an e-mailed statement. "We ship tens of millions of products every day and have developed sophisticated technologies to detect potential shipping hazards and use any defects as an opportunity for continuous improvement," the company said. And with an estimated 3.3 million packages a day, 24 documented violations per year jives with the company's defense.</p>

      <p>Swiss WorldCargo, Cargologic and SATS have established a secure temperature-controlled, quality corridor between Singapore and Zurich, the consortium announced earlier this week. The three cargo-handling companies have synchronized their Singapore-Zurich facilities and procedures to deliver accurate, reliable shipments along all steps of the airfreight chain.</p>
      <p>The collaboration, according to a representative, will facilitate paperless cargo acceptance processes and make more information available to be shared with shippers.</p>
      <p>This formalization of best practices along an entire transport chain reflects a trend in air cargo to accommodate the standards required by the pharmaceutical industry. While airlines began making the requisite improvements years ago, the highest levels of certification, temperature integrity and tracking are extending outwards to other nodes of the supply chain, including forwarders, ground handlers and trucking companies.</p>
      <p>Switzerland-based Cargologic and Singapore-based SATS are certified as part of IATA's Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) in pharmaceutical handling. Both companies are compliant under Good Distribution Practices (GDP) regulations and employ trained cold-chain handling specialists.</p>
