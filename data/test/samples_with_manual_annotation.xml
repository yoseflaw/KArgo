      <p>[[Brussels Airlines Cargo]] has switched its [[GSSA]] from [[European Cargo Services]] ([[ECS]]) to [[Air Logistics Group]] for [[belly-hold space]] on its passenger services.
The carrier said the decision to break with its representative of 13 years was part of “an ambitious strategic plan to further grow its cargo business.”
It said it marked “a new era in which [[Brussels Airlines]] wishes to get even closer to the customer” in its freight activities.
Cargo has become an increasingly important activity for the Belgian carrier, with over 41,000 tonnes transported on its routes, which major on Africa but also include the US and the rest of Europe.
[[Freight volumes]] have grown by double digits over the last five – and by 34% on North Atlantic routes and 8% in revenue terms on African routes.
[[Brussels Airlines]] vice president sales Africa and cargo, Philippe Saeys-Desmedt explained: “[[Brussels Airlines Cargo]] is more than ever a strategic revenue contributor of our business and we foresee a further growth of our [[tonnage]] by 6 percent in 2016.”
[[ALG]] will represent [[Brussels Airlines Cargo]] worldwide from September 1 except for Africa, where the carrier will continue to represent itself.
The carrier already offers a ‘[[Fresh-to-shelf]]’ service for [[perishable goods]] from Africa and to launch new products to serve other market segments in the next few months.
Saeys-Desmedt added: “This cooperation will allow us to continue to raise [[Brussels Airlines Cargo]]’s unique cargo brand to our customers, thanks to a dedicated sales team in Brussels and a vast worldwide network of agencies.”
[[ALG]]’s chief operating officer Stephen Dawkins said: “Together we are very complementary, as we have extensive experience in the Asian and US markets, while [[Brussels Airlines]] is the Africa expert, with their unique and comprehensive network of destinations on the continent.
"We will work together very closely to meet their customer’s high expectations, so as [[Brussels Airlines Cargo]] can build an even stronger market position.”</p>

      <p>[[Qatar Airways Group]] chief executive Akbar Al Baker hinted that his airline could place orders for further [[747-8 freighter aircraft]] from [[Boeing]], at a handover for the first of the aircraft at the plane-maker’s Seattle base on 25 September.
He told a press conference that the carrier had “already sold” the capacity on the first two planes. A second [[747-F]] is due to join the Qatar fleet in November.
He told the press conference that [[Qatar Airways]] was currently experiencing a [[cargo boom]] following the [[blockade]] imposed by neighbouring countries over the country’s alleged support for [[Middle East]] terrorist groups. [[Tonnage]] was currently up 160% compared with the same time last year, said Al Bakar.
He was also confident that the carrier would continue to find a use for additional [[freighter capacity]] at such time as the [[blockade]] ended, for example by serving additional markets or moving cargo from [[bellyhold]] to [[freighter aircraft]].
At the conference, he also confirmed an order for an additional four [[777-300]] [[passenger aircraft]], bringing the carrier’s total order book with [[Boeing]] to $2.2bn.</p>
