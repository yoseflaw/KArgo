      <p>[[Ethiopian Airlines]] is improving the quality of its [[climate-controlled services]] through the use of [[DoKaSch]] [[Temperature Solutions]]’ [[Opticooler container]].</p>
      <p>The [[Opticooler]] is equipped with [[battery powered cooling compressors]] and [[heaters]] as well as a [[self regulating temperature control]], so that [[temperature sensitive goods]], in particular pharmaceuticals such as insulin and vaccines, stay within range at any point in the [[storage area]].</p>
      <p>The airline has also signed a master agreement with the German [[ULD provider]] and has also opened the largest [[cargo terminal]] in Africa at its hub in Addis Ababa.</p>
      <p>The Addis Ababa hub focuses on handling [[temperature sensitive goods]], and since February, [[Ethiopian Airlines]] has offered the [[DoKaSch]] [[active container]] to fly goods through the hub.</p>
      <p>[[Ethiopian Cargo]] &amp; [[Logistics Services]] managing director, Fitsum Abady says: “We are very glad to offer our customers a highly reliable packaging solution to transport
[[temperature-sensitive shipments]] with [[DoKaSch’s Opticooler]].</p>
      <p>“In this fast growing and strongly competitive market, it is important that we offer our customers the best packaging solution for their [[sensitive cargo]].”</p>
      <p>[[DoKaSch]] [[Temperature Solutions]] managing director, Andreas Seitz says: “[[Ethiopian
Airlines]] is the most successful African carrier and their hub in Addis Ababa develops very positive regarding the cargo handlings. Therefore, we are very pleased, that we could expand our African network by signing the master agreement with [[Ethiopian Airlines]].”</p>

      <p>[[Brussels Airlines Cargo]] has switched its [[GSSA]] from [[European Cargo Services]] ([[ECS]]) to [[Air Logistics Group]] for [[belly-hold space]] on its passenger services.
The carrier said the decision to break with its representative of 13 years was part of “an ambitious strategic plan to further grow its cargo business.”
It said it marked “a new era in which [[Brussels Airlines]] wishes to get even closer to the customer” in its freight activities.
Cargo has become an increasingly important activity for the Belgian carrier, with over 41,000 tonnes transported on its routes, which major on Africa but also include the US and the rest of Europe.
[[Freight volumes]] have grown by double digits over the last five – and by 34% on North Atlantic routes and 8% in revenue terms on African routes.
[[Brussels Airlines]] vice president sales Africa and cargo, Philippe Saeys-Desmedt explained: “[[Brussels Airlines Cargo]] is more than ever a strategic revenue contributor of our business and we foresee a further growth of our [[tonnage]] by 6 percent in 2016.”
[[ALG]] will represent [[Brussels Airlines Cargo]] worldwide from September 1 except for Africa, where the carrier will continue to represent itself.
The carrier already offers a ‘[[Fresh-to-shelf]]’ service for [[perishable goods]] from Africa and to launch new products to serve other market segments in the next few months.
Saeys-Desmedt added: “This cooperation will allow us to continue to raise [[Brussels Airlines Cargo]]’s unique cargo brand to our customers, thanks to a dedicated sales team in Brussels and a vast worldwide network of agencies.”
[[ALG]]’s chief operating officer Stephen Dawkins said: “Together we are very complementary, as we have extensive experience in the Asian and US markets, while [[Brussels Airlines]] is the Africa expert, with their unique and comprehensive network of destinations on the continent.
"We will work together very closely to meet their customer’s high expectations, so as [[Brussels Airlines Cargo]] can build an even stronger market position.”</p>

      <p>[[Qatar Airways Group]] chief executive Akbar Al Baker hinted that his airline could place orders for further [[747-8 freighter aircraft]] from [[Boeing]], at a handover for the first of the aircraft at the plane-maker’s Seattle base on 25 September.
He told a press conference that the carrier had “already sold” the capacity on the first two planes. A second [[747-F]] is due to join the Qatar fleet in November.
He told the press conference that [[Qatar Airways]] was currently experiencing a [[cargo boom]] following the [[blockade]] imposed by neighbouring countries over the country’s alleged support for [[Middle East]] terrorist groups. [[Tonnage]] was currently up 160% compared with the same time last year, said Al Bakar.
He was also confident that the carrier would continue to find a use for additional [[freighter capacity]] at such time as the [[blockade]] ended, for example by serving additional markets or moving cargo from [[bellyhold]] to [[freighter aircraft]].
At the conference, he also confirmed an order for an additional four [[777-300]] [[passenger aircraft]], bringing the carrier’s total order book with [[Boeing]] to $2.2bn.</p>

    <title>[[Maersk]] pledges to 'welcome' forwarders onto [[TradeLens]] digital platform</title>

      <p>[[Maersk]] has responded to a call by forwarders to share efforts to standardise digitisation through its TradeLens platform, saying it is “cultivating diverse membership” and welcomes all-comers.</p>
      <p>This month, former [[DSV]] executive Steve Walker warned that the [[forwarding industry]] was at risk of losing out as [[shipping lines]] look to take control of data.</p>
      <p>“[[Maersk]] announced it wants half its earnings to come from [[inland logistics]]; a bold statement without reassuring words for their customer base of forwarders,” wrote Mr Walker.</p>
      <p>“I feel that the [[container shipping lines]]’ threat of removing the forwarder and gaining greater direct [[FCL]] market share, is in fact growing.</p>
      <p>“And the threat is not about vessels, containers, rates, [[rebates]] or [[landside equipment]], it is now driven by the one thing forwarders must keep control of – data.”</p>
      <p>Pointing to [[Maersk]]’s [[TradeLens blockchain initiative]], he added: “Here is a concerted effort, with multiple lines under the [[Maersk/IBM]] joint venture banner, offering a secure controlled end-to-end solution where documents are no longer exchanged physically or digitally, but instead, the relevant data is shared and distributed using [[blockchain technology]] under single ownership principles determined by the type of information.</p>
      <p>“These very lines, who have been unable to give us any data, by phone or online are capable of leaping decades to seek control of a potential industry standard data flow mechanism.”</p>
      <p>He asked if [[Maersk]] would allow [[Fiata]] to sit on an independent management board, “now that the carriers want to become one of us”, adding: “Therefore all data would reside under the control of an independent entity.”</p>
      <p>[[Maersk]] issued a statement to The Loadstar in response, which, while not directly addressing that point, said it welcomed forwarders on to its platform.</p>
      <p>“We are committed to embracing international standards and working with the bodies and organisations that help to drive digitisation broadly, such as the [[Digital Container Shipping Association]] ([[DCSA]]) and the [[United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation]] and [[Electronic Business]] ([[UN/CEFACT]]).</p>
      <p>“We are also committed to cultivating diverse membership on the [[TradeLens]] advisory board to ensure [[TradeLens]] works for all.</p>
      <p>“[[TradeLens]] is an open and neutral platform which brings together hundreds, and ultimately thousands, of separate trading partners with the common approach to sharing information and documents securely and quickly, as well as to connect and simplify customers’ supply chains.</p>
      <p>“Freight forwarders have always been forerunners when it comes to adapting new technologies that drive innovation and increase efficiency. They provide valuable services, and [[TradeLens]] helps to facilitate these activities in the global shipping network. Freight forwarders and 3PL providers, like Agility, Livingston, WWA and Kerry Logistics, are already working with the platform.”</p>
      <p>However, there are industry concerns that [[TradeLens]] could fall foul of antitrust authorities, and may need to work harder at member diversification and openness.</p>
      <p>[[JOC]] noted last week that with five of the six biggest lines on board, “eventually, it’s likely that antitrust authorities will view these sorts of private blockchain consortia as no different from the cartels they are currently cracking down on”.</p>
      <p>Private platforms such as [[TradeLens]] could be “viewed as providing advantageous [[trading access]]. This could run the risk of being seen to unfairly exclude competitors”, according to one law firm.</p>
      <p>Eight forwarders or groups have now joined [[TradeLens]], along with some 18 [[shipping lines]], 28 ports and terminals, and 10 [[inland transport]] companies.</p>
      <p>Mr Walker also suggested that another potential way forward would be for [[Fiata]] to become involved with [[Kuehne + Nagel]]’s [[Accenture]] platform.</p>
      <p>“I hear instantly the negative response,” he wrote, “but if the lines can collaborate, in this fast-changing world, could we the forwarding community at least consider this? We do not have time to lose; we need a partner on this journey already.”</p>
      <p>However, a [[K+N]] spokesperson told The Loadstar: “[[Kuehne + Nagel]] does not wish to comment.”</p>
      <p>[[Fiata]] told The Loadstar last week it was broadly in agreement with Mr Walker and would meet him next month to discuss a way forward.</p>
