      <p>UK Midlands-based global logistics, warehousing and transport business Amco Services International has appointed Mark Jones to the newly created role of operations director following significant business growth.</p>
      <p>The appointment sees Jones, who joined Amco in 2016 as head of operations, taking responsibility across the group for Amco’s UK and Eastern European transport and vehicle fleet, driver compliance and Health and Safety. He will manage the group’s warehouse operations, IT and systems with the continuing development of Warehouse And Transport Management Systems as a key focus. Quality Management Systems will also fall under Jones’ span of control.</p>
      <p>Don Mucci, Amco’s managing director, says that creating this new role was a logical step. “Pivotal to our success and continued growth is our unwavering focus on our operational functions, systems fleet and warehousing infrastructure. Mark and his team are also key in making sure our customers receive the highest level of service and management attention.”</p>
      <p>After impressive 53% growth over the past three years, Amco is positioned for a strong 2020 across their our UK sites. They will continue to invest in IT and capital investments in the UK but also invest into their fleet in Eastern Europe.</p>

      <p>Aeroflot has temporarily suspended its flight schedule for Italy, France, Germany and Spain, from Moscow between March 13 and April 30 in an effort to restrict the spread of COVID-19.</p>
      <p>Locations affected will include, Alicante, Valencia, Malaga, Palma, Maseille, Lyon, Nice, Dresden, Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Hannover, Stuttgart, Milan, Venice, Napoli, Verona and Bologna. Roysia flights under commercial management of Aeroflot will also temporarily suspend flights to Nice, Dusseldorf and Hamburg within the same time frame.</p>
      <p>Due to a high number of Russian citizens currently in Tenerife, flights will continue to operate from March 13 – 20 on charter basis solely to return passengers to their original point of departure.</p>
      <p>The effected routes will therefore have limited cargo exchange as belly cargo is drastically reduced as a result of the suspension.</p>

      <p>Following President Trump’s announcement of strict travel restrictions for 30 days, from Europe to the US, in a bid to combat the spread of the coronavirus, PML – the global perishable cargo specialists – advises a solution is available to overcome this dramatic turn of events.</p>
      <p>The new rules, which go into effect on Friday 13th, at midnight, are directed at the 26 European states in the Schengen area but does not include the UK or Ireland.</p>
      <p>Nick Finbow, sales director at PML commented, “We recognise the major concerns this will cause for so many of our clients but for us it is very much business as usual. European companies, or companies with a European base that are looking to send their goods to the US can forward their cargo to the UK and we will seamlessly send the consignment onto the US.</p>
      <p>“Similarly, if a cargo is scheduled to return from the US back into Europe, we can receive the goods into the UK, undertake all the necessary customs clearance checks and deliver to the desired European destination. The restriction applies to people, not goods and with our established expertise in transferring cargo, we have the capacity to enable the continued transportation of goods to and from the US.”</p>

      <p>Jettainer received has received ‘best service’ award for the second time at the Oman Air Cargo awards at the award gala on March 4 in Muscat, Oman.</p>
      <p>“We are very pleased that we were able to convince with our work again. Receiving the award for the second time in a row underlines our excellent relationship with Oman Air Cargo,” comments Thomas Sonntag, CEO of Jettainer GmbH.</p>
      <p>Oman Air outsourced the ULD management to Jettainer in October 2017. The market leader has a dedicated team in Abu Dhabi and Muscat, which manages just under 20.000 standard and special ULDs for international airlines in the Middle Eastern region. In 2019, Jettainer has increased Oman Air’s ULD fleet by about 20% to support their future growth strategy. Jettainer’s regional office also operates the order management of temperature-controlled containers, which requires a high level of expertise as these are managed differently from standard ULDs.</p>
      <p>“We thank our co-operators for the outstanding work in 2019. With Jettainer, we can count on a reliable partner for over two years already and we are looking forward to a fruitful long-term cooperation,” commented Mohammed Al Musafir, SVP at Oman Air Cargo.</p>
