      <p>Lufthansa Cargo AG selects IBS Software’s industry-first ‘zero outage’ SaaS solution to host and maintain its iCAP cargo handling application platform.</p>
      <p>IBS Software has signed a five-year contract with Lufthansa Cargo to take full ownership of Lufthansa Cargo’s iCAP cargo handling application platform, which is powered by IBS Software’s iCargo cargo management platform.</p>
      <p>With zero outage capability, planned maintenance is completed with absolutely no outage to the business IT system – one of the major benefits for Lufthansa Cargo. This unique capability results in operational stability, which is essential to fulfil the customer promise and to provide effective and seamless cargo handling operations around the clock across all time zones without any service disruptions.</p>
      <p>Initial performance of the system, which operates from IBS Software’s new data centre in Frankfurt, has shown that the SaaS service has exceeded the benchmarks in all parameters set by Lufthansa Cargo, with 100% SLA compliance.</p>
      <p>“IBS Software has consistently delivered beyond expectations throughout our relationship that started with the iCAP implementation. They have demonstrated their capability to take on the established leaders in application hosting and offer a true SaaS provisioning that helps us to focus on our core competencies. We greatly value the responsibility and commitment that IBS Software brings to the table,” commented Dr Jochen Göttelmann, CIO at Lufthansa Cargo.</p>

      <p>Enterprise solutions company Tigers is working with shipping and distribution specialist Asendia to provide a postal solution for the European B2C market.</p>
      <p>Tigers is set to enhance its abilities within the European B2C market, particularly for customers with low-value orders, by adding a competitive postal solution for small-sized and low-weight orders as a new and additional offering.</p>
      <p>Through the expanded agreement, Berne-headquartered Asendia’s standard goods and fully tracked goods services – Asendia’s track and trace solutions – will be utilised by Tigers to meet and exceed customer requirements across Europe with new postal opportunities.</p>
      <p>“Through our co-operation with Asendia we are now able to provide an additional layer of service to our customers’ ever-evolving e-commerce requirements,” said Shahar Ayash, regional managing director Tigers, Europe.</p>
      <p>“In Rotterdam we serve a number of brands as a regional and global hub and the Postal Solution fits their strategy to reach everywhere in an economic way without the need to open new hubs and the associated implications.</p>
      <p>“The courier companies will continue to play an important role of course, however services like our postal solution for low value products are being increasingly requested.”</p>
      <p>Lennart Otte, sales manager Tigers Netherlands, added: “We have seen a growing number of new customers moving towards this postal solution and I believe that it will continue to create interest in the market.</p>
      <p>“The postal service has improved a lot in the last few years in order to meet the new demands and we are looking to expand this to additional hubs we have in the region soon.”</p>
      <p>The growing collaboration strengthens the existing relationship between Tigers and Asendia that has seen Tigers’ extensive warehousing network across Australia being used as the local logistics partner for Asendia’s new Oceania e-commerce and mail solutions subsidiary.</p>

      <p>A recent report has suggested that the global e-commerce logistics market is likely to exceed $570 billion by 2024. Simon Wong, CEO of the U-Freight Group, has released a statement reinforcing the fact that his company is ready to meet the ever-increasing challenges of providing logistics services to this rapidly expanding sector of global trade.</p>
      <p>“Transport intelligence, a major provider of market research solutions to the global logistics industry, says e-commerce is quite a puzzle for logistics service providers,” writes Wong.</p>
      <p>“The “exponential growth” of e-commerce and the increased role of consumers in individual transactions pose several challenges to governments and businesses alike, whether in terms of trade facilitation, safety/security or the collection of duties and taxes.</p>
      <p>“At U-Freight, in our development of e-commerce logistics solutions, we are continually trying to address the key issues stemming from increasing volumes of business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce shipments and the time sensitivity thereof.</p>
      <p>“Examples of those efforts include investment in several of the company’s warehouse facilities to enable them to act as e-commerce fulfilment centres. We are a logistics partner of choice for the growing number of online channels and platforms which entrepreneurs are using to sell their own designs and products, including global eCommerce shipping platforms such as Easyship, and are heavily involved in the Fulfilment by Amazon programme in several countries.</p>
      <p>“In 2019, we launched e+Solutions, a new product to assist small businesses with their e-commerce logistics needs. We have also been qualified by China Customs and CIQ (China Inspection and Quarantine) as a licensed Cross-border E-Commerce Enterprise and as a Cross-Border E-Commerce Logistics Service Provider.</p>
      <p>“All of these initiatives are helping us boost efficiency and capture more value, in order to capitalise on the opportunities that e-commerce is presenting.”</p>

      <p>The British International Freight Association’s (BIFA) Young Forwarders Network (YFN) is celebrating one year of operation.</p>
      <p>The YFN was launched in March 2019 to create several regional networking groups, run by young forwarders and designed to help early talent and young BIFA members develop their knowledge and professional skills, but in a more social environment.</p>
      <p>One year on, six regional networks have already been established with more in the pipeline, and more than 20 networking events have been held, with many more scheduled for the remainder of the year.</p>
      <p>“Each event the YFN attend – whether that is a tour or a talk from an industry professional – they return to the workplace with more knowledge. When the YFN was launched, we said we thought it would prove to be a major step forward for the industry in developing its future freight forwarding ambassadors and leaders. The young people who are joining the various regional groups are improving their knowledge of the sector, trends within it, as well as building their skill sets and learning from others,” Carl Hobbis, BIFA’s training development manager has said.</p>
      <p>The next Heathrow networking event with take place in Staines on March 24, 2020, will focus on technology in the supply chain, with attendees receiving a presentation from Waldo Remijn, director process &amp; technology excellence at OIA Global.</p>

      <p>TIACA will deliver the latest market and route analyses to its members after signing an intelligence sharing agreement with CLIVE Data services, creators of the new ‘dynamic load factor’ analyses.</p>
      <p>“As part of the transformation of TIACA, we are promising to deliver more content to our growing membership – but only content of value to their businesses and which accurately represents and promotes the global air cargo industry. CLIVE’s dynamic load factor is registering a lot of interest because it breaks with tradition and is changing the way air cargo usage is measured based on the realities of today’s market. It is also the fastest source of data, which is also very appealing for our members,” says Steven Polmans, Chairman of TIACA.</p>
      <p>A recent TIACA survey showed that its members are looking to the Association to educate the industry on air cargo economics and provide more market-based data and analysis. Under the terms of the agreement, CLIVE will provide market data for TIACA’s Cargo Pulse newsletter as well as regular market trends content for social media and speakers at the Association’s conferences on market and route trends</p>
      <p>“Working with TIACA enables us to put our market intelligence in front of a large group of respected decision-makers, who we hope will embrace our new load factor methodology. This represents another important step forward in getting the industry to accept there is a new and more accurate way to measure how full flights are,” commented Niall van de Wouw.</p>
