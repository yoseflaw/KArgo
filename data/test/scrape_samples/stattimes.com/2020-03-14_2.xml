      <p>What’s your reaction to winning this award?I am very surprised and terribly honoured for this. Honoured, because I have put in so many years into cargo business and I love the cargo business.  So, to be recognised by STAT Times is truly a privilege. But once again, I wouldn’t receive this if I didn’t have a team of great people around me to provide me the environment to flourish. So it is really not about me; it is about the whole team, particularly Air Canada Cargo.</p>
      <p>Can you pick some key highlights of your career that spans four decades?I really fell into the airlines industry by happenstance. I was a university student and I was looking for a part time summer job. I got a job in the airline industry and I never left because, they talked about having the bug, and I had the big very seriously. I was very fortunate to have the experience in the passenger as well as the cargo departments. I must say my career is split half. But it is really the last latter part of my career that was in cargo. I found it to be a challenging environment. It is always changing; there has never been one day the same as the next. For me, cargo was wonderful. I had the opportunity to work for two airlines in my career. I was with Air France where I did passenger and cargo and latter half of my career was with Air Canada working both in passenger and cargo divisions. So they were both tremendous schools and I had the privilege of working overseas so getting to know different cultures and understanding different markets and how people react. This was really helpful to me. And in cargo I also had the privilege of working the operations, which was probably one of the best things to have happened to me. Because it allowed me to learn really about what cargo is all about. Not just the commercial part,  but how do things move; what you need to do to enable the movement of goods, depending on what types of product you are moving, etc. That was a turning point for me. So moves can be lateral but being lateral you gain breadth and that is the opportunity I had by being able to go from sales to cargo operations. From there eventually I took on more senior roles to finally become the vice president of cargo at Air Canada. So I had a good understanding of the commercial part of the business but also a very in-depth understanding of the operations. I think the two together really enabled to make hopefully good decisions.</p>
      <p>How connected are you with the air cargo industry now?I haven’t disconnected completely because I do watch things at a distance. It is interesting. I don’t have my hand on the pulse. I am at a distance. But I do look at it because I am interested in world economy and world trade; so automatically I am interested in what’s happening in the cargo world.</p>
      <p>What keeps you busy now in the retired life?I think certainly travel and reconnecting with family and friends which has been wonderful. I now have more time to be, what I call ‘a little bit more civilised, little bit more patient and tolerant and what not’ because I think when you are so tied up in your work sometimes you lose sight of things that you should be doing. So I am trying to reconnect to that. One of the areas that interest me at the end of my career was helping women. Not just women in Canada or that I was in contact with but also women in the world at large. What can we do to make sure that women who are from underprivileged areas rise and make a difference. So I became involved in helping out an organisation in Canada that looks at raising funds to provide higher education for women in Sub Sahara Africa. A lot of women that we helped are women who come from very poor environment. We have identified women who are bright and have the desire to break through the poverty cycle and to invest time in studying and become leaders of their families or their communities.</p>
      <p>You are someone who held very senior leadership positions in industry organisations. What are your thoughts on attracting new talent into air cargo industry and gender diversity?Unfortunately, air cargo industry is not very well known by the public. We don’t deal with the end consumer, we deal with middle men. And so we are invisible unlike the passenger world. What we do is almost hidden. And I guess that is the biggest challenge. We do need to tap into more talent. The industry needs bright minds who have solutions, who are going to find ways to help us keep this industry progressing at a faster pace. One of my frustrations with the industry is that it is so slow to move. There are reasons for that. In an airline you (cargo) are sort of at the low end of the pecking order, sometimes for getting capital and make investments. Having said that, the industry needs to find a way to tap into talent and that talent should not to be restricted to only one gender. The more we have the better we will succeed in attracting that talent. I think with the universities we had started looking at that. Going out to educational institutions to try and highlight what this industry is about. It is fascinating when you think about it. We have our finger on the pulse of world trade, you know, if you look at what’s going in the world right now, people are going to start feeling the repercussions of what’s going on with this coronavirus. The current crisis will impact air cargo and disrupt the flow of goods in general and eventually will impact the consumers. So this is the time when that would become more evident. Therefore, we need to have people who have solutions to find alternatives on what do we do in such instances? So, it is important to have the word out on all the fascinating jobs that are available in cargo. You know there is sales, commercial, marketing, finance, operations, it is so vast. It is an airline within an airline. It has all the opportunity to attract anyone and I think women are absolutely capable and apt in if they would be interested in it.</p>
      <p>What’s your advice to air cargo professional and those wanting to join the industry?That is a tall question. But I guess the more we talk about the industry the more we build awareness. We take both men and women in the industry to go out and try and attract talent into the industry. And once again it shouldn’t be difficult in that we have so many fascinating areas of the business in which one could be involved. Someone may have an IT background, and guess what; there is a lot of IT going on in cargo. It could be in finance, sales or marketing. I think, the wonderful part about the cargo industry, which I really enjoy, was that it is really a small industry, relative to the airline industry. You will get to know everybody. That is fun too. You build relationships and you are able to not only work at something you love but also with people that you enjoy and with whom you can connect.</p>

      <p>By safely bringing the air cargo community together in the midst of the unfortunate coronavirus outbreak, Air Cargo India 2020 successfully set a platform for the industry to gauge the prevailing crises and discuss on resilient programs and services that could alleviate the impacts of current situation and other challenges being faced by the air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>Vandana Aggarwal, economic adviser to the Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation, opened the gates to the exhibition hall and inaugurated the 8th edition of the Air Cargo India event, which took place at the Grand Hyatt Hotel Mumbai, India from 25 to 27 February. Gerhard Gerritzen, deputy managing director of Messe Muenchen, underscored his optimism in the welcome note by declaring that the “Air cargo in India has a lot of potential.” R K Patra, group editor-in-chief of STAT Media Group, lauded the spirit of the cargo community which had gathered for the 3-day event despite the circumstances encircling the coronavirus epidemic.</p>
      <p>Aggarwal, in her keynote address, informed the air cargo community about India’s current position with respect to exports and imports tonnage, and pointed out the existing discrepancies between Indian and global supply chain.</p>
      <p>Aggarwal stressed on the government’s interest to encourage the development of digital infrastructure around trades and highlighted a special case of digital corridor between Mumbai airport, India and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by urging the parties involved to put the corridor in operation during the current fiscal year. She also invited airports from Singapore and Germany by announcing that “We are ready to partner to create digital airport corridor.”</p>
      <p>While highlighting the needed digital infrastructural initiatives to increase the Indian air cargo capacity, Aggarwal pointed out the drag of nascent Indian maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) industry on the air cargo capacity. She complained that “India’s air cargo has not taken off because inventory required to carry out the expensive MRO is being done out of India.” India is one of the youngest countries and has one of the largest pools of engineers. Aggarwal, entrusting the new business, assured that “MRO can be 30 percent cheaper in India compared to other countries.”</p>
      <p>India is clearly a growing market and stands second when it comes to exports of fruits, vegetables, dairy products. Focusing her attention on agri logistics through air, Aggarwal talked about government policies that are focused on agri logistics through air, like ‘Krishi Udan Yojana’, a scheme which aims to facilitate transportation of agricultural goods through air, and said that the “Demand is there and supply is there but somewhere the logistics is failing.” She added, “Logistics needs to catch up.”</p>
      <p>Air Cargo India 2020 saw participation of more than 65 panel members for its conference sessions, contributing insights on various topics across various panel discussions. Each panel discussion had a blend of dynamic panel members that not only discussed their company trends but also provided insights on services that could be made better across the supply chain.</p>
      <p>Digitalisation making the chain transparentPanel discussion on the subject of the ‘State of digitalistion in the air cargo industry’ underscored the importance of transparency through digitalising operations across value chain. Stories on how the implementations of key performance indicators (KPIs), electronic data interchange (EDI) and paperless exchange of information between all the stockholders in the chain are endowing customers with the desired transparency, making the processes more sustainable and bringing more trust into the business. With investments accelerating the development of sophisticated digital infrastructure, services are getting standardised, allowing the industry to process huge amounts of data for inspection and making the process more economic.</p>
      <p>Perishable goods need more attentionOn the subject of ‘setting standards and building capacity for transport and logistics of perishable goods’, the panel put forth key challenges faced during the transportation of perishable goods—from harvesting and sorting of goods to packaging and handling of shipments. The panel raised concerns of India perishable goods not keeping with the global standards and highlighted concerns pertaining to specialised requirements of the product for packaging and sorting. Taking points from keynote presented by Aggarwal, the panel members shared their practical insights on the trade modifications being implemented due to the new Krishi Udan Yojana. The exports of Indian perishable goods are thriving to grow and, for now, this expected growth is certainly pushing the industry to focus more on sophisticated utilisation of existing resources.</p>
      <p>Co-creating pharma supply chainAir freight industry has come together like never before to uplift the exports of pharmaceutical products. India is one of the key exporters of temperature sensitive products and the pharma market’s momentum is forcing the industry to rapidly accommodate its esoteric shipment requirements. The panel discussion, which involved members from airlines, airports, pharmaceutical corporations, cargo handling companies and equipment and instrument manufacturers, emphasised on the collaborative efforts needed for the cold chain to remain intact throughout the supply chain. The role of data in obtaining full transparency of the shipment was discussed and technologies like blockchain, AI were seen as the tool to achieve the much needed transparency.</p>
      <p>Air cargo for ecommerce logistics— enabling and delivering global tradeAir cargo volume for ecommerce has consistently seen double-digit growth and considering the current market, it aspires to sustain the current growth trajectory. Without boxing the ecommerce sector to operations of giants like Amazon, Shopify etc., the panel members acknowledged the broadly categorised sector and spoke about regulatory and warehousing requirements, cross border shipment challenges, digital regulation and cutting edge technologies that are coming to fore. Digital regulation stirred the panel into discussing the regulations surrounding single window clearance. With China having already implemented single window clearance, also called as free trade zone, at around 15 areas within the country, it may serve Indian regulatory bodies as a good case to study and equip them with new ways to nudge the ecommerce sector to a pace that is truly global. The panel members made a point that such free trade zones in India will dramatically reduce regulatory footprint off of many products that sellers are reluctant on dealing with. Cross border challenge concerning imports was one of the important highlights of the discussion along with issues pertaining to licensing and clearances. The members concluded the panel by effectively pointing out the needed reforms at the airports and customs agencies.</p>
      <p>Discussions on subjects like trade tension drag on air cargo and building resilience; India as promising air cargo export region; airports of the future for special cargo commodities; and transportation support for the digital comprehensively voiced the impacts of coronavirus on trade and ensuing exports and imports modulations being made due to trade regulations adjustments. Making note of the grim situation, panel members, fashioning new ideas and collaborations, discussed the current circumstances with a spirit of optimism across the supply chain.</p>
      <p>The Air Cargo India 2020 show housed 74 exhibitors and attracted more than 2000 visitors, making the exhibition hall a hotspot for networking. The arrays of booths put up at the exhibition area were both creative in their architecture and unique in offerings. Some booths had traditional delights from their respective countries; others had devices, instruments, containers etc. installed in booths for demonstrations. The exhibition area, as a tradition at the Air Cargo India event, served exhibitors as a platform for meeting partners, collaborators and future clients.</p>

      <p>Luxembourg Airport has engaged Nallian, a specialist of collaborative solutions in logistics and air cargo based in Belgium, to implement a cargo community system (CCS) at the airport.</p>
      <p>The CCS represents an important component of the Luxembourg Single Window for Logistics program and will be set up as a neutral IT platform, open to all actors involved in international trade. Enabling real-time capturing and sharing of granular information regarding shipment processing, far beyond the traditional cargo data, it will empower all stakeholders involved to better plan and execute their processes and will drive efficiency and visibility with in-depth insights in performance.</p>
      <p>In a first implementation phase in 2020, the application shall prove its operability and added value for the cargo community. Upon the successful run of perishables and live animals shipments with a limited number of involved actors, namely Cargolux, LuxairCargo, Kuehne+Nagel, Arthur Welter and the public administrations concerned, the CCS shall be rolled out to all types of cargo and all companies that are interested to join.</p>
      <p>René Steinhaus, CEO of lux-Airport said, “lux-Airport is excited to implement, together with its cargo community, a data sharing platform. With this decision lux-Airport demonstrates its commitment to support the airport cargo community and to foster the competitiveness and further growth of Luxembourg as a European multimodal logistics hub. Nallian has been selected because their solution demonstrates their core competence in cargo communities, using best practice processes frameworks, and enables for integration with other cargo communities.”</p>
      <p>Jean Verheyen, CEO of Nallian said, “We are proud to have been selected by lux-Airport, with whom we share a common vision on the importance and power of digitization and data sharing for air cargo. We are excited to help them realize their ambition to further develop the competitiveness of the airport and the logistics sector in Luxembourg as a whole.”</p>

      <p>On the occasion of International Women’s Day, Dubai-based airline Emirates released a video that follows an all-women flight deck crew operate multi-stop cargo flights across four continents on Emirates SkyCargo’s Boeing 777 freighter aircraft.</p>
      <p>Captain Ellen Roz from the United States and First Officer Heidi McDiarmid from Australia cover close to 30,000kms in 10 days on five freighter flights from Frankfurt to Mexico City onwards to Quito, Aguadilla, Amsterdam and finally to Dubai transporting over 300 tonnes of cargo ranging from fresh flowers and fruits to pharmaceuticals. The two pilots were also joined by Captain Heather Wolf from Canada for operating the flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Women in EmiratesWomen constitute more than 40 percent of the total workforce at Emirates with the majority working as cabin crew. Emirates’ female pilots come from over 30 nationalities, covering an age range from 23 to 62 years. Women from over 160 nationalities, including more than 1,100 Emiratis, are employed across the Emirates Group in operational roles in functions including flight operations, engineering, aircraft maintenance and appearance, catering, cargo and ramp operations; in customer facing roles in airport services, sales and customer affairs and corporate roles across business support functions.</p>
      <p>“From the very start, Emirates’ success story has been powered to a large extent thanks to the hard work and talent of our female employees across all our business functions. On the occasion of International Women’s Day we celebrate their immense achievement not just at Emirates but within the global aviation industry. We are happy and proud that our multinational women employees act as trail blazers in connecting the world and also as role models encouraging women and girls everywhere to pursue careers in aviation,” said Abdulaziz Al Ali, executive vice president of Human Resources at Emirates Group.</p>
      <p>Freighter OperationsUnlike operations for flying passengers, Emirates’ freighter flights are dedicated to transporting cargo and do not always originate and end in Dubai. Instead, the flights cover multiple origins and destinations over rotations that last several days. This allows for additional flexibility in cargo operations along with the ability to rapidly and efficiently cargo from where it is produced to markets where it is required by customers.</p>
      <p>Additionally Emirates’ freighter aircraft also operate to destinations that are not covered by passenger flights. Ecuador, for example, is one of the largest flower producing markets in the world and is a cargo-only destination on Emirates’ global network. Emirates’ freighter aircraft transport fresh cut flowers from Quito to Amsterdam via Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. This ensures that the flowers are transported more rapidly from Ecuador to the Netherlands than if the flight had to travel to Dubai and then proceed onwards from Dubai to Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>Over 75 tonnes of fresh flowers were transported on the freighter flights operated by Captain Roz and First Officer McDiarmid from Quito to Aguadilla and from Aguadilla to Amsterdam. Emirates’ freighter flights from Quito create a direct channel for exports for the Ecuadorian floriculture industry to Amsterdam, the world’s largest flower distribution hub. This supports the local economy in Ecuador and the livelihoods of over 100,000 people in the country who work to cultivate and harvest flowers.</p>
      <p>Freighter flights also allow for rapid transportation of goods such as lifesaving medication from the location where they are manufactured to patients who may urgently need them for treatment. Close to 10 tonnes of valuable pharmaceuticals were transported on the freighter flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City operated by the all-women flight deck crew.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo operates scheduled freighter flights to over 40 global destinations every week. In addition, Emirates’ Boeing 777 freighter aircraft also execute a number of on-demand charter operations for clients to deliver a range of commodities from outsized machinery to relief materials. In 2019, Emirates SkyCargo operated over 300 charter operations globally.</p>

      <p>IATA’s January 2020 global air freight report saw a decrease of 3.3% in demand, measured in cargo tonne kilometers (CTKs), compared to the same period in 2019. Cargo capacity, measured in available cargo tonne kilometers (ACTKs), rose by 0.9% year-on-year in January 2020. Capacity growth has outstripped demand growth for 21 consecutive months.</p>
      <p>The report showed that the airlines in Asia-Pacific and Europe suffered sharp declines in year-on-year growth in total air cargo volumes, while North American and Middle East carriers experienced a more moderate decline. Latin America and Africa were the only regions to record growth in air freight demand compared to January 2019.</p>
      <p>Asia-Pacific airlines saw demand for air cargo contract by 5.9% in January 2020, compared to the year-earlier period. This records the sharpest drop in freight demand of any region for the month. Capacity growth was flat. Seasonally-adjusted cargo demand rose slightly however, following the thawing of US-China trade relations. The impact from COVID-19 is expected to affect February’s performance.</p>
      <p>North American airlines saw demand decrease by 1.3% in January 2020, compared to the same period a year earlier. Capacity increased by 3.4%. Seasonally-adjusted cargo demand rose slightly however, amid a more supportive operating environment and following the thawing of US-China trade relations.</p>
      <p>European airlines posted a 3.7% decrease in cargo demand in January 2020 compared to the same period a year earlier – more than double the 1.3%% drop in year-on-year demand in December. Seasonally-adjusted demand also dropped sharply, disrupting the positive trend that started mid-2019. Capacity decreased by 3.0% year-on-year.</p>
      <p>Middle Eastern airlines’ cargo volumes decreased 1.4% in January 2020 compared to the year-ago period. Capacity increased by 2.9%. Against a backdrop of operational and geopolitical challenges facing some of the region’s key airlines, seasonally-adjusted freight volumes ticked down in January, but a modest upwards trend has been sustained. However, given the Middle East’s position connecting trade between China and the rest of the world, the region’s carriers have significant exposure to the impact of COVID-19 in the period ahead.</p>
      <p>Latin American airlines experienced an increase in freight demand in January 2020 of 1.4% compared to January 2019 – reversing the 2.5% decrease in December. Seasonally-adjusted freight volumes in the region also ticked upwards, underpinned by new route connections, which is a positive development for the region’s carriers. Capacity increased by 2.4% year-on-year.</p>
      <p>African carriers posted the fastest growth of any region for the 11th consecutive month in January 2020, with an increase in demand of 6.8% compared to the same period a year earlier. Growth on the smaller Africa-Asia trade lanes (up 12.4% in 2019) contributed to the positive performance. Capacity grew 5.9% year-on-year.</p>
      <p>”January marked the tenth consecutive month of year-on-year declines in cargo volumes. The air cargo industry started the year on a weak footing. There was optimism that an easing of US-China trade tensions would give the sector a boost in 2020. But that has been overtaken by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has severely disrupted global supply chains, although it did not have a major impact on January’s cargo performance. Tough times are ahead. The course of future events is unclear, but this is a sector that has proven its resilience time and again,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO.</p>
      <p>It is unlikely that the COVID-19 outbreak had very much to do with January’s weak performance. The Lunar New Year in 2020 was earlier than in 2019. This skewed 2020 numbers towards weakness as many Chinese manufacturers would be closed for the holiday period. February performance will give a better picture of how COVID-19 is impacting global air cargo.</p>
