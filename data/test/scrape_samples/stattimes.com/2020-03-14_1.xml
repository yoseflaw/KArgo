      <p>Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) reported that an individual associated with an ANC cargo flight tested positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The patient, who is a foreign national, developed a fever and respiratory symptoms soon after arriving in Anchorage on March 11. After contacting the physician, the patient was sent to Alaska Regional Hospital for testing.</p>
      <p>The airport states that cargo flights strictly adhere to guidelines set out by the US Federal Aviation Administration and the US Department of Health and Human Services. “Cargo flights are completely separate from any passenger flights at ANC. Cargo crewmembers never come into contact with general passengers and they do not access the main terminal. Cargo crewmembers are cleared through US Customs and Border Protection agents at ANC’s North Terminal,” asserted the airport authorities through a media release.</p>
      <p>Cargo is not considered a health risk according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the CDC’s 2019 Novel Coronavirus website as it becomes available.</p>

      <p>UPS has a new chief executive officer and she is Carol Tomé. David Abney, the current chairman and chief executive officer, will hold his position until June 1 when he will take on the role of executive chairman of the Board. He will retire from the UPS Board on September 30 after 46 years of service.</p>
      <p>However, Abney will remain a special consultant until the end of 2020 so as to ensure a smooth transition. On September 30, William Johnson, who is UPS’ lead independent director, will become the non-executive chairman.</p>
      <p>“After a rigorous selection process involving both internal and external candidates, Carol was the clear choice,” said Johnson. Johnson also serves as chair of the UPS Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and is a member of the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p>“Carol is one of the most respected and talented leaders in Corporate America and has a proven track record of driving growth at a global organization, maximizing shareholder value, developing talent and successfully executing against strategic priorities,” said Johnson. “As a member of the Board and Chair of the Audit Committee, Carol has in-depth knowledge of UPS’s business, strategy and people, and is the right executive to lead the company at this important time in its transformation.”</p>
      <p>Johnson continued, “We congratulate David on a truly exceptional career at UPS. He has undertaken bold actions to place UPS at the forefront of the transportation industry and position its global network and people to capitalize on emerging trends that will carry the company well into the future.”</p>
      <p>“UPS has been one of my life’s passions and through UPS I have been able to live the American dream,” said David Abney. “I am proud to have worked with UPSers to prepare this great company for its next 100 years. I am confident in the UPS management team and their capabilities to execute our strategies in the future. This is the right time for me to pass the baton. I am extremely pleased for Carol and know she is the best choice to lead the company. She understands UPS’s culture and values, is a strategic leader and possesses a customer-first mindset.”</p>
      <p>“I look forward to working with and further developing the talented management team and the company’s 495,000 employees to deliver for our customers and shareowners,” Carol Tomé said. “David has led a remarkable transformation at UPS and I plan to build on his success. UPS’s rich culture and commitment to its values will guide us as we continue to lead the industry and build on the company’s already strong foundation.”</p>
      <p>Carol Tomé becomes the 12th chief executive officer in the 113-year history of UPS. She has been a member of the UPS Board of Directors since 2003 and serves as Chairperson of the Audit Committee. Tomé is the former executive vice president and chief financial officer of The Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer in the US with 2,300 stores and 400,000 employees. Her responsibilities included corporate strategy, finance and business development. During her 18-year tenure as CFO, she is credited with helping to deliver a 450 percent increase in The Home Depot’s shareholder value.</p>
      <p>Abney was appointed CEO in 2014 and as Chairman in 2016.  Under his leadership, UPS has seen 27 percent increase in revenue while adjusted net income grew close to 50 percent. The company also raised adjusted earnings per share by nearly 60 percent. Abney previously served as Chief Operating Officer since 2007, overseeing logistics, sustainability, engineering and all facets of the UPS transportation network. Before serving as COO, he was president of UPS International, leading the company's strategic initiative to increase its global logistics capabilities. During his career, he was also involved in a number of global acquisitions that included Coyote, Marken, the Fritz Companies, Sonic Air, Stolica, Lynx Express, and Sino-Trans in China. He began his UPS career in 1974 as a package handler in a small facility in Greenwood, Mississippi, while attending Delta State University.</p>

      <p>Airports across the world are looking to transform themselves into cargo hubs. How can Air Cargo Community Systems help?Airports play a very important role in the logistics value chain. These are the hubs of commercial activities and as one of the studies have revealed in the past the air cargo spends more time at the airport for processing and clearing than actually flying which is the core value that the end customer expects.</p>
      <p>Most airports across the world have been traditionally operating a “land-lord” or a “concession” model regarding the air cargo and have thus far kept an arm's length from the core operations or growth of cargo unlike some other airports who have been deeply involved in promotion as well as operations of air cargo. However, times are changing now. With increasing competition, pressure from regulators around security, pressure for creating Trade Facilitation infrastructure to comply with the WTO's Trade Facilitation agreements, the need to increase economic activity and create more jobs; the airport's involvement in the core cargo business is increasing now.</p>
      <p>In order to address the above and ensure customer satisfaction so that the stakeholders are motivated to bring cargo to their airports, the airports have to create next generation digital infrastructure for cargo. We call it creating the “Airport Single Window” for airport's stakeholders that will help in trade facilitation. This is also like building an Air Cargo Community around the airport. The true next generation Airport Cargo Community systems do exactly that for the airports.</p>
      <p>The general expectation is having an ACS will solve all current problems. How true is this statement? Does it make internal automation systems irrelevant?Since supply chain by definition extends beyond the enterprise, having just good IT systems for automation of cargo handling activities is not sufficient. There are serious inefficiency and transparency issues in the supply chain although a lot of stakeholders have their own automation systems in place. Let me give you an example. An MNC forwarder has a world class system, a multinational handling company has a world class system as well.</p>
      <p>However, in the absence of an airport community system, the handler doesn't know how many trucks to expect when and this often leads to congestion and higher dwell times at the airport. This is just one simple case. We have identified around 100 such use cases of a community system which will give you the scale of the problems that can be solved by such single windows. Internal systems are relevant but not sufficient in making the air cargo industry more efficient. The need for effectively connecting to the stakeholders can't be understated.</p>
      <p>Has digitalisation helped stakeholders cut their operating expenses and improve bottom-line?This is very simple to understand. With air cargo community systems, through advance data exchange stakeholders have been able to reduce waiting times at the airports, there's no need to run from pillar to post for shipment processing, there's reduction in duplicate data entry, reduced paper work, reduced mal-practices, better transparency across the supply chain all causing reduced operating expenses and this reduction goes directly to improve the bottom-line. I am personally extremely excited about the proliferation of such community platforms and I believe the industry will change forever with the next generation airport cargo community systems.</p>

      <p>Aerospace logistics provider B&amp;H Worldwide has won a new contract of managing the logistics of aircraft spare parts and engine materials for AOG Technics, a leading independent specialists in the aviation industry, in Germany.</p>
      <p>While both entities have had a previous work relationship for exports to Europe and the USA from the UK, this will be their debut partnership in mainland Europe.  B&amp;H Worldwide's Frankfurt facility will be responsible for storing, dispatching and repacking parts before dispatch with immediate effect. Aero engine blades will be among the top products that will be handled.</p>
      <p>The products from Frankfurt will move to multiple global destinations including the USA, Europe and Asia.  One of the main reasons for AOG Technics’ decision to locate with B&amp;H was Frankfurt being a gateway to Europe and the frequency of international flights to other global hubs.</p>
      <p>Seth Profit, B&amp;H Worldwide's group sales director said, “The location of our Frankfurt office at Cargo City has shown our customers we can provide them with a Forward Stocking Location where they can strategically position inventory in the heart of Europe and we are delighted to welcome AOG Technics to the facility”.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for AOG Technics said, “We are proud of our reputation for providing excellent service and a rapid response 24 hours a day.  We decided to partner with B&amp;H in order to expand our markets and host our inventories in other locations worldwide”.</p>

      <p>IBS Software, global IT solutions provider to the global travel industry, has signed a five-year contract with Lufthansa Cargo AG (LCAG), to take full ownership of the hosting and maintenance of Lufthansa Cargo’s iCAP cargo handling application platform, which is powered by IBS Software’s iCargo cargo management platform.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo’s decision to move to IBS Software’s SaaS hosting platform is part of its long-term objective to focus on its core cargo business without compromising on IT operations. As part of the decision-making process, Lufthansa Cargo evaluated the capabilities of global hosting service providers on critical areas including application availability, security regulatory and data privacy.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo stands to benefit from IBS Software’s industry-first ‘zero outage’ capability for its SaaS offering. With zero outage capability, planned maintenance is completed with absolutely no outage to the business IT system – one of the major benefits for Lufthansa Cargo. This unique capability results in operational stability, which is essential to fulfill the customer promise and to provide effective and seamless cargo handling operations around the clock across all time zones without any service disruptions.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo will also benefit from superior and faster application performance of highly complex cargo business functions and processes. As an example, Lufthansa Cargo processes one million messages per day. Each message will now be processed noticeably faster than before in less than one second on the IBS Software SaaS platform.</p>
      <p>Initial performance of the system, which operates from IBS Software’s new data centre in Frankfurt, has shown that the SaaS service has exceeded the benchmarks in all parameters set by Lufthansa Cargo, with 100 percent SLA compliance.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo CIO Dr. Jochen Göttelmann said, “IBS Software has consistently delivered beyond expectations throughout our relationship that started with the iCAP implementation. They have demonstrated their capability to take on the established leaders in application hosting and offer a true SaaS provisioning that helps us to focus on our core competencies. We greatly value the responsibility and commitment that IBS Software brings to the table.”</p>
      <p>“IBS Software is thrilled to sign up Lufthansa Cargo as a SaaS customer, benefitting from our industry leading iCargo platform hosted in our world class data centres. Lufthansa Cargo’s selection of IBS Software is testament to our excellent track record of iCAP delivery for the past seven years, and our commitment to consistently deliver value to our customers,” said Ashok Rajan, SVP and head of airline cargo services, IBS Software.</p>

      <p>The demand for improved predictability and end-to-end visibility of shipments in transit has never been more significant to the air cargo industry. While there have been notable strides in the adoption of technology with initiatives such as e-freight and digital cargo, digitalisation still remains a challenge with just over one million of e-AWBs used for freight operations by select airlines as of October 2019.</p>
      <p>The digitalisation journey of the airfreight industry has been a long and challenging one. The e-freight concept was initially launched by IATA in 2006 as part of the StB (simplifying the business) programme and became an industry-wide initiative. With more than 30 paper documents being handled for each shipment, the goal established 14 years ago by the e-freight program was to cut delivery cycle times by 24 hours, accelerate and enhance track-and-trace processes and eliminate nearly 8,000 tonnes of paper documents annually – the equivalent of 80 Boeing 747 freighters filled with paper!</p>
      <p>A typical consignment booked by a forwarder and shipped onto an aircraft takes nearly five to six days to reach its consignee, while the time it takes to reach the destination market is less than a day. The rest of the time is often spent in customs formalities and clearance or hung up in the web that includes ground handlers, customs brokers, truckers and importers. This dwell time totally nullifies the benefits of air freight for which a shipper usually pays a premium.</p>
      <p>It is a no-brainer then that digitalization of documentation and the processes will increase the efficiencies in tracking of goods and data exchanges between airlines, trucking companies, forwarders and shippers. It will also reduce costs and delays and ease security compliance and customs clearance issues, leading to an overall improved customer service. The biggest win will be in speed and quality of information exchange, which will happen effectively in real time. Some stakeholders have jumped on the bandwagon however there is still reluctance among some of them to opt for digitalisation of their processes, and that, will only make air freight less attractive to customers.</p>
      <p>“Digitalisation is something that we have talked as an industry for far too long but didn’t really demonstrate the absolute commitment to delivering it. But now, people are investing in the technology and they are committed to working with their partners because there is a certain realization that if we continue to do as we have been doing for the last 3-4 decades, we are going to lose the shippers. We are going to lose the confidence of the e-commerce players, those shipping high value pharma – they want to have access to the information of their shipments throughout the journey. When things go wrong, they want to hear about it when they go wrong and not after the journey has concluded,” explained Glyn Hughes, global head of cargo, IATA.</p>
      <p>“It has taken us such a long time to come to at least reasonable penetration of eAWBs. We are taking a lot of time for it and the reason for that is that there are so many parties involved and it is difficult to get each and everybody on the same level. Only when the end-to-end functionality works, everyone stands to gain,” reasoned Dorothea von Boxberg, member of the executive board and chief commercial officer at Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>“In the increasingly competitive air cargo industry, the whole ecosystem – spanning airlines, warehouses, freight forwarders, booking agents, customs and road/rail transport – must accelerate its digital transformation, to be more efficient, and remain economically viable, as well as enable new business models and better secure the data and goods that are in its care. Some players have made great strides in adopting new technologies, from online marketplaces, to IoT and drones. However, for most of the industry, a fundamental cultural change is required to evolve and create a truly connected supply chain, where stakeholders can work together to share inventory and securely share data with only those who need it,” says Niranjan Navaratnarajah, cargo industry director, Unisys Asia Pacific.</p>
      <p>Unisys’ cargo solutions are used by many leading carriers, who collaborate via the Unisys Cargo User Group (UCUG). Unisys and UCUG members have worked with IATA for more than 20 years on initiatives such as e-Freight, Cargo iQ and XML messaging.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ashok Rajan, senior vice president, IBS Software feels that with the industry being siloed and fragmented, information gets lost between the tracks.  IBS’ mission is to show how airlines can transform themselves into modern, digital enterprises. “It is a three-layered strategy – the first is to get the right platform in place where you can start to work on digitisation. Second is to help people make use of the tool. While we run Centres of Excellence on Artificial Intelligence, we work with our customers in making best use of this platform. The third layer of strategy that we are looking is to build collaboration platforms,” explains Ashok Rajan, IBS. Rajan goes on to say that the company is now working on getting together a series of industry platforms which will help airlines collaborate together when they do joint ventures, and where airlines can talk to their ground handlers seamlessly.</p>
      <p>Getting digitally readySeveral factors could explain the slow adoption of e-AWBs. The primary factor could be the lack of standardization across platforms making communication difficult. The other is the lack of initiative on the part of the stakeholders. Government regulations that require data targeting for security purposes will make it essential to digitise airway bill information for security and trade compliance.</p>
      <p>“To go towards a fully integrated digital network of notes, where each note represents an air cargo player, there are different steps to be taken.  Today, we still have air cargo companies with multiple Excel files, piles of paper and huge archives and are scanning documents, and think that is digitalisation. First of all, we need in-house improvements to make (our) company digitally ready,” believes Sara van Gelder, cargo digital development manager at Brussels Airport. Sara was speaking at a panel discussion on digital cargo strategies at the Cargo Facts EMEA 2020 in Frankfurt held earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Digitalisation is now creating a new value proposition and customer demands are increasing with the industry’s two most promising growth markets, e-commerce and temperature-sensitive goods such as pharmaceuticals and perishables.</p>
      <p>Some digitally focused air carriers such as Lufthansa Cargo, Emirates SkyCargo, Air France KLM and logistic companies have already adopted the e-AWB standard and have created their own APIs to process some advanced digital information. Others are trying to catch up in this dynamic environment where unfortunately a digital industry standard is still missing.</p>
      <p>“At Lufthansa Cargo, we really feel digitalisation can make a really big difference to the industry so that the industry can become a lot more efficient, a lot more transparent and also a lot easier to work in. We make a lot of effort across all areas of air freight to become digital. It is about making air freight capacity booking as easy as buying anything else on the Internet,” said Dorothea.</p>
      <p>Dorothea further added that while she is not very happy with the pace of innovation we have had so far, she does see it accelerate. “I think there is a lot more focus on the topic and there are many more partners investing in it. I am really hoping we are getting to the inflection point,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Digitalisation is high on our agenda at Emirates. Admittedly, we still have a long way to go. We still need to get our basics right in digitalisation. As an industry, we are still lagging behind – if you look at the passenger side of the business, you can very quickly get on to an aircraft with a smartphone. But on the cargo side, in most cases, a physical AWB, paper documentation, certificate of origin, and an invoice with a blue stamp on it – these are barriers that we need to address. So for me, it is about working with all the stakeholders in the entire supply chain and how do we embrace the entire digital roadmap. We are working with multiple partners to do that,” explained Dennis Lister, Emirates SkyCargo.</p>
      <p>Lister also informed that Emirates SkyCargo is now working to build a digital corridor between nations. “We are currently working on a project with the Dubai government on how we can build bilateral relations with other countries to get to a point where we have known entities and have verifiable data among the parties that will allow us to bring or move any product out of the country without having to provide any physical document,” he revealed. This development could really be a big game-changer for the industry.</p>
      <p>Data sharing conundrumOne of the biggest hurdles for the industry lies in the reluctance to share data. With different actors involved in the supply chain, each of these only shares intentions and similar related data when it advances their self-interest. They wish to preserve what is seen by them as a competitive edge.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport’s Sara van Gelder explains how the data sharing practice can be encouraged with a good example. “Suppose you download an app like Ways on your mobile – the moment it asks you to share your location, you are hesitant to do so. However, if you realise that if you do share your location, what you get in return is an efficient or a shorter route to reach your workplace, you are very open to share your location. So it is about finding the carrot and the stick to make stakeholders move towards sharing their data. There are a lot of added values that can push stakeholders towards that goal.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, she emphasizes on the presence of a catalyst who can bring all the actors in the supply chain together. “If stakeholder A shares data proactively to stakeholder B, C, D, E who is going to handle the cargo in our very fragmented supply chain, they can optimise their processes. So while it is interesting, it can also become very complex. Because while you put the effort in it to share the data, you are not the one who will take advantage of it but the next stakeholder who gains from it. Therefore, we need a catalyst that can bring those with different points of view to come together,” said Sara van Gelder.</p>
      <p>Creating a standard for data sharingIATA’s ONE Record initiative is the solution to take digitalisation to the next level by creating a standard for data sharing. The initiative allows the creation of a single record view of a shipment through a standardised and secured web API, thus improving the ease and accuracy of accessing the data. The standard is based on mature but progressive data sharing technologies that are well aligned with the best practices used by leading airlines. This makes it directly accessible to IT teams and service providers.</p>
      <p>“The value of the shipments is going up, and therefore, the concern of the shippers that they need to be constantly monitored. They need to have the supply chain interacting with each other. So, ONE Record is designed as the way of taking data that each party owns and sharing it in a smart fashion. So it is not like one party has all the information and then passes it to the next partner. It is actually a platform where in data is shared on a trusted fashion as you have it in small pieces as it allows each party to reflect and respond to in a much bigger way which will help in industry optimization and efficiency,” clarifies Glyn Hughes.</p>
      <p>ONE Record assumes that there will never be a single data model for anything and everything and, instead, focuses on ontologies. An ontology is essentially a “language” with its meanings and rules. The ONE Record ontology describes the language of air cargo. There are, or will be, other ontologies for other freight modes or other parts of the transport chain.</p>
      <p>“ONE Record envisions a digital plug and play world. “Plug” refers to need for system connectivity without any integration. That may sound too good to be true but in the 70s we faced the same challenge for hardware integration. Now we don’t even question whether or not a peripheral will plug into our computer or server. ONE Record aims for the same seamless connectivity between digital companies and their systems,” said Henk Mulder, head of digital cargo, IATA.</p>
      <p>Tackling data breachGoing digital also brings with it challenges such as cyber attacks and data breach. Data captured about the shipper and the shipment is extremely sensitive and is a valuable target for malicious attacks. “To take advantage of ONE Record, security must be balanced with accessibility. Ultimately the customer owns their data – the eAWB, and should only be accessed when needed by those who have the need and authority to do so. In an environment where ransomware, denial of service attacks and human action (either accidental or malicious) can – and will – occur, the industry must move to a Zero Trust approach to security to prevent breaches and isolate and minimize their impact when they happen,” believes Unisys’ Navaratnarajah.</p>
      <p>In February, WISeKey International Holding, a leading global cybersecurity and IoT company, announced that it was selected by International Air Transport Association (IATA) as its technology partner to secure the ONE Record test platform.</p>
      <p>The WISeKey and IATA collaboration for the ONE Record platform aims to define the security layer to protect all data exchanges in the platform, by introducing the necessary technology components for strong authentication and data encryption. WISeKey will provide this security layer by leveraging its Managed PKI Services, allowing the issuance of trusted digital identities under its worldwide recognized Root of Trust, adopting the best practices in secure identity management and enhancing IATA’s ONE Record platform to securely provide paperless processes and creating a plug-and-play environment where companies can connect and re-connect their digital relations with ease, security and trust.</p>
      <p>WISeKey’s technology integration into the IATA ONE Record platform accelerates the Know Your Customer (KYC) process for stakeholders participating in the platform, and WISeKey’s trusted digital certificates to secure P2M (people to machine) and M2M (machine to machine) interactions allow ONE Record operations to be executed within a trusted ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the association, IATA’s Mulder said, “Ensuring data security is a mandatory requirement for the ONE Record data sharing standard that IATA is developing with the air cargo industry. It is also a requirement where we must work with qualified and experienced solution providers, both for the advice on the design of the security layer, but also in the provision of a test platform. WISeKey meets this requirement and we are delighted to work with this experienced and trusted company.”</p>
      <p>Road ahead Faced with the need to reinvent itself, the air cargo industry has gradually adopted digital opportunities with different levels of maturity. Opportunities are countless and initiatives are on the rise; it is up to the industry to take advantage of these digital opportunities that could add value for the shippers, and in turn, improve links with their business partners. This will help carve the digital roadmap for the industry. All air cargo stakeholders need to follow a common goal to reaffirm the competitiveness of their mode of transportation as against other modes, where the adoption of digital technologies is far more progressive.</p>

      <p>The aviation industry is undergoing a breakthrough with women's participation in the sector but the industry experts are not yet satisfied with the percentage of women working in the sector. IATA 25by2025 campaign, which aims to bring 25 percent of women participation across the sector, has created a door of opportunity for women, bringing 59 airlines to join the campaign to date.</p>
      <p>“Women’s inequality should shame us all in the 21st century because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid. Only through the equal participation of women can we benefit from the intelligence, experience, and insights of all of humanity. That is why I call on all men to support women’s rights and gender equality. It’s time to stop trying to change women, and start changing the systems that prevent them from achieving their potential,” cited António Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations during his speech at The New School, New York on the title ‘Women and Power’ on February 27, 2020.</p>
      <p>Recently, at the air cargo India 2020, held in Mumbai from February 25-27, The STAT Trade Times awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award to air cargo industry veteran Lise-Marie Turpin. She began her career in 1975 with a job in passenger &amp; cargo sales and operations at Air France and then continued to serve various positions at Air Canada Cargo as the senior director, managing director, and vice president, until her retirement in 2017.</p>
      <p>On the sidelines of the event, she said, “I was in cargo business for many years and it is a privilege to receive such a prestigious award. I entered the airline business as a university student looking for a part time summer job. Soon I was very fortunate to have experienced passenger as well as cargo world. The cargo side always had a challenging environment. I was constantly looking for new ways to grow and learn. I had the privilege of working overseas (with both the airlines), which developed my understanding of new markets and different cultures.”</p>
      <p>Though retired, Turpin supports the education of girls and higher education of women in developing countries.</p>
      <p>Considering the fact of empowering women to take up leadership roles will lead to the industry’s success, IATA launched a 25by2025 campaign on September 26, 2019. 25by2025 seeks to address gender balance in civil aviation with a minimum representation of 25 percent of women by 2025. Collectively 59 airlines for the campaign have signatories coming from all continents – Europe (36), Asia-Pacific (10), the Americas (7) and Africa &amp; the Middle East (6).</p>
      <p>Observing IATA encouraging women in the field of aviation, Céline Hourcade, project manager, The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) says, “TIACA doesn’t want to duplicate efforts, but rather to amplify them and start initiatives where nothing exist. I applaud IATA’s 25by2025 campaign! With this campaign, IATA wants to raise awareness of gender inequalities and their impacts and encourage airlines to take conscious decisions to bridge the gaps. Diversity and inclusion disparities also apply to other parts of aviation and logistics. As TIACA represents all parts of the air cargo industry, it is well positioned to support IATA’s 25by2025 campaign by spreading the message to shippers, forwarders, handlers, airports, manufacturers, etc.”</p>
      <p>While it comes to American Airlines (AA) Cargo promoting gender balance, Jessica Tyler, vice president, strategy &amp; development states, “American Airlines Cargo has incredible leaders, whose representative proportion happens to be women. Recently, I sat on a panel and looking into the audience I realised that there is only a handful of women in a room of 150 plus people. And, I was the only woman on the panel. I don’t normally notice my environment in that way, but this experience stuck out to me. I think part of why that moment sticks out is because, within American Airlines Cargo, I am constantly surrounded by equality in gender.”</p>
      <p>Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (Hactl) showcases a long tradition of driving gender equality. “Today, in Hactl management, 3 out of 6 of the most senior executives are women. Elsewhere in our business, considering that many of our activities are heavy manual work, the figure is still quite high at 13 percent. What is more significant is that 32 percent of current managerial grades are female, so we are clearly moving towards a better balance. What we are keen not to do, however, is to artificially favour females in internal promotion and recruitment; we believe securing jobs and promotion should be based on an individual’s attitude, qualifications, knowledge, and capabilities. We ensure everyone has equal opportunity, and then it is down to them, regardless of gender,” notes Vivien Lau, executive director of Hactl.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 2019, under Tyler’s leadership, AA Cargo transitioned the business from 90+ systems (some of which were 40 years old) to a single modern platform as part of the broader modernisation effort. She says, “This project is the most complex effort I have been a part of in my nearly 50 years on the planet. The technology effort is enormous. But I have learned that what is just complex is readying us and our minds for a new way of working. We have invested money, time and energy to make sure we are pushing ourselves into the future but the technology is only as good as the team that knows how to leverage it and create great experiences for our customers. Complexity is reduced when you marry great technology with a team that collaborates and stays focused on the customers.”</p>
      <p>Joining TIACA last September as a consultant to define, launch and drive its sustainability agenda, for Hourcade sustainability has always been very high on her agenda, from her IATA days, where she was in charge of IATA Cargo Sustainability Agenda. “My first contribution was to define what we mean by sustainability and what TIACA’s role will be in the industry in regard to sustainability,” she says. The responsibility does not end here for Hourcade who even serves on the international advisory panel of Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone. “I have indeed been appointed as one of the international experts supporting the development strategies of Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport. One of the focuses I am bringing in the discussion is sustainability as a growth factor for the airport.”</p>
      <p>Lau also performs a dual role. Being Hactl’s executive director, she is even the MD of its subsidiary Hong Kong Air Cargo Industry Services Ltd (Hacis). “In Hactl, I am responsible principally for overall commercial strategies, customer relations, and business development, but I am also involved in general business policy and direction, and these are all areas in which soft skills such as business acumen, negotiating, networking and collaboration, etc. are important. The nature of Hactl’s business means that certain aspects of my work also require a technical understanding of the airfreight business and the innovative and tech-based solutions. I had a lot of early support from my operations team which assisted greatly.  In Hacis, I have led the business into new segments such as e-commerce, and expanded its depot network by 50 percent,” she observes.</p>
      <p>TIACA consists of a very small team and to date, it counts 50 percent women. Its governance, board of directors and chairmen council, are largely male dominated to date, which reflects a lack of women at the top of air cargo companies. Hourcade, who worked earlier with IATA and then went on to start Change Horizon, a consulting company last year, will welcome her first colleague soon to build the team. Talking about her new colleague, Hourcade mentions, “She is as passionate as I am with aviation and logistics, and also wants to contribute to making air cargo (and the world) more sustainable and attractive. During my 13 years with IATA, I dedicated a lot of my time to mentoring younger colleagues, mainly women, as I feel it is one way to advance diversity and include progress in the workplace.”</p>
      <p>Looking at gender alone, American Airlines Cargo management is 54 percent male and 46 percent female. Tyler states, “On my direct team, four out of six are female.  However, I believe the best way to build a team is not to focus on one aspect of diversity, but rather to ensure you have differences that cover as much of the human experience as possible. Ensuring opportunity for our leaders to share and talk about what they love about working at American, and specifically, this industry is the best way to motivate women to join this business.”</p>
      <p>Jaisey Yip, associate general manager cargo &amp; logistics development, Changi Airport Group recollects her boss asking, ‘Would you like to pick up a challenge by being the head of cargo and logistics?’ She accepted the challenge and is serving in the role for three years. Yip believes that traditionally this sector was male dominated but now it has been changing.</p>
      <p>Hactl senior management is 50 percent female, while overall female employment is currently 13 percent. Hactl has a very active recruitment and management trainee programme, and this has resulted in 17 percent female uptake. The strong presence of females on the executive role indicates a clear sign that Hactl welcomes females at all levels. And the company’s policy of constant training and promotion from within provides clear career progression.</p>
      <p>Delta Cargo’s managing director – global cargo sales Eric J Wilson says that very few women participate in the decision making process. “We need to increase women's participation in this industry. When I travelled to China and Taiwan, I was very much impressed with the number of women holding senior positions.” At Delta Cargo, there is a circle named She Leads, which is designed to bring more women into managerial roles and Wilson is the executive sponsor for the same. Currently, Delta Cargo’s global sales team has 50 percent female and is aiming to increase those numbers this year.</p>
      <p>Widely known as a conservative economy, UAE’s Emirates SkyCargo worked towards the cause of motivating women in the aviation, which was evident by the appointment of Alyazeya Saeed and Fatma Ahli as cargo managers of Oman and Kuwait, respectively, in 2019. The story continues this year, when the five B777Fs flown by captain Ellen Roz, first officer Heidi McDiarmid, and captain Heather Wolf covering close to 30,000 kilometres, across four continents in 10 days – marked another milestone in the history of Emirates SkyCargo. The flights were operated from Frankfurt to Mexico City onwards to Quito, Aguadilla, Amsterdam and finally to Dubai transporting over 306 tonnes of cargo ranging from fresh flowers, fruits, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>Women constitute more than 40 percent of the total workforce at Emirates with the majority working as cabin crew. Women from over 160 nationalities, including more than 1,100 Emiratis, are employed across the Emirates Group in operational roles in functions including flight operations, engineering, aircraft maintenance &amp; appearance, catering, cargo, ramp operations, among others.</p>
      <p>As per the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law 2020 study, the 10 economies that improved the most were Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nepal, South Sudan, São Tomé and Príncipe, Bahrain, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Jordan, and Tunisia. The study explores the relationship between women’s empowerment and economic outcomes. It found that over time, reforms increasing women’s equality of opportunity contribute to more successful economies, higher female labour force participation, and better development outcomes.</p>
      <p>When queried about multi-tasking skills to navigate ambiguity and complexity to make work ideas great, Tyler depicts an interesting picture. She mentions, “I use the mantra ‘adapt or die’. If you are not constantly evolving and aware of what is happening all around you, you risk not existing any more.  Adapting to industry trends and technology advancements often mean adapting to the challenges that come with the transition, many of which are complex or ambiguous. I believe the key to succeeding is more about willing to change and adjust to new ways of work, rather than how much work you can balance at once. So, maybe the word here should be adaptability, rather than multi-tasking. And that is not gender-specific.”</p>
      <p>Along the similar lines, Lau cites, “It is true that women can sometimes bring a different perspective and that can help any group in reaching a more balanced decision. But that is not just a gender issue: a winning team always comprises people of different character and a strong opinion.”</p>
      <p>With an encouraging piece of advice to women, Tyler concludes, “Follow your talent. Whatever you are good at, whatever those core strengths are that make you unique, the things you naturally do better than others – there’s a place for that talent in any industry. In the aviation and logistics industries, you can apply your talents and have 10 different careers all within the same great organisation. Be open to new applications of your unique strengths. This industry needs a fresh perspective and people who bring their talent to bear on the challenges.”</p>
      <p>Finally, veteran Turpin’s advice to the industry is – ‘without restricting to a particular gender try to tap more talents’.</p>
      <p>The Women, Business and the Law 2020 study estimate that over the last two years, 40 economies from all regions and income groups have made women’s economic empowerment a priority by executing 62 reforms facilitating women’s entry into the workforce. Such reforms allow governments to cultivate a business environment that benefits women entrepreneurs and employees, enhancing economic productivity and accelerating development.</p>

      <p>It is said when China sneezes, the rest of the world catches cold. How true? With Covid-19 originating in Wuhan, claiming several lives and now becoming a global pandemic, China decides to shut its factories to deal with SARS-Cov-2. But the world now suffers not just from Covid-19 but from a severe acute shortage of global supplies. How serious is the issue of excessive reliance on Chinese-built global supply chains and its impact on the global air cargo industry?</p>
      <p>In July 2019, the international research institution, Mckinsey Global Institute published a report named ‘China and the World: Inside the dynamics of a changing relationship’ which in short compares how much China is exposed to the world versus world is exposed to China and analyses potential opportunities and threats due to this relationship.</p>
      <p>The report reads, “The country is becoming less exposed in economic terms to the rest of the world. However, reflecting China’s rise to being the world’s second-largest economy and its leading trading nation, the rest of the world is becoming more exposed to China. Our simulation shows that $22 trillion to $37 trillion of economic value (equivalent to about 15 to 26 percent of global GDP by 2040) could be at stake from less or more engagement between China and the world.”</p>
      <p>The researchers would have never thought that they would get an opportunity to test their premises as fast as in just five months. The outbreak of Covid-19 at the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December 2019 and its eventual spreading into South Asia, Middle East and Europe have kept the global air cargo, and in fact the global economy, at the brink of another recession.</p>
      <p>Right now, close to 40 percent of total cargo capacity has been stripped from the Asia-Europe and Trans-Pacific East Bound (TPEB) tradelanes.</p>
      <p>$30 billion revenue loss for Asia Pacific airlines International Air Transport Association (IATA) in its initial assessment predicted that airlines in the Asia-Pacific will suffer a reduction of $27.8 billion from their revenues. When you close a supply chain for a length of time you then put a financial burden on organizations and companies to continue on a financially strong position. So there is now a heightened risk that the global economy falls into a recession and then it will have an impact on the air cargo industry also.</p>
      <p>Glyn Hughes, global head of cargo, IATA said “When we finished 2019, we came back from 12 months of consecutive industry contraction. We had a forecast over 2 percent growth in 2020 with the ending of trade tensions and signing of the phase-1 trade agreement between the US and China. We were expecting a return to growth this year.”</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, nobody could foresee the impact of what occurred in Wuhan and the coronavirus will have not just on the air cargo industry but, in fact, on the global economy. A number of supply chains have been dramatically affected. China is such a significant component of the global economy that it is impacting every region in the world,” he added.</p>
      <p>Niall van de Wouw, managing director, Clive Data Services (the company that introduced an improved and dynamic methodology to calculate air cargo load factor) said “The situation is unique and the magnitude of its impact on global air cargo is unprecedented. Because China is not only an important market but also the yield obtained by airlines from China is much higher than they could get from other markets. The decrease of airfreight volumes out of China has resulted in the dynamic load factor from Europe &amp; Middle East to China and Hong Kong being higher than the westbound load factor for the first time in 25 years.”</p>
      <p>No belly available  In fact, most passenger airlines have stopped operations to/from China at least until March/April and some have even suspended till May/June thus removing the belly capacity by which Chinese market moved 45 percent of all its cargo.</p>
      <p>Mark Sutch, Regional General Manager – South Asia, Middle East and Africa, Cathay Pacific Airways said “For us, Hong Kong is a huge cargo hub and there has been a significant impact, but one thing to point out is as a multi-carrier, in other words, a cargo operator and a passenger operator, we’ve been able to manage the capacity quite well. We haven’t changed our freighter schedule. Due to the reduction in the belly space capacity, not only by Cathay but also by other airlines, there is a lot of demand for cargo in a limited capacity environment. The freighters are highly utilised.”</p>
      <p>Rippling effect on the air transport network The Covid-19 also had some indirect effect on the economy all world regions and thus reducing the cargo volumes significantly even between countries not affected. As the factories of china are shut inventories of the US and Europe are also depleting. The IATA research has shown that traffic has collapsed on key Asian routes and that this is rippling throughout the air transport network globally, even between countries without major outbreaks of Covid-19.</p>
      <p>Max Conrady, Senior Vice President Cargo, Fraport AG said “We could see an increase in freight and service rates. But they are direct effect; there are also indirect effects of coronavirus like disruptions in the supply chain in Germany. The German car manufactures that rely on electronic parts coming from China are running short of supplies due to factory shutdowns. 25 percent of middle-sized German manufacturers are affected. Export of fabricated goods from Germany is slowing down because the prefabricated goods coming from China are missing.”</p>
      <p>“Automobile, machinery parts, consumer products with reliance on electronic parts are affected. Asia is the largest market for Frankfurt airport especially when it comes to e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and electronic parts. There are many consumer goods imported to china from Germany are also affected. Both the inbound and outbound are affected,” he added.</p>
      <p>Chinese exposure The outbreak has outrightly exposed the overreliance of the global economy on China and its significance for the air cargo industry.  On the last week of February, the United States market witnessed the worst week since the financial crisis of 2008 as Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 fell by 12 percent and investors rushed to dump stocks.</p>
      <p>Companies with more exposure to China, like Apple, Nvidia, Procter &amp; Gamble, Qualcomm and Qorvo, are struggling with production capacity. For example, there is a shortage in iPhone camera lens shipments from the supplier Genius Electronic Optical which will have an effect on the overall production of iPhones.</p>
      <p>Global analysts are now calling out for diversification of exposure which will make companies more resilient to an outbreak like Covid-19. The trade tensions between China and the US have already pushed companies to diversify their production centres to other South Asian countries. However, acceleration of such a trend would mean huge shifts in air cargo routes and market though concerns persist.</p>
      <p>Neel Jones Shah, executive vice president and global head of airfreight, Flexport said, “We’ve seen a rash of supply chain diversification since the start of the US-China trade war. The smart brands are investing heavily in Southeast Asia and minimizing their exposure to China. For example, in a 2019 analysis of Flexport clients, we found year-over-year airfreight volumes from China only increased by single-digit percentages, while airfreight from the Philippines and Vietnam increased by triple and double-digit percentages, respectively.”</p>
      <p>“However, China is still an incredibly important global air cargo market. Compared to neighbouring countries, it has superior logistics infrastructure that’s able to handle the volume and complexity of many products; everything from retail to consumer electronics. Unless you diversified your supply chain prior to Chinese New Year and coronavirus containment practices, there are few current alternatives for shippers moving via airfreight,” he added.</p>
      <p>Hughes said “When the trade tensions were escalating with a 25 percent increase in tariffs of certain commodities, it was already impacting the financial viability of focusing on one single market as a major production centre. So if you take last eighteen months there is already been a great deal of investment coming to Vietnam, Malaysia and Turkey.”</p>
      <p>Airfreight rates For as long as Covid-19 impacts the supply chain, customers should anticipate that they will see rising prices on goods coming from China. Rates have increased for exports to China by 3x to 4x from January. Short term costs of supply chain optimization are going to increase, as the market has seen with the US-China trade war before shippers can absorb the burden of increased costs and passing them on to customers.</p>
      <p>“It’s proven quite challenging to ship goods by air into China since passenger flights have been cancelled, and now there are heavy backlogs in the U.S. and Europe for China-bound flights. We expect this to get better as most freighter flights are added, but rates could remain elevated for quite some time. Transit times will be longer and prices will likely be higher. Shippers are going to have to get creative during this period in terms of the routes their goods take to reach them, and their priority is going to have to be keeping the supply chain moving, rather than on the short term costs of supply chain optimisation,” said Shah.</p>
      <p>“We’re looking closely at the retail exports from China. The apparel industry — especially fast fashion — largely depends on air freight. If the fast fashion industry isn’t able to receive their goods within their typical lead times then they could be in trouble. This is yet another reminder to brands that they need to diversify their supply chains. If they haven’t already, this may prompt them to start investing in bulk space agreements (BSAs) originating from cities like Bangkok, Singapore and Taipei as opposed to concentrating in China,” he added.</p>
      <p>Air cargo is standing on the frontline “Even though it is a crisis, it is the time for the air cargo industry to demonstrate its value. Air cargo operators have continued to fly in fact some have even increase operations to make sure that vital medical aid, water, face masks and other equipment to help the people of China reduce the risk of further spreading of the virus. Once the control of the spreading of the disease has been managed, air cargo industry will be on the frontline to get that vital cargo out of China and to rest of the world where it is vitally needed,” said Hughes.</p>
      <p>Steve Townes, Chairman &amp; CEO, ACL Airshop and President, CEO &amp; Founder of Ranger Aerospace said “I personally believe the coronavirus will get worse before it gets better. Our company is hoping for the best but preparing for tough times just in case. For example, we have substantial operations in 16 airports in the entire Asia Pacific area. Some of our staffs are in places like Shanghai and Hong Kong and we are doing everything we can to keep our people safe by allowing them to work on different schedules, working from home and sending masks. But make no mistake, coronavirus at this point of time is a new wild card and it is not good for the air cargo industry.”</p>
