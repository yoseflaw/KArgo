      <p>Airlines and forwarders are beginning to release their plans for transatlantic air freight over the coming weeks – and rates are starting to surge.</p>
      <p>Some carriers have promised existing bookings will be honoured for between two days and a week, after which there will be rolling bookings, while forwarders are talking of being quoted from €6.50 per kilo to £10 per kg out of the UK into the US, which is “unheard of”.</p>
      <p>Companies are trying to ensure air freight routes out of mainland Europe to the US are maintained. Geodis announced this morning it is launching a four-times-a-week round-trip service next week. It will operate from Liege to Chicago, with connecting services to US and European gateways.</p>
      <p>Dachser said it was extending its chartered air freight service between Frankfurt and China. From Monday, it will offer round trips to the US, Latin America and Frankfurt, to Shanghai.</p>
      <p>“This programme puts us in a position to offer a robust and reliable premium air service to Asia for our customers in the Americas as well,” said Timo Stroh, head of global air freight.</p>
      <p>“We are ready for whatever happens on the air freight market in the coming weeks, and fully appreciate being in a position to tackle the challenges of the future today.”</p>
      <p>But despite various new arrangements, Flexport warned shippers that they could face shortages as available capacity plummets.</p>
      <p>“There will inevitably be some supply chain bottlenecks and inventory shortages as a result of longer transit times and fewer connections and opportunities on a per airport-pair-basis,” said Jan van Casteren, vice president Europe.</p>
      <p>“For businesses trading in the US, it’s imperative that they prepare for space limitations over the coming weeks, and fluctuations in freight costs as a result.”</p>
      <p>He advised: “There are a number of steps organisations can take to minimise potential delays and unexpected costs, and supply chain visibility will be crucial when planning and forecasting for any disruption.”</p>
      <p>Flexport said it would use its real-time visibility to help shippers choose the best routings.</p>
      <p>“This might be looking at moving cargo onto flights from the UK, while they still remain in operation, onto charter flights or ocean liners, or onto flights to neighbouring countries like Mexico or Canada, and then using cross-border trucking services.”</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Group said its passenger airlines would continue to fly to Chicago, Newark and Washington and that it was drawing up a special flight schedule. However, all the group’s other flights to the US are suspended until further notice. Canada flights will continue. Its freighter services will also operate as per the schedule, apart from to China. You can find the details here.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson added: “If a shipment is affected by flight cancellations or changes, it will be rebooked automatically.”</p>
      <p>Delata, which, with partners AF-KLM and Virgin, make up nearly one-quarter of transatlantic market share, said its last westbound flights to six destinations was today. It has also placed an embargo on pet transport and human remains.</p>
      <p>American Airlines has its flight details here.</p>
      <p>IAG Cargo, as yet unaffected by President Trump’s travel ban, said it was  “still open for business on transatlantic routes”, but advised customers to “stay in close conversation with your local sales representative”.</p>
      <p>As one forwarder noted, pointing to the carrier announcements: “Their rates have jumped though, unsurprisingly. They didn’t mention that part.</p>
      <p>“What a world we live in. You couldn’t have made this up two months back.”</p>
      <p>And to illustrate that point, two charts released today by the TAC Index summarise the craziness rather well.</p>

    <title>Fiata failed us and is not 'fit for purpose' in a digital age, claims veteran forwarder</title>

      <p>Fiata and other forwarding associations have failed the industry and should be restructured, claims veteran freight forwarder Steve Walker.</p>
      <p>In a speech in Amsterdam this week, Mr Walker argued that ‘data conferences’ such as TradeLens, which appear to have replaced the liner conferences of old, have been overlooked by the forwarding industry – which should have been protecting its data.</p>
      <p>“Our historical suppliers, the container lines, are leaping forward decades, having been unwilling or unable to give forwarders supporting data for decades.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful that they are digitising and bringing together all their suppliers – certainly for their own benefit – on blockchain, but equally, hopefully, for freight forwarders.</p>
      <p>“I just wish that the data offerings had included forwarders at inception.</p>
      <p>“It has to be recognised that we have more microdata and will be reluctant to give this up to create future data revenue streams for the carriers.”</p>
      <p>Pointing to the IBM/ Maersk TradeLens blockchain group, which was approved by the FMC on 6 February, he said Fiata should have been involved from the start.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t realise the FMC was dealing with data/software and data storage organisations …[but] it is to the shame of freight forwarding that Fiata completely missed it.</p>
      <p>“It [has] became abundantly clear that the lead [forwarding] association, Fiata, is not fit for purpose.</p>
      <p>“Acting director general Steve Morris came out in support of the need for change, and accepted Fiata was not leading the forwarder into the digitised debate.</p>
      <p>“Three years ago there was a presentation at Fiata suggesting that it create its own blockchain initiative. It was well received. Nothing was done with it. If that had been a commercial business, the person at the top who had responsibility for that non-action would have been fired.</p>
      <p>“In an association where there is no accountability, there is no consequence.</p>
      <p>“I would suggest the majority of the people at the top, who seem to me to be the blocking cork in a good bottle of red wine, need to be removed so that expertise and frontline experience can replace them to help Fiata re-establish its credibility.</p>
      <p>“Fiata needs to become the forum for freight forwarders …to feel free to discuss defining matters. It needs to become a data association, it needs to be more commercial, and have a media presence.</p>
      <p>“Forwarders should join Fiata directly, in addition to their country association. And as the industry wants stronger leadership, it will have to make a greater financial membership contribution.</p>
      <p>He pointed to the ‘new start’ at Fiata, with recently appointed director general Stephane Graber.</p>
      <p>“I asked Fiata to move closer to its customer base, perhaps a Northern European port. Well, the good news is it is moving closer to water – from Zurich to Lake Geneva.”</p>
      <p>Mr Walker also lambasted Clecat, which has spent four years working on the European CORE digitisation project – which put the blame on forwarders for poor data communication.</p>
      <p>“But what steps did Clecat take to mitigate the damage to its customers, and those of Fiata, if this was the decision the project was coming to? If the associations cannot come together to head off bad publicity, or seek improvement, then what is their value?”</p>
      <p>“There appears to be too much pontificating, not enough front-line action and no cohesive cross-association working.</p>
      <p>“If we as sector are coming together, so too should the associations, maybe to create a super data association.”</p>
      <p>Mr Walker did, however, note one silver lining.</p>
      <p>“There is an acceptance of competing companies meeting, providing there is no complicity or collusion on rates and services, and that those companies can have discussions on collective software offerings.</p>
      <p>“Which is something to build on.”</p>

    <title>Battle for business via online offerings heats up among forwarder ranks</title>

      <p>The trend towards defined services that shippers can book online is spreading – and it is not limited to the multinational logistics players.</p>
      <p>Smaller forwarders are gearing up to join the battle for business their sales staff could not previously get near.</p>
      <p>The latest from the large operator pool to unveil a line of digital offerings is Damco, the forwarding arm of the AP Møller Group.</p>
      <p>Last week, it launched three services clients can book online, and besides booking, all three feature full track and trace functionality.</p>
      <p>The services are a standard product for air or ocean cargo: a Plus service for regular customers, that features a dedicated customer portal with various access levels and role-specific to-do lists; and a Customised product with tailored features like customised reports and an order management system that gives visibility from purchase order to proof of delivery on a dashboard, as well as third-party updates.</p>
      <p>“We have simplified and refined our offering after listening to our customers’ feedback,” said Damco chief executive Saskia Groen-in’t-Woud.</p>
      <p>Damco has eschewed a price-quoting tool for the new line-up, but on the other hand, the new services go beyond general cargo to cover all commodities currently handled by the company under HBLs, according to COO Martin Ring.</p>
      <p>“We anticipate that 80% of our customers will be using Standard service,” he said.</p>
      <p>But smaller forwarders are gearing up for the battle for online clients.</p>
      <p>“We are evaluating service providers in view of integrating such services for clients into our system,” said Karl-Heinz Legler, general manager of Rutherford Global Logistics.</p>
      <p>And Quick Cargo Service is preparing to set up a platform to present its products online. The idea is to put all rates from its carriers into the system and set up tariffs for every postal code in the company’s home market in Germany, integrating elements like customs clearance, documents processing and so on.</p>
      <p>This should allow the customer to select a transit time, obtain a quote for a standard service and book a shipment with one click, said chief executive Stephan Haltmayer. The project is in the planning stage and should go live soon, he added.</p>
      <p>More and more forwarders are offering online products, joining the race between traditional forwarders and the likes of Flexport, added Mr Haltmayer.</p>
      <p>“I think we have all realised that we have to put our products online,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added that doing so would funnel forwarders’ offerings onto rate platforms, where they will sit side by side with the services of the large multinational players, which have more leverage to achieve lower rates.</p>
      <p>Most SME forwarders have tried to avoid this, emphasising the service element rather than price, but Mr Haltmayer sees a need to offer customers both a standardised online option and the traditional service element.</p>
      <p>While online bookings account for a small portion of the overall business, perhaps 5%-10%, it is traffic forwarders traditionally would get, and now stand to lose. To keep it, they have to join the online race, even though the lion’s share of their activities remains on the direct client service side, he reckons.</p>

      <p>The off-docks at Chittagong have stopped handling the containers of Maersk Line, OOCL and Gold Star Line, as part of a dispute over fees.</p>
      <p>Since Wednesday morning, the depots have provided no service to these shipping lines, which have a 20%-25% market share in transporting export cargo.</p>
      <p>In January, the depots raised fees by nearly 22%, a rise the shipping lines did not accept and they have paid no bills since then, according to the Bangladesh Inland Container Depots Association (BICDA).</p>
      <p>“They owe over $2.5m to the 18 off-docks,” BICDA secretary Ruhul Amin Sikder, told The Loadstar. “Moreover, they are not accepting our bills. How we can provide services to them?”</p>
      <p>He added: “We will resume services for them only after they make the payment.”</p>
      <p>Mr Sikder said South Korean Hanjin Shipping, declared bankrupt in 2017, still owes $3.5m, while another line owes $2.95m.</p>
      <p>“What will happen if these lines also stop business here, due to coronavirus? How we will be able to recover the money?” he asked.</p>
      <p>He said the depots set fees in line with a report by the Chittagong Port Authority. The majority of outbound containers are handled by the Chittagong-based off-docks. Cargo reaches the depots from factories mainly by truck and covered van and are stuffed in containers.</p>
      <p>They are then sent to port jetties to board feeder vessels bound for hub ports in Singapore, Colombo and Port Klang to be reloaded on mother vessels for final destinations.</p>
      <p>“The deadlock will disrupt our exports severely,” said Selim Hossain, a Dhaka-based garment exporter, who believes the depots should not have raised the fees without consensus with shippers.</p>
      <p>“When the country’s exports are facing disruption due to the coronavirus epidemic, and continue declining, we can’t pay increased fees.</p>
      <p>“The depots should resume the services immediately and government needs to intervene before the trade faces a further blow,” Mr Hossain added.</p>

    <title>Transatlantic air freight rates to soar as US imposes Europe travel ban</title>

      <p>Transatlantic air freight rates are expected to soar, possibly overnight, following the US travel ban on mainland Europe, excluding – for now – the UK and Ireland.</p>
      <p>Up to 80% of air freight capacity on the transatlantic could be cut as airlines ground passenger flights, with bellies normally taking the lion’s share of the capacity on the route.</p>
      <p>“IAG, Air Canada, Virgin and Aer Lingus are all going to be very busy,” said one senior air freight analyst.</p>
      <p>“There is a tremendous amount of trade between the two continents, and the vast majority is in bellies. If that capacity plunges, you can only imagine the reduction in trade on the Atlantic. There is going to be tremendous pressure on capacity.”</p>
      <p>One European forwarder told The Loadstar: “This is going to be another case of ‘pay to play’. Where prices are going to go is anyone’s guess.”</p>
      <p>But he suggested that rates, which are normally about 65p per kg from the UK to the east coast US, could likely go to £2 per kg shortly. Charters could rise to $7.50 per kg, according to one calculation cited.</p>
      <p>Current dynamic load factors on the transatlantic are 78% westbound, and 60% eastbound, according to Clive Data Services. Even with a modest assumption of 60% of the capacity removed, demand is easily going to outstrip supply.</p>
      <p>“There are so few airlines with freighters left,” said the analyst. “The US majors have none, it’s really only Lufthansa and AF-KLM, and they have cut their freighter fleets. This is a big gift for IAG.”</p>
      <p>Forwarders said that any BSAs on non-cut capacity would be unlikely to be honoured by the airlines, and in any event, most contracts would only last until the end of the month.</p>
      <p>“The US market tends to work on spot rates anyway, as there is so much transatlantic capacity, and it’s cheap. The market rarely becomes overwhelmed. But if I was BA now, I wouldn’t take any forward bookings, and I’d implement penalties for no-shows.”</p>
      <p>Airlines throughout Europe are said to be in meetings to determine how to manage their capacity, with more information expected this afternoon. Some are already talking about using passenger aircraft just to move freight on the transatlantic – and are looking to command a high price for it.</p>
      <p>Trucking is also expected to be key, with mainland European carriers looking to fly goods into Canada and Mexico on passenger aircraft, and trucked over the borders into the US. In Europe, forwarders are looking to truck freight into the UK for Virgin and IAG flights into the US.</p>
      <p>“Cargo is going to be redirected and trucked,” said one forwarder. “The multinational forwarders will already be diverting it to the UK.”</p>
      <p>However, belly capacity from the UK has already been cut. BA announced on 2 March it was cutting back transatlantic flights as passenger demand fell. Norwegian cancelled 22 long-haul flights between Europe and the US from 28 March to 5 May.</p>
      <p>One forwarder also questioned whether the US would extend its ban.</p>
      <p>“Will Trump work out that the UK is in Europe? And if you look at Heathrow Terminal 5 (BA’s hub), it is full of passengers in transit, it’s a mighty pot of thousands of Europeans. What’s going to stop them going to the US? And how long will the UK and Ireland stay open? It could be that freighters become the only capacity.”</p>
      <p>The analyst added: “This really shows how flexible we are as human beings. If you’d said a few weeks ago that the transatlantic would effectively be closed, no one would have believed you. But the industry will adapt, as it always does.”</p>

      <p>All bets are off on transport costs as China’s output moves back towards pre-virus outbreak levels.</p>
      <p>Amid mounting signs of supply chain disruption and a swathe of cost increases, deadlines for annual contract talks are receding into the future, leaving companies to chart uncertain waters with contingency plans stretched to the limits and beyond.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of anxiety,” reported John Haber, chief executive of logistics expenditure consultancy Spend Management.</p>
      <p>“It’s certainly a tremendous challenge. It’s very hard to predict what’s going to happen.”</p>
      <p>Various sources report that Chinese output has rebounded and is now approaching pre-virus levels.</p>
      <p>“There were many indications this week of Chinese manufacturing returning to life. Even the city of Wuhan is taking initial steps back to normal,” Freightos noted today.</p>
      <p>“One interesting sign that production is picking up is the spike in intra-Asia air cargo rates – indicating that Chinese factories are restocking the components they need to manufacture the backlog of orders caused by the shutdown,” it added.</p>
      <p>US importers are bracing for a surge in imports, with the combination of pent-up demand from the extended Chinese New Year hiatus and reduced vessel capacity from blanked sailings pointing to strong demand for eastbound capacity.</p>
      <p>“Because of the backlog, we’re going to see a lot of freight coming in,” Mr Haber said.</p>
      <p>Already the disruption to US import supply chains is significant. According to a survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), almost 75% of US companies have experienced supply chain disruption, due to repercussions of the pandemic. Average lead times have more than doubled from the end of 2019, the ISM report indicates.</p>
      <p>“Companies are faced with a lengthy recovery to normal operations in the wake of the virus outbreak,” said ISM chief executive Thomas Derry.</p>
      <p>The prospect of lingering capacity limitations is exacerbating the situation.</p>
      <p>“Equipment and space availability is a concern across the globe,” noted Crane Worldwide Logistics yesterday.</p>
      <p>The outlook for air cargo is even more ominous, with passenger flight schedules slashed drastically. Even postal volumes are stuck – Korea Post announced that it suspended air mail to Chile because of lack of airfreight capacity.</p>
      <p>In the US, the trucking market is still slow, but Mr Haber expects this to change quickly as import volumes pick up and disruptions occur in the US.</p>
      <p>There is near universal agreement that a spike in imports will stretch capacity and lead to soaring rates, but when this will happen and how long it lasts is anybody’s guess.</p>
      <p>The National Retail Federation’s Global Port Tracker projects US imports in March will be down 18.3% from a year ago, and 3.5% behind the April 2019 volume one month later. For May and June, it predicts volumes to be up 9.3% and 9.6%, respectively, over the corresponding months last year.</p>
      <p>Shipping lines are expected to raise rates next week, or on April 1, following announcements of increases on Asia-Europe sectors. Airfreight rates are already on the rise. One carrier that operates freighters to China has binned existing rates for loose cargo and pre-built shipments with immediate effect, according to one forwarder.</p>
      <p>Rate hikes are flanked by various surcharges, from demurrage to fees for getting hold of empty containers in some markets. Somewhat perplexingly, FedEx and UPS have announced increases in their fuel surcharges, despite the current slump in oil prices, Mr Haber noted.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see their justification,” he said.</p>
      <p>With the prospect of looming rate hikes, airlines are in no hurry to conclude contract negotiations with their clients.</p>
      <p>“It looks like contract negotiations are going to be pushed back,” Mr Haber said. “It’s an unstable environment now.”</p>
      <p>This leaves shippers and importers largely exposed to the ad hoc market, with smaller players in danger of losing out.</p>
      <p>“You get people who try to hog the capacity,” Mr Haber said. “The likes of Home Depot and Lowes are bringing in a lot of goods.”</p>
      <p>He estimates that probably 70% of US companies have contingency plans, but these are not able to shield them from the impact of the disruptions from the pandemic.</p>
      <p>“With this type of issue you can have a lot of contingency plans, but it’s spreading everywhere. You can’t put a distribution centre on the moon,” he added.</p>

      <p>MSC is deploying the world’s biggest ships to evacuate empty containers from China to the US, as carriers on the transpacific try to overcome imbalances after weeks of coronavirus disruption to their box control systems.</p>
      <p>There have been reports of severe equipment shortages in the US and Europe as a consequence of carriers blanking around half of all headhaul sailings since Chinese New Year, due to the Covid-19 virus outbreak.</p>
      <p>Alphaliner said MSC was redeploying the 23,756 teu MSC Mia to the transpacific leg of the 2M’s North Europe-Asia-USWC, combined AE1/Shogun-TP-6/Pearl, loop, and it will be the largest container vessel ever to call at the US.</p>
      <p>It added that two weeks later the 23,656 teu MSC Nela would shift from the AE2/Swan Asia-North Europe loop to the transpacific, to perform a similar function.</p>
      <p>Alphaliner noted that, by replacing the normal 13,000 teu-plus ships that habitually operate its transpacific strings, MSC and 2M partner Maersk would be able to reposition more than 6,000 teu of empty containers to the US to ease pent-up booking demand.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the damage to the US San Pedro Bay ports’ throughput by China’s enforced manufacturing lockdown is evidenced by February figures, just released by the Los Angeles and Long Beach port authorities.</p>
      <p>At Los Angeles, the largest box port in North America, imports plummeted 22.5% last month, compared with February 2019, to 270,025 teu, while exports declined by 5.7%, to 134,468 teu. Empty container movements slumped by 35% to 139,544 teu.</p>
      <p>At neighbouring Long Beach, imports dropped by 17.9%, to 248,592 teu, although exports were actually ahead by 19.3%, to 125,559 teu, and empty containers were down 12.8% to 164,277 teu.</p>
      <p>However, executive director for the port of Long Beach Mario Cordero was optimistic about recovery.</p>
      <p>“Once the virus is contained, we may see a surge of cargo, and our terminals, labour and supply chain will be ready to handle it,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, notwithstanding hopes of a “v-shaped” bounce-back among ports and carriers, one leading liner analyst is warning that the industry is facing a contraction in global container volumes not seen since the financial crash of 2008.</p>
      <p>Via his Linked-In platform, SeaIntelligence Consulting’s Lars Jensen warned that with the pandemic rapidly escalating in Europe and the US, the shutdown of non-essential public workplaces, events and leisure activities would see import demand drop sharply.</p>
      <p>“Hence the expectation of a surge out of China to make up for the earlier shortfall will be postponed,” said Mr Jensen.</p>
      <p>He added that if the virus crisis played out in a similar fashion to the financial crash, when consumers and businesses suddenly reigned-in their spending, it could result in a 10% contraction in container volumes, equalling a shrinking of some 17m teu globally for container lines and a loss of around 80m teu for container ports and terminals.</p>

    <title>Pandemic looks set to hit Cathay Pacific hard, after a 'challenging' 2019</title>

      <p>Cathay Pacific is expecting a “substantial loss” in the first half of the year, due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>Reporting its 2019 financial results yesterday, the carrier said it had faced “an incredibly challenging environment” because of the intensification of the US-China trade war and social unrest in Hong Kong, which drove the city into recession.</p>
      <p>“As a result, our second-half results – traditionally stronger compared with first-half results – fell well below what we would have hoped for,” said Cathay Pacific chairman Patrick Healy.</p>
      <p>The group’s second-half attributable profit was HK$344m (US$44.3m), compared with HK$1.3bn in the first-half, with full-year earnings plunging 28% year on year.</p>
      <p>Mr Healy said Cathay’s cargo business performed “significantly below expectations” last year – revenue falling 14.2%, to HK$21.1bn (US$2.7bn).</p>
      <p>Total cargo carried was down 6%, to 2m tonnes, with cargo revenue tonne km down 6.7% and load factors down 4.4%. Cargo yield decreased 7.9% to HK$1.87.</p>
      <p>“Cargo demand was depressed all year as a result of US-China trade tensions and was noticeably below that of 2018,” Mr Healy explained.</p>
      <p>“However, it did pick up later in 2019, during the traditional high season, reflecting new consumer product, specialist airfreight shipments and restocking ahead of holiday period.”</p>
      <p>He said the carrier was already expecting the first half of 2020 to be “extremely challenging, financially”, but the coronavirus outbreak had exacerbated the situation.</p>
      <p>“Cathay Pacific has been through challenging times before, but the scale we are facing in the current situation really is unprecedented,” he told investors. “It is difficult to predict when these conditions will improve.</p>
      <p>“Travel demand has dropped substantially and we have taken a series of short-term measures in response. These have included a sharp reduction of capacity in our passenger network.</p>
      <p>“Despite these measures, we expect to incur a substantial loss for the first half of 2020.”</p>
      <p>While Mr Healy expects the cargo business to continue to face “headwinds”, he said the carrier was “cautiously optimistic” following the recent reduction in US-China trade tensions, and noted the airline had kept cargo capacity intact.</p>
      <p>With the coronavirus now officially a pandemic and passenger flight cancellations continuing worldwide, Cathay Pacific Cargo said on Monday it was considering using passenger jets for cargo-only flights.</p>
      <p>This follows the temporary suspension of flights between Hong Kong and Japan, with Cathay reportedly cutting passenger capacity by two-thirds across its network in March and April.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Scoot, the low-cost carrier owned by Singapore Airlines, is reportedly flying pure cargo flights to China until the end of March, with operations handled by Singapore Airlines Cargo.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Bangladesh’s top decision-making body, ECNEC, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, on Tuesday approved construction of country’s first deepsea port, in Matarbari, near Cox’s Bazar.</p>
      <p>The port, with 16-metres of water depth, will be able to accommodate 8,000 teu vessels, cutting Bangladesh’s dependence on feeder vessels that link with the transhipment hubs of Singapore, Colombo and Port Klang.</p>
      <p>Currently, its ports of Chittagong and Mongla have a maximum 9.5 metre draught and can accommodate 2,000 teu vessels.</p>
      <p>The new port will cost over $2bn, which will be funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the government of Bangladesh and the Chittagong port authority.</p>
      <p>JICA will provide some loans at 0.01% interest, and some will be charged at 0.9%. JICA’s feasibility study report found the port financially viable.</p>
      <p>Construction is expected to be completed by December 2026.</p>
      <p>In its first phase, the port will have a 460-metre container quay and a 300-metre multipurpose quay, the two facilities operated by two quay gantry cranes, one multipurpose gantry crane, six rubber-tyred gantry cranes, two reach stackers and 12 yard tractors.</p>
      <p>Government officials said the country’s cargo handling capacity would increase significantly when the port comes into operation and could become a container hub for neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>Planning minister MA Mannan explained that Bangladesh’s export-import activities were increasing year on year and established ports had little capacity to handle this growth.</p>
      <p>“As our economic activities have increased significantly, the construction of a deepsea port is now a demand of time,” he said. “It’s a big work. The port complex will change the scenario of the entire area.”</p>
      <p>Bangladesh annually exports goods worth nearly $40bn and imports nearly $60bn. The prime seaport, Chittagong, handles over 92% of seaborne cargo, and with a nominal capacity of 1.7m teu, handled 3.1m teu in 2019.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mongla port handled 57,732 teu and 500,000 tonnes of bulk cargo last year.</p>

      <p>UPS has announced that Carol Tomé (pictured above) will succeed David Abney as the company’s new chief executive.</p>
      <p>Mr Abney, currently both chief executive and chairman, will relinquish the former position on 1 June and retire from the company altogether on 30 September.</p>
      <p>However, it added that, “in order to ensure a smooth transition and successful peak season, Mr Abney will remain as a special consultant through [to] the end of 2020”.</p>
      <p>William Johnson (pictured below), currently UPS lead independent director, will become non-executive chairman on 30 September.</p>
      <p>Ms Tomé has been a member of the UPS board since 2003 and is currently chair of the audit committee. Previously she was executive vice president and chief financial officer of The Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer in the US, for 18 years.</p>
      <p>“After a rigorous selection process involving both internal and external candidates, Carol was the clear choice,” said said Mr Johnson, who also serves as chair of the UPS nominating and corporate governance committee.</p>
      <p>“Carol is one of the most respected and talented leaders in corporate America and has a proven track record of driving growth at a global organisation, maximising shareholder value, developing talent and successfully executing against strategic priorities.</p>
      <p>“She has in-depth knowledge of UPS’s business, strategy and people, and is the right executive to lead the company at this important time in its transformation,” he added.</p>
      <p>Ms Tomé said: “I look forward to working with and further developing the talented management team and the company’s 495,000 employees to deliver for our customers and shareowners. David has led a remarkable transformation at UPS and I plan to build on his success.”</p>
      <p>The transition will bring to an end a 46-year career at UPS for Mr Abney (pictured below), who was appointed chief executive in 2014 and chairman in 2016.</p>
      <p>He served as chief operating officer from 2007, overseeing logistics, sustainability, engineering and all facets of the UPS transport network, and prior to that was president of UPS International.</p>
      <p>He has been involved in a number of UPS acquisitions, including Coyote, Marken, the Fritz companies, Sonic Air, Stolica, Lynx Express and Sino-Trans in China.</p>
      <p>He began his UPS career in 1974 as a package handler in a small facility in Greenwood, Mississippi, while attending Delta State University.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: “We congratulate David on a truly exceptional career at UPS. He has undertaken bold actions to place UPS at the forefront of the transport industry and position its global network and people to capitalise on emerging trends that will carry the company well into the future.”</p>
      <p>Mr Abney added: “UPS has been one of my life’s passions and through UPS I have been able to live the American dream. I am confident in the UPS management team and their capabilities to execute our strategies in the future. This is the right time for me to pass the baton.”</p>

    <title>CMA CGM may have to sell a piece of Ceva as it faces limited liquidity options</title>

      <p>CMA CGM could be forced to sell a minority stake in Ceva Logistics, barely a year after it took over the operator, as it seeks to reduce its growing debt mountain and improve its liquidity position.</p>
      <p>As noted in this week’s Loadstar Premium, the French carrier’s reported core ebit of €1.13bn ($1.28bn) was overshadowed by its annual debt interest bill of €1.39bn.</p>
      <p>And the French carrier is now faced with increasingly limited options as it bids to reduce its debt, according to new analysis from Alphaliner today, which noted that “CMA CGM said the current bond prices would not support the issuance of new bonds and it will consider various options to improve its liquidity position”.</p>
      <p>The liner shipping analyst said the line’s options to raise cash included: “the sale of remaining unencumbered vessel and container equipment assets that are valued at about $400m; the sale of remaining 17 terminal assets that have not been sold to the China Merchants Ports joint venture; and the sale of a minority stake in CEVA Logistics”.</p>
      <p>CMA CGM currently has six bonds issued, for a combined total of $2.9bn, which are due for maturity between September this year and January 2025, while total debt to be repaid within two years amounts to $5.3bn.</p>
      <p>“Investor concerns over CMA CGM’s weak liquidity position have seen the price of the carrier’s five-year bonds drop to a low of just 61 cents on the euro, with some $1.2bn of its outstanding bonds coming due in 2020 and 2021,” Alphaliner explained.</p>
      <p>Loadstar Premium editor Alessandro Pasetti said the bond market was pricing-in a debt restructuring or possible default, but added: “We have seen CMA CGM bounce back many times with creative ideas.”</p>
      <p>The possibility of a part-sale of Ceva Logistics was mooted in an interview with CMA CGM chief financial officer Michael Sirat in Loadstar Premium last October.</p>
      <p>“Mr Sirat confirmed that CMA CGM would not retain 100% of Ceva’s equity capital, but would retain a majority stake as it was ‘actively’ looking at possible options,” it reported.</p>
      <p>According to The Loadstar sources, this could amount to as much as 40% of the unit being hived-off, although market interest has been low in recent months.</p>

      <p>With the coronavirus crisis disrupting automotive assembly lines, suppliers are increasingly looking to ad hoc airfreight for help.</p>
      <p>On-demand freight platform Cargobase has seen a 40% uptick in expedited volumes since the crisis began.</p>
      <p>“About 60% of the shippers using us are tier-1 or -2 suppliers to the car manufacturers, who usually use the platform for ‘expedites’ or tool moves. Now, they use the platform to find solutions in order to avoid potential disruptions of their manufacturing process,” said the company.</p>
      <p>Cargobase shipments to and from China have doubled, and there’s also been a “strong increase” between Europe and North America.</p>
      <p>“Large part-manufacturers are trying to share inventory globally, but also source from alternative suppliers for parts,” said Wiebe Helder, Cargobase’s chief executive.</p>
      <p>“From what we’ve heard, the situation is seriously going to affect manufacturers in the next few weeks, as they won’t receive supplies that usually come in by ocean freight. That gap might deplete their inventory, leaving them no choice but look at airfreight alternatives,” he added.</p>
      <p>In Italy, which entered a China-like lockdown this week, there has been no disruption to air cargo operations so far, according to forwarders, although many passenger flights have been cancelled.</p>
      <p>The epicentre of the outbreak in Italy is the country’s northern manufacturing heartland, where around half of all production is linked to the automotive industry. Carmakers such as BMW, Daimler, Fiat, Peugeot and Volkswagen have reportedly been able to keep assembly lines moving, using air cargo in some cases for shipments normally reserved for sea or road freight.</p>
      <p>Despite passenger flight cancellations worldwide, Cargobase saw a 55% increase in February bookings for onboard couriers, compared with January. It said the service allowed commercial shipments to be transported via carry-on or check-in baggage, therefore bypassing airport loading and collection times while remaining compliant with customs regulations.</p>
      <p>“An onboard courier service is often used out of China to expedite exports, as the time to request for permits to organise air charters can take over a week,” the company explained.</p>
      <p>Global airfreight rates have spiked due to the reduction in bellyhold capacity – The Loadstar reported yesterday that ad hoc rates are expected to reach $10 per kg.</p>
      <p>Cargobase noted a 50% increase in express airfreight “cost avoidance” – a calculation of the average quotation received, minus the booked quote.</p>
      <p>“This indicates that average quotations received have experienced a surge, possibly due to providers raising rates due to the urgent situation.”</p>
      <p>To respond to the growing demand, Cargobase has launched a new service to allow shippers to use the platform within 24 hours of signing up, instead of the usual two-week onboarding process.</p>
      <p>“More than ever, shippers have an urgent need to know what they are spending on freight caused by the disruption. For some, it is to make business decisions, and for others it is to claim back cost  to suppliers or customers,” said Mr Helder.</p>
      <p>“These are the times that the volume of emails increases significantly and people lose track of what is going on, while management still needs full transparency. Our platform helps with that.”</p>

      <p>OOCL says it will be able to run a standalone Asia-North Europe loop following the delivery of five 23,000 teu newbuilds in 2023.</p>
      <p>Parent Orient Overseas (International) Ltd (OOIL), a subsidiary of Cosco Shipping, said it had entered into “arm’s length” commercial newbuild contracts with state-owned Cosco shipyards, Nantong Cosco KHI Ship Engineering for two vessels and Dalian Cosco for three, at $156m per unit.</p>
      <p>“Based on the group’s evaluation on price, technical terms and delivery schedule, the Nantong and Dalian offers were the best among bidders,” said OOIL.</p>
      <p>There would likely have been no shortage of bidders, given that the containership orderbook-to-fleet ratio is at its lowest since the 1980s.</p>
      <p>However, the South Korean yards and others would have been stretched to compete with the subsidised China state-owned yards and the flexible financing programmes provided by domestic banks.</p>
      <p>OOIL said it envisaged bank financing to be arranged “for about 60% of the contract price of each vessel”, with the balance “funded from internal resources”.</p>
      <p>The company explained: “These five new buildings are part of our ongoing programme to introduce large, modern, and fuel-efficient vessels to further strengthen our fleet competitiveness, as well as fleet rebalancing, by increasing the proportion of the ships we own in the core fleet, while a number of vessels leased under long-term charters will be returned to the owners.”</p>
      <p>The carrier currently owns six 21,000 teu ULCVs deployed on the Asia-North Europe route, which was the “first step” in expansion plans postponed by the “terrible market conditions of 2016”, and which subsequently resulted in a $6.3bn deal for Cosco to acquire OOIL in 2017.</p>
      <p>It said the announcement of the mega-ship order was the “long-awaited second step” of the strategic plan.</p>
      <p>“We will have the potential to independently form a complete loop in the Asia-Europe trade, where we intend to deploy them in order to strengthen OOCL’s overall competitive position in the market and improve services to customers.</p>
      <p>“Balancing this expansion, over the next five years we plan to return or dispose of 13 vessels from our fleet, a total of around 76,000 teu.”</p>
      <p>Currently, OOCL partners with parent Cosco, CMA CGM and Evergreen in the Ocean Alliance, which was extended last year to run until 2027.</p>
      <p>However, the Cosco group could be keeping its longer-term options open in the case of a further reshuffling of alliance membership, should there be another liner bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>OOCL said the new vessels would “help to bring economies of scale to OOCL’s unit cost structure”.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to say that the latest engine technology and other state-of-the-art equipment will be used to achieve greater operational efficiency and reduce carbon emission,” said the carrier.</p>
      <p>There was however no mention of the newbuild ships having scrubbers installed.</p>
      <p>The cost advantages of the exhaust gas cleaning systems have become much less attractive, given the spread between compliant low-sulphur fuel and heavy fuel oil, used by scrubber-fitted ships, has fallen to $80 per ton, from the approximate $250 difference when the IMO regulations came into force on 1 January.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Evofenedex, the Dutch trade and logistics association, has urged its government to scrap its proposed ‘environmental’ air cargo tax, which it claims could “kill air freight facilities” in the country.</p>
      <p>The government has opted for a tax on the maximum take-off weight, penalising larger aircraft, which, Evofenedex pointed out, hits particularly hard newer and cleaner aircraft.</p>
      <p>The group also pointed out that the tax would lead to “leakage” and therefore not the revenue the government was hoping for.</p>
      <p>“The tax alone will kill the air freight facilities at Maastricht Airport,” said chairman Steven Lak.</p>
      <p>“In addition, the council of state has already expressed great concern about the leakage effect of cargo flights to foreign airports as a result of this measure and its impact on our business climate and prosperity.</p>
      <p>“The spread of the coronavirus forces the aviation sector to cancel many flights. As a result, we are now close to a knockout for a large part of the air cargo facilities in the Netherlands. ”</p>
      <p>The Dutch government is expecting to raise some €200m ($227m) through the tax, which is designed, claims Evofenedex, to close a budget gap, rather than helping make aviation more sustainable. Cargo’s portion will be €12m.</p>
      <p>“Due to the levy, many cargo flights will be relocated abroad, where there is no levy on freight aircraft. Because the total revenue is based on the number of flights with freight aircraft in the Netherlands, and the leakage effect is not taken into account, the revenue for the treasury will simply be lower,” said the association.</p>
      <p>Evofenedex is arguing instead for a European variant of the tax, under the Green Deal.</p>
      <p>“The EU variant maintains a level playing field, stimulates innovation and does make air freight more sustainable. And that is smarter,” said Mr Lak.</p>
      <p>“We don’t get it. The levy slows the sustainability of air freight shipments, possibly curbs the air freight market and provides the government with less financial means than it thinks. This should therefore be smarter.”</p>
