      <p>Pallet users should pay a tax, according to one senior freight forwarder.</p>
      <p>In a wide-ranging speech at the Logistics CIO Europe conference in Amsterdam this morning, Steve Walker, head of consultancy SWG and founder of SBS Worldwide, bought out by DSV in 2013, urged the industry to consider a charitable tax.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to talk a little bit about carbon footprints, and the negative publicity we get for creating, supposedly, 3% of the world’s pollution by transport. Yet we never seem to fight back with any major initiatives – certainly not on a collective basis.</p>
      <p>“We should say we will no longer move pallets by ocean for free; we will implement a pallet levy of $5 per pallet come 2021. If all containers had 20 pallets, the pallet levy would yield $1.8m per large vessel.</p>
      <p>“Consider if you multiply that for the number of vessels arriving every week in Europe, will the customers want to pay it? No, but maybe the public will buy into it, and governments will give companies tax offsets.</p>
      <p>“We can undertake, as an industry, to contribute the majority of fees to marine charities to clean up the oceans, of which we, the human race, have made such a mess.”</p>
      <p>While pallets are generally considered re-usable and recyclable, he said, “let’s be honest – it’s not recycled as you and I would expect. They don’t have a very long shelf life, they slowly downgrade until they become something like wooden pellets for burning”.</p>
      <p>He added: “And there is a further consideration: wooden pallets should not have their own carbon footprint due to their weight.”</p>
      <p>The combined carbon impact of pallets on the emissions of a UCLV is illustrated in the diagram below.</p>
      <p>Mr Walker also urged the industry to come up with a better solution, which could be expedited by the proposed tax. He said he had given a talk to young freight forwarders in the UK who, he said, were “incredulous that four-way pallets had been around for 80 years and we hadn’t had the ability to think of a more modern way of moving goods in and out of containers.</p>
      <p>“When I first started in freight forwarding, vessels used to come into the port of London and the hatches would go back. The cargo would be removed from the hold and there were minimal supporting packaging materials.</p>
      <p>“The whole point of containers is to move freight. So I suggest we need to evaluate that one small thin column on a bill of lading, that has stayed the same for my near-50 year career, where it states packaging.”</p>
      <p>Mr Walker added that the industry should have a positive message about emissions: “When we are only delivering what the world has ordered in a take, make, consume and dispose society”.</p>

      <p>While Europe and North America begin to grapple with the alarming spread of coronavirus cases, shipping activity in China appears to be picking up, according to new data from liner consultancy SeaIntelligence.</p>
      <p>It says there is now a clear reduction in the number of announced blank sailings by carriers as trucking operations resume in China, leading to increased export cargo arriving at ports and ships are needed to handle the backlog of containers.</p>
      <p>“The weekly measurement of carriers’ blank sailings out of China show the coronavirus impact is now subsiding rapidly,” said SeaIntelligence chief executive Alan Murphy.</p>
      <p>“The bulk of the blank sailings were announced during weeks seven and eight; weeks nine and ten have seen a clear tapering off, and the level of new announcements of blank sailings is back to normal.</p>
      <p>“This means carriers are seeing demand ramping back up to normal levels over the next few weeks,” he added.</p>
      <p>However, while that might offer some relief to Chinese exporters and their international buyers, the knock-on effect from the unprecedented number of blanked sailings from Asia since Chinese New Year is seriously hitting Europe’s container ports, feeder services, barge operators and trucking.</p>
      <p>According to Sea-Intelligence data from last week, the number of Asia-Europe blanked sailings had reached 46, of which 29 were directly attributable to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
      <p>And there are reports that many of the vessels that did sail from China are arriving less than half-full at their first port of discharge in Europe. One UK terminal operations manager told The Loadstar he had “struggled to keep up” with the number of vessel deletions.</p>
      <p>“That also means that the feeders are dropping off as well, as there is no point in them calling if there is nothing to tranship,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt that our throughput numbers for the first quarter will be significantly down in the first quarter, but hopefully we will see the anticipated v-shaped recovery in Q2 and Q3 that will go some way to repairing the volume damage,” he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the feeder operators are having to survive on ad hoc “scraps” in the absence of the normal relay requirements. One north European feeder source told The Loadstar it had cancelled calls “left, right and centre”, as the containers “were just not there”.</p>
      <p>Like their ocean carrier customers, feeder operators are able to save port costs and fuel during weak demand periods, but still remain responsible for ship charter hire payments, unless they are able to redeliver the redundant vessels back to owners.</p>
      <p>The dramatic slump in imports due to lack of demand for the haulage sector has been “brutal”, according to a Felixstowe-based operator.</p>
      <p>“We have had to lay off some of our drivers, as business is just not there at the moment,” he told The Loadstar.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the impact of the cancelled ships from Asia is being felt right across the industry service sectors, from port agents to customs brokers and warehousing.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, European and North American exporters to Asia are likely to continue to see far higher-than-average freight rates as container supply chain bottlenecks continue to shift.</p>
      <p>“Back haul freight rates are beginning to increase as carriers increasingly favour empty repositioning for the limited back haul sailings,” said Mr Murphy. “This is in order to get into position to capture what is expected to be a peak in Chinese exports in the medium-term future. It could well be expected that back haul rates will be pushed even higher.”</p>
      <p>This appears to be particularly acute for Europe-Asia shippers, where 20ft containers remain heavily in demand – CMA CGM on Friday announced a peak season surcharge of $200 per teu and $400 per feu on shipments from morthern Europe to the Indian subcontinent from 15 March; and Maersk similarly announced a peak season surcharge of the same level on shipments from southern Europe to Asia from 16 March.</p>
      <p>There appears to be one sliver lining for both carriers and customers, however: sharply declining fuel prices look set to remove issues around the IMO low-sulphur rules, at least temporarily.</p>
      <p>“Two months ago, IMO 2020 was set to be the carriers’ major problematic issue. Today, low-sulphur fuel prices are dipping below the levels of normal fuel last year.</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, the sudden price war on oil has the potential to send fuel prices back to levels seen in 2015/16, and hence make the cost of low-sulphur fuel the least of the carriers’ problems,” Mr Murphy said.</p>

      <p>Forwarders are anticipating ad hoc air freight rates of $10 per kg, as shippers become desperate to release goods from China with little or no belly capacity.</p>
      <p>One Chinese forwarder said he expected a 777 or 747 aircraft to soon cost $1m, or $10 per kg, and spot rates have already increased twice in the past couple of days, by Rmb10 ($1.43) or more per kg to Europe.</p>
      <p>“We do expect a possible third increase towards the weekend,” he added.</p>
      <p>He said there were some charter possibilities, with carriers such as  SF Airlines, AirBridgeCargo and China Southern, but he said airlines would not hold the rate, and were quoting for each shipment on each flight, at a rate which could change before the cargo even got on the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Despite having a shipment confirmed last week, overnight the forwarder was told to pay an additional Rmb6 per kg if he wanted it uplifted on schedule.</p>
      <p>“We can only take cargo from those customers who understand the tricky situation that everything is beyond our control, basically.”</p>
      <p>He added that airlines were looking for full chargeable weight and that volumetric cargo was “not a priority” for airlines.</p>
      <p>One European forwarder added that rates today were already some $6 or $7 per kg: a “global phenomenon”.</p>
      <p>He added: “Demand is through the roof. And supply is not increasing as carriers, if anything, are reducing further the scheduled passenger flights from Chinese gateways, especially in the north, around Beijing.</p>
      <p>“The market is going very much one way – I reckon rates could hit $10 per kg by the end of the week.”</p>
      <p>The news will have investors – and the market – asking why Atlas Air has not returned its four parked freighters to operations.</p>
      <p>In its earnings call on 20 February, chief executive John Dietich said: “The demand has not been there for those aircraft, so we elected for the 747 converted freighters to be temporarily parked.”  In response to investor questions, he added that the lead time to get at least one aircraft back was as little as one week.</p>
      <p>“It could range anywhere from a week to 45 days, depending on the status of the aircraft, depending on the status of the engines, when it’s due for certain maintenance. There is no single answer to that, but there are a couple of aircraft that we would hold out that could move pretty quickly back online if we need them, and probably the other two, a little bit more lead time in that 30 to 45-day time period.”</p>
      <p>Atlas Air told The Loadstar it “had no comment at this time” on the freighters, but none of the four appears to have been brought back into operations, according to flight tracking websites. Pilots indicated on social media that Atlas did not have the crew to operate them, although this has not been confirmed.</p>
      <p>It could, of course, be that bringing back the freighters will take too long, or be prohibitively expensive – although it could be argued that there could not possibly be a better time to return them to service.</p>
      <p>The European forwarded noted that, while at the moment demand is “exceeding supply massively”, this could change.</p>
      <p>“The market may slow if the world goes into isolation and people stop shopping. If there aren’t shoppers, then there isn’t demand, and supply becomes balanced.”</p>
      <p>Intra-Asia sea freight, meanwhile, is “all OK”, with no issues on capacity or departures. The current demand for intra-Asian lanes is for manufacturing parts going to South-east Asia, but that is expected to cool through the month.</p>

      <p>A new report claims the Chinese government is using forced labour at factories, “tainting” global supply chains.</p>
      <p>The Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s (ASPI) Uyghurs for sale report alleges a “mass transfer” of ethic minority citizens from the north-west autonomous region of Xinjiang under conditions which “strongly suggest” forced labour.</p>
      <p>“Uyghurs are working in factories in the supply chains of at least 83 well known global brands in the technology, clothing and automotive sectors, including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei, Nike, Samsung, Sony and Volkswagen,” claims the report.</p>
      <p>China’s Uyghur ethnic minority has long been the subject of a government “re-education” programme, with up to a million people in internment camps in Xinjiang, with claims of human rights abuse, including using the camps as manufacturing facilities linked to global food, apparel, and hi-tech supply chains.</p>
      <p>And ASPI claims forced labour is not limited to Xinjiang and estimates “more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred from there to work in factories across China between 2017 and 2019” – some “sent directly from detention camps.”</p>
      <p>ASPI claims it has exposed a new phase in China’s ‘social re-engineering’ campaign targeting minority citizens: “a state-sponsored labour transfer scheme that is tainting the global supply chain”.</p>
      <p>The report highlights three examples of Uyghur workers who “appear to be” employed under forced labour conditions in factories which supply global brands, including a facility “equipped with watchtowers, barbed-wire fences and police guard boxes” in eastern China that manufactures shoes for Nike.</p>
      <p>The claims pose new reputation and legal risks for companies and consumers purchasing goods from China, as products “made in any part of the country, not just in Xinjiang”, may have passed through the hands of forced labourers, ASPI said.</p>
      <p>According to local media, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has refuted ASPI’s claims. The state-owned Global Times quotes local officials as saying the report was a “nefarious campaign that the west has launched to smear China, and another cock and bull story”.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, ZDNet reports claims by numerous technology firms named in the report that there was no evidence of forced labour in their supply chains, while Chinese telecoms giant Huawei attacked ASPI’s funding.</p>
      <p>It said: “The plain fact of the matter is that ASPI is currently registered on the Foreign Influence Transparency list, due to the fact it receives huge amounts of its funding from the United States government, and it also receives funding from a large number of US weapons manufacturers.”</p>

      <p>Shareholders suing FedEx have a “doomed” case, according to a recent court filing by FedEx management.</p>
      <p>A group of shareholders last year filed a case claiming FedEx executives had failed to disclose to investors the true problems at TNT following the NotPetya cyber attack, but had continued to trade shares themselves.</p>
      <p>However, in its response, FedEx claimed the shareholders had failed to demonstrate “a suspicious pattern of trades”, and said each director, in fact, had increased or maintained their shareholdings during the timeframe in the filing.</p>
      <p>It added: “Most critically, the complaint fails to make any particularised allegations about the knowledge or actions of any of the eleven outside directors. That omission dooms their case.”</p>
      <p>FedEx also argued that the allegations were “highly misleading” and omitted “numerous disclosures that informed investors about the effects of the cyber attack and FedEx’s recovery efforts”.</p>
      <p>As an example, FedEx noted that in its quarterly report dated 20 December 2017, it had disclosed that “not all customers are shipping at pre-attack volume levels”.</p>
      <p>The report also states: “TNT Express experienced a significant cyber attack in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the ongoing impact could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition in the future, particularly if our continuing recovery efforts do not proceed as expected.”</p>
      <p>Similarly, in its quarterly report dated 21 March 2018, FedEx says it disclosed “loss of revenue due to decreased shipments in the TNT network”, “incremental costs to restore information technology systems” and “lingering revenue impacts”.</p>
      <p>It also reveals that there is an “exculpatory provision in FedEx’s certificate of incorporation that immunises the directors from monetary liability for breaches of the duty of care”.</p>
      <p>The filing adds: “But FedEx never represented that it had not lost customers due to the cyber attack; to the contrary, the company disclosed that its efforts to restore the TNT customer base (and associated volumes) to pre-attack levels was ongoing.”</p>
      <p>The case continues.</p>

      <p>DP-DHL has confirmed its 2019 earnings, which hit €63.6bn ($72.4bn), with operating profit up 30% to €4.1bn.</p>
      <p>Global Forwarding, Freight, saw a 1% increase in revenue to €15.1bn, with operating profit up nearly 18% to €521m.</p>
      <p>“With an ebit plus of 18%, the division demonstrated a remarkable performance,” said CEO Frank Appel, “despite the fact that the global air freight market actually weakened substantially in the second half of the year due to a weaker global economy.</p>
      <p>“We were able to hold our market share in this difficult environment. At the same time, we were much more cost-efficient – thanks to the continued roll-out of our new IT systems, among other things.</p>
      <p>“We are thereby gradually laying the foundation for raising the profitability of the forwarding and freight business to a competitive level in the medium term, as planned.”</p>
      <p>This division, however, along with Express, is expected to be hardest hit by coronavirus, due to “the reductions in cross-border trade”.</p>
      <p>Mr Appel added, however: “If the situation returns to normal quickly, we could still make up the deficit over the course of the year … our employees are familiar in dealing with crises such as supply chain disruptions. Therefore, the situation could yield positive effects for us. What’s more, our fundamental growth drivers are sound – above all, the global boom in e-commerce.”</p>
      <p>The Express division boosted revenue by 5.9% to €17.1bn, driven by the international time-definite delivery business, which saw daily shipment volumes rise 5.7%. Operating profit grew 4.2% to €2bn, due to “strict yield management and continuous improvements in the network”. The operating margin was 11.9%.</p>
      <p>Supply Chain saw a marginal increase in revenue, up 0.6% to €13.4bn – “despite the sale of its Chinese business to SF Holding” in the first quarter of last year. It did however see new and existing business increase €1.2bn and operating profit rose from €520m to €912m – mainly as a result of one-time effects from the SF Holding deal, which contributed €426m to ebit. The division invested that mostly into restructuring its UK business. After adjusting for one-time effects, Supply Chain reported an operating margin of 4.7%.</p>
      <p>The group’s new eCommerce division increased revenue by 5.5% to €4bn, but restructuring measures, costing €80m, had a “negative impact on operating profit”, at €51m. eCommerce Solutions is expected to contribute between €50m and €100m to ebit this year.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to our broad geographic set-up and our comprehensive portfolio, we are in a very robust position and more resilient than other companies in our sector,” said Mr Appel.</p>
      <p>“Of course, we cannot disconnect completely from the global economy. We will not remain entirely unaffected by this worldwide crisis. However, it is currently much too early to judge its financial impact.</p>
      <p>“In spite of this, we are forging ahead with our Strategy 2025 and putting the company on track to continue our profitable growth in 2020 and beyond.”</p>

    <content>
      <p>The Digital Container Shipping Association (UDCSA) today published its guidelines for the box shipping sector to comply with the forthcoming International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) anti-cyber crime legislation.</p>
      <p>The IMO’s Resolution MSC.428(98) on Maritime Cyber Risk Management in Safety Management Systems is set to become law in January next year, and the new DCSA publication “provides all shipping companies with a common language and a manageable, task-based approach for meeting the IMO’s implementation timeframe”.</p>
      <p>Shipowner association BIMCO and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed cyber risk management frameworks that enable shipowners to “effectively incorporate cyber risk management into their existing safety management systems”, and the DCSA advice today helps the container shipping sector align with those frameworks.</p>
      <p>“We have worked with BIMCO on this, and this is something that not only our nine members will benefit, but the entire industry,” DCSA chief executive Thomas Bagge told The Loadstar last week.</p>
      <p>“As shipping catches up with other industries, such as banking and telcoms, in terms of digitisation, the need for cyber risk management becomes an imperative.</p>
      <p>“Due to the global economic dependence on shipping and the complex interconnectedness of shipping logistics, cyber attacks, such as malware, denial of service and system hacks, cannot only disrupt one carrier’s revenue stream, they can have a significant impact on the global economy,” he added today.</p>
      <p>The DCSA implementation guide breaks down the BIMCO framework into themes and maps these themes to the controls that underpin the NIST functional elements: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.</p>
      <p>The organisation said that by following its guidance, vessel owners would have “a catalogue of cyber security safeguards aligned with each vulnerability identified during risk assessment, together with notes explaining any residual risk”.</p>
      <p>Jakob Larsen, head of maritime safety &amp; security at BIMCO, explained: “The DCSA implementation guidance provides a thorough and refreshing deep dive into the challenge of how to implement cyber risk management in a shipowner company.</p>
      <p>“Initially thought of as a tool for container carriers, the guidance can also inspire the thinking in other shipping sectors as well as the ongoing update of the major shipping associations’ benchmark document Guidelines on Cyber Risk Management Onboard Ships.”</p>

      <p>More passenger flight suspensions have created a capacity crunch for intra-Asia air cargo, and as freight rates skyrocket airlines consider using passenger aircraft for cargo-only services.</p>
      <p>Due to the coronavirus and new travel restrictions, Cathay Pacific announced today the temporary withdrawal of passenger flights between Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan – the latest in a long list of suspensions that led the carrier to ground half its fleet.</p>
      <p>Flights between Hong Kong and Fukuoka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Tokyo, and Osaka are affected; as well as those between Taipei and Tokyo and Osaka.</p>
      <p>“Although we expect our passenger belly cargo operations to be impacted, we are evaluating how to continue serving our cargo customers to and from Japan,” Cathay said.</p>
      <p>“This includes the retention of certain passenger services for cargo carriage only.”</p>
      <p>Rickard Ingvarsson, Asia chief executive and global head of airfreight at Scan Global Logistics (SGL), said freight rates within Asia were “extremely volatile” because of the airline capacity adjustments.</p>
      <p>He told The Loadstar: “Intra-Asia has been heavily impacted with travel bans and restrictions, leading to capacity cuts of between 50% and 70%. As a result, rates are going up a few hundred percent overnight.</p>
      <p>“Hi-tech, pharma, retail, automotive and e-commerce are the most affected, and another critical challenge is the lack of raw materials for factories in South-east Asia.”</p>
      <p>Capacity out of China is still very scarce, Mr Ingvarsson added, with up to 70% fewer flights operating since the virus outbreak on the biggest tradelanes of intra-Asia, Europe and US.</p>
      <p>“About 5,000 tons, or equivalent to 50 747Fs of daily capacity has been pulled, creating a shortage of supply and a spike in airfreight rates on most destinations.</p>
      <p>“Some of the larger commercial carriers have pushed back the resume date to end of April, due to the further spread of Covid-19 virus.”</p>
      <p>While freighters have been operating throughout the crisis, mostly carrying medical aid and supplies into China, they only recently started exporting goods on return flights to US and Europe, according to Mr Ingvarsson.</p>
      <p>“Although factory workers and factories have resumed worked, they are still running at low pace, hence peak times are expected to happen in coming weeks, should there be no shortage of raw materials – which is another big concern,” he explained.</p>
      <p>SGL expects the volatile market of high freight rates and lengthy waiting times for cargo out of China to continue until next month. Therefore, the forwarder is recommending alternative transport routes.</p>
      <p>“We suggest customers consider ocean freight, rail freight, sea-air freight and even road freight, such as China-ASEAN cross-border trucks to diversify the risk.</p>
      <p>“It is anticipated that surging demand of rail freight will also drive rate increases. In the meantime, more and more charter flight services will be launched in the market to soften demand,” said Mr Ingvarsson.</p>

    <title>CMA CGM liftings up in 2019, but new rules and Ceva loss wipe out profits</title>

    <content>
      <p>CMA CGM has posted a net loss of $229m for 2019 – this compares with a profit of $34m the year before.</p>
      <p>The French transport group’s result was dragged down by the $329m negative impact of new accounting rules on vessel time charters and a $140m loss by Ceva Logistics.</p>
      <p>However, CMA CGM remains bullish about its liner trade outlook and its ability to turn around the loss-making logistics arm, despite the adverse effect of the coronavirus outbreak on Chinese exports.</p>
      <p>Turnover at the group soared 29% on the previous year, to $30.3bn, boosted by $7.1bn in revenue from Ceva.</p>
      <p>Container liftings on its fleet of 502 vessels increased by an above-industry par of 4.1%, to 21.6m teu, which CMA CGM attributed to growth in its shortsea business, “strong growth” in intra-Asia and “organic growth” in the African and Latin American trades.</p>
      <p>“After an extremely robust January, the early part of the year has been marked by the Covid-19 crisis,” it said, and added: “There has been an upturn in volumes, and a major catch-up effect is expected once the health situation stabilises, as western countries will be seeking to rebuild their inventories”.</p>
      <p>CMA CGM said it expected to return to “normal capacity as of mid-March” out of China, as it reactivates its network following the crisis.</p>
      <p>Chairman and chief executive Rodolphe Saade tweeted: “I observe an upturn of the economic activity in China; 80% of the manufacturing units are again operational. And every day, more open. We are anticipating a rebound in volumes related to restocking.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Ocean Alliance has reinstated some blanked sailings this month, after an earlier-than-expected recovery in manufacturing and trucking. A carrier source told The Loadstar last week it had been “pleasantly surprised” by the firm booking forecasts for the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>“Cargo is coming back onstream much earlier than we had expected in China, so we will be rehashing the number of loaders for the second half of March,” he said.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, CMA CGM and its peers have lost millions in top line revenue due to the Covid-19 restrictions which followed Chinese New Year and, even assuming pent up demand provides a liftings boost in the second quarter, they could find it a challenge to recover from Q1’s financial hit.</p>
      <p>Moreover, with the cashflow tap having been turned right down for several weeks, carriers without the benefit of deep pockets could become financially stressed in the coming months as they continue to be responsible for charter hire on their ships, along with their other usual fixed costs.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, CMA CGM is persevering with its goal of turning the Ceva acquisition from a negative asset to a positive for the group.</p>
      <p>In its “second-phase turnaround plan” for the logistics business, it said it was “pursuing its strategic transformation plan, aimed at delivering strong revenue growth combined with a significant improvement in its profitability”.</p>

    <content>
      <p>As XPO Logistics continues to ponder options to sell parts of its own business, it has returned to the acquisition trail with an agreement to buy part of Kuehne + Nagel’s contract logistics trade in the UK.</p>
      <p>This morning K+N announced it had entered into a “definitive agreement” to sell the drinks logistics, food services and retail &amp; technology vertical in its UK contract logistics division, part of wide-ranging review of the Switzerland-headquartered freight forwarder’s operations.</p>
      <p>Although both parties declined to disclose the purchase prices, K+N did say the operations concerned “generated a turnover of approximately Sfr750m ($808m) in 2019 and are supported by 7,500 employees”.</p>
      <p>Detlef Trefzger, K+N chief executive, explained: “One year ago, we first announced the strategic review of our contract logistics business to improve profitability and focus on our core, scalable solutions. We have now reached a major milestone in this effort, having secured an agreement to sell significant non-core assets in the UK.</p>
      <p>“With XPO Logistics, we are pleased to have found a good new home for our customers and employees.”</p>
      <p>However, KN claimed it “remains highly committed to excellent customer solutions and service in the UK across all business units, including contract logistics.</p>
      <p>“In particular, the company retains the industry verticals aerospace, government and pharma. These are among the group’s scalable leverage areas.” it said.</p>
      <p>The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including merger clearance by the competent competition authorities and is expected to close in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>In a separate development, XPO Logistics’ UK arm announced last week it had signed a new “long-term partnership agreement with Mercedes-Benz Parts Logistics to manage UK parts distribution”.</p>
      <p>The contract will see XPO distributing automotive parts to Mercedes-Benz’s UK retail and commercial vehicle dealerships, operating more than 40 daily routes from the manufacturer’s European Logistics Centre in Milton Keynes to XPO’s overnight-delivery depots across the UK. Part of the deal will see XPO acquire 42 new Mercedes-Benz Actros trucks dedicated to serving the contract.</p>
      <p>Juan Manuel Santiago Mendez, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Parts Logistics in the UK, said: “Our UK operation keeps consumers and businesses moving – it is responsible for more than 750,000 part numbers.</p>
      <p>“We believe XPO has the scale, capabilities and expertise required to support our retailers and dealers with reliable distribution. They have designed a comprehensive solution to our high standards, and their technology should enhance network visibility.”</p>

      <p>The most-up-to-date and reliable capacity utilisation data for air cargo is to be shared with Tiaca members as part of the association’s strategy to add value to their businesses.</p>
      <p>Clive Data Services has signed an agreement with Tiaca to provide market data for the association’s Cargo Pulse newsletter, as well as regular market trends content for social media, and speakers at the association’s conferences.</p>
      <p>Clive’s data centres on its weekly ‘dynamic load factor’ analysis, which offers a more realistic analysis of the utilisation of aircraft than has traditionally been available.</p>
      <p>Tiaca has recently approached its members, via a survey, to find out how it could add value to the membership. Members called for more education on air cargo economics and access to more market-driven data.</p>
      <p>“As part of the transformation of Tiaca, we are promising to deliver more content to our growing membership, but only content of value to their businesses and which accurately represents and promotes the global air cargo industry,” explained chairman Steven Polmans.</p>
      <p>“Clive’s dynamic load factor is registering a lot of interest, because it breaks with tradition and is changing the way air cargo usage is measured, based on the realities of today’s market. It is also the fastest source of data, which is also very appealing for our members.”</p>
      <p>Niall van de Wouw, managing director of Clive, said: “Working with Tiaca enables us to put our market intelligence in front of a large group of respected decision-makers, who we hope will embrace our new load factor methodology. This represents another important step forward in getting the industry to accept there is a new and more accurate way to measure how full flights are.”</p>
      <p>The Clive data, collated from a large and representative group of airlines around the world, bases its load factor on both volume and weight, as well as capacity available. By processing the data weekly, the industry can see trends in almost real time, rather than the broad sketch provided by monthly data, which fails to reveal trends in detail.</p>
      <p>Members will receive their first market analysis from Clive this month.</p>

    <title>Demand-sensing software: 'if UPS is using it, there must be something to it'</title>

    <content>
      <p>UPS is in the process of fine-tuning its management of deliveries by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to inject more live data into its operations.</p>
      <p>At the end of January the integrator began the roll-out of its On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation platform, which gives drivers the most efficient routings, recalculating individual package delivery routes throughout the day, taking in changes in traffic conditions, pick-up commitments and delivery orders.</p>
      <p>In addition to more accurate delivery time estimates, it will enable new products and services that require higher levels of accuracy, reliability and responsiveness, according to UPS, and the enhanced routing tool will further reduce miles driven, fuel consumed and carbon emissions.</p>
      <p>The dynamic platform uses advanced algorithms, AI and machine learning.</p>
      <p>Some shippers have already begun to use AI and machine learning for forward-looking computations. Faced with uncertainty, shortening product cycles and rapidly changing consumption trends, they are trying to respond to new trends by using demand-sensing tools.</p>
      <p>According to ToolsGroup, a provider of supply chain planning tools software, demand-sensing “closes the gap between your plan and what’s actually happening in your supply chain”, by spotting changes and patterns in downstream activities.</p>
      <p>Going beyond historical data, using IT to detect trends can significantly improve forecasting accuracy, ToolsGroup claims. This can help manufacturers adjust production output and improve inventory management.</p>
      <p>One customer, Amplifon, a provider of hearing solutions, has seen an 18% reduction of inventory and cut obsolescence by 50%, according to the software firm.</p>
      <p>“Demand-sensing is proven to help our customers cut short-term forecast error by up to 50% and raise inventory performance by up to 20%, while hitting or exceeding target service levels,” ToolsGroup claimed.</p>
      <p>Hybrid demand-sensing systems use multiple forecasting techniques and data types, which range from promotional campaigns and competitors’ activities to updated sales figures, weather forecasts and social media sentiment.</p>
      <p>Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder and head analyst of Logistics Trends &amp; Insights, said bots which feed off social media could enter ample data into the system. UPS employs bots for its help desk and customer services, and all the data handled by these are fed into the system, she added.</p>
      <p>POS data are highly prized for demand-sensing, but it is possible to go ahead without it, according to E2 Open, a provider of intelligent applications, which argues that all that is needed to get started is the demand forecast and data on orders and shipments.</p>
      <p>“More than three-quarters of demand-sensing implementations use just these three internal signals, and on average they achieve a 40% reduction in forecast error,” claims E2 Open on its website.</p>
      <p>It stresses that demand-sensing does not bring about a fundamental change in operations, or replace longer-term forecasts, but improves visibility and provides a more granular view. Hence, it can also be applied to long-term forecasting.</p>
      <p>Air Canada Cargo applied AI to examine patterns of booking cancellations and changes in the final week prior to a flight’s departure, and found that cancellations and reductions in booked volume occur within that period at 60% of the rate of bookings. Adjusting for this can improve load factors by 6-8%.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, much of the communication about demand-sensing is emanating from software providers. Shippers and logistics firms have been less vocal about their trials. This suggests that, at this point, there is still more hype than action – much of it probably fuelled by the fact that a lot of venture capital is looking for investment opportunities in logistics technology.</p>
      <p>Ms Roberson says there is much venture capital circling over logistics, but the fact that UPS is moving forward with its use of AI indicates that the concept is gaining traction.</p>
      <p>“If UPS is using it, there must be something to it. It is a conservative company,” she said.</p>

      <p>Ocean carriers are preparing for a return to fully booked ships.</p>
      <p>The recovery in China’s manufacturing is reported to be up to around 80% of pre-new year levels, and regional transport movements are also getting back up to speed, it seems.</p>
      <p>“We have seen many terminals and depots returning to normal operations,” said OOCL. “The reefer plug shortage issue in Shanghai, Tianjin and Ningbo has also gradually improved and more trucking services have resumed.”</p>
      <p>The carrier’s view was supported by online freight marketplace Freightos, which reported this week that manufacturing in China had taken “definite steps” towards normality.</p>
      <p>And on the intermodal situation, Freightos said: “Inter-province trucking, which last week was a major pain point, is now operating at about 80% capacity as well.”</p>
      <p>The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) commentary this week reported vessel utilisation levels of 75%-80% for Europe and around 70% for US sailings.</p>
      <p>Carriers have been obliged to withdraw almost half of scheduled capacity on both the Asia-Europe and transpacific tradelanes since the Chinese new year on 25 January, which analyst Sea-Intelligence estimates at some 1.9m teu.</p>
      <p>This radical action could have cost the container lines around $2bn in lost revenue, according to the analyst, although carriers appeared to have succeeded in protecting spot rates from any serious erosion during the worst of the virus crisis.</p>
      <p>In fact, the North Europe component of today’s SCFI recorded a 3.2% uplift, to $830 per teu, while for Mediterranean ports, there was a slight decline of 1.4%, to $915 per teu.</p>
      <p>Carriers are in the process of preparing to raise FAK rates later in the month, as they look to recover severe losses incurred in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>The knock-on effect of the blanked sailings from China has caused a major problem for Europe’s exporters. Firstly, shippers with cargo already delivered to container terminals are having to wait weeks before loading, and secondly, acute equipment shortages at depots, caused by the absence of import cargo box returns, has resulted in some carriers refusing bookings altogether.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, The Loadstar has seen wave after wave of North Europe-Asia ‘peak season surcharge’ (PSS)  announcements from carriers in the past two weeks, which has driven a spot rate spike of 24% in the past week, to $786 per 40ft, according to Drewry’s WCI index.</p>
      <p>“Not only can we not make any bookings due to our carriers rationing equipment, but when we eventually do, who knows what the PSS will be,” said one UK forwarder.</p>
      <p>And Flexport’s head of ocean freight for Europe, Martin Holst-Mikkelsen, told The Loadstar storms hitting North Europe last month had also contributed to export delays.</p>
      <p>“The stormy weather led to a growing backlog of containers waiting to be exported at sea terminals, prompting the introduction of restricted delivery slots,” said Mr Holst-Mikkelsen.</p>
      <p>On the transpacific, spot rates as recorded by the SCFI were virtually unchanged this week for US east coast ports, at $2,679 per 40ft, while for the west coast, rates edged down 2.4% to $1,361 per 40ft.</p>
      <p>“Rate increases announced for 1 April show carriers expect a slow March, followed by a strong April and beyond,” said Freightos.</p>

      <p>Omnichannel is a word more often associated with high street retailing than air cargo, but it’s becoming a reality for airlines as options for distribution take off.</p>
      <p>Booking platforms, carrier websites and, of course, the traditional phone call all feature in the buying, selling and distribution of capacity – but the lines are blurring.</p>
      <p>ECS Group, a large GSSA, is launching a booking platform for its Total Cargo Management customers – airlines which outsource cargo in its entirety.</p>
      <p>“We are going further,” said chief executive Adrien Thominet. “We were just doing operations, but we can do so much more, and are intending to develop a web platform with business intelligence.”</p>
      <p>He said GSSAs could be at risk from booking platforms like WebCargo and cargo.one, but added: “You can’t book any kind of shipment through them.</p>
      <p>“We have a real advantage – direct access to our carriers’ booking systems via API. We are ‘Uber-ising’ capacity.</p>
      <p>“Booking platforms aren’t a threat, but distribution channels will change. We don’t want to be just a witness, we want our own integrated platform, with direct access to reservations.”</p>
      <p>ECS is working with a start-up technology company in Singapore to develop the platform, which is expected to be ready in the fourth quarter. It will offer an “automated, dynamic system”, using artificial intelligence to help it learn, and will offer a 30-minute guaranteed booking time.</p>
      <p>“We need to be able to drive our own destiny,” said chief commercial officer Robert van de Weg, “and the real advantage here is that it saves time.”</p>
      <p>However, booking platforms don’t seem worried – and in fact welcome the further digitisation of the industry.</p>
      <p>“GSAs are great,” said WebCargo’s global vice president for business development, Camilo Garcia Cervera. “They are good tools for airlines. I am a firm believer that those which add value have a bright future.”</p>
      <p>But he added it was not comparable to a booking platform.</p>
      <p>“We work with APIs too, but GSAs mainly represent carriers in certain markets. ECS has total control of some airlines, so that specific group may be different. But our goal is to give airlines a global reach. We don’t see GSAs as competition. We don’t buy and sell capacity, we distribute it.</p>
      <p>“The whole trade will become multi-channel from a distribution perspective. Our job is to work with every single player in the industry. We are not a digital GSA. Booking is just one component of the sales process.”</p>
      <p>Cargo.one, which yesterday added a new airline, TAP Air Cargo, to its portfolio, has been a noisy entrant to the booking platform market. Mr Garcia Cervera said he welcomed that competition too. But he said the industry needed more than just e-bookings.</p>
      <p>“We need to look at the entire market, a solution for the entire chain. The industry says it is going to digitise, but that is not just bookings, that’s just one part.</p>
      <p>Freightos, which developed WebCargo, also offers airlines the ability to digitise.</p>
      <p>“We are developing additional products – not every airline is API-capable and we have products for those – the vast majority are not ready.</p>
      <p>“E-booking is not the cheapest of tasks, some airlines don’t have the resolve, the manpower, or the skillset or finances. We can build the API for airlines, it’s a key differentiator. E-booking is one key component of the entire chain; it’s just one of our products.”</p>
      <p>And he added that the industry could benefit from looking beyond its own niche.</p>
      <p>Camilo Garcia Cervera</p>
      <p>“We look outside our industry for innovation, we are constantly looking at what is happening in the global economy and other industries, and how we can adapt that to ours.</p>
      <p>“Air freight is not a one-of-a-kind industry. Sure, it has its own challenges, but it’s not immune to the rest of the world, so why not adapt it to customer purchase behaviour?”</p>
      <p>He added that carriers’ websites were also an important part of the multi-channel mix.</p>
      <p>“We all recognise the value of airline websites, they’re a great exposure tool, but they also understand the benefits of platforms.”</p>
