      <p>Azerbaijan-based cargo airline Silk Way West plans to launch weekly scheduled service on Mondays to Dallas Fort Worth Airport (DFW) using a 747-8F.</p>
      <p>The new service is an expansion of Silk Way West’s three-times-per-week service between its Baku (GYD) hub and Chicago (ORD).</p>
      <p>Silk Way West has grown its North American operations with flights between GYD and ORD, as well as weekly service between GYD and New York’s JFK Airport. The carrier’s general sales agent (GSA) for the U.S., Global Feeder Services, was appointed in August 2019, and has sales offices in Houston, Chicago, New York, Miami and Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p>Kerry Logistics Network Limited has moved its air freight division in the U.K. into a new facility close to London Heathrow Airport (LHR) as its air freight operations continue to expand.</p>
      <p>The Hong Kong-based, third-party logistics company now occupies 40,000 square feet of warehouse space as it gears up to manage the continued growth of its air freight division, particularly in pharmaceuticals and perishables, including shellfish and seafood. The facility provides a 24/7, temperature-controlled, bonded warehouse that includes deep frozen storage, pick-and-pack machinery, vacuum cooling and other operations to meet tight delivery schedules and product shelf life requirements.</p>
      <p>“The new facility will allow us to accommodate the growth in our air freight volumes and help us grow our presence in different verticals,” said David Mallinson, general manager of Kerry Logistics’ U.K. Air Division.</p>
      <p>Mallinson added that the new site also offers full customs clearance and real-time tracking. Additionally, the facility has achieved a rating of AA+ under the new BRC Global Standard for Food Safety Issue 8.</p>

      <p>At Royal Media, Air Cargo World‘s publisher, we take great pride in the value of our exceptional industry conferences and the effort we put into their production. We rightly view our more than a dozen annual conferences as crucial opportunities for business development in our industries.</p>
      <p>Equally, we are greatly focused on the health, safety and well-being of our attendees. I want to personally assure you that Royal Media will continue to prioritize your safety when planning and producing our many events, particularly during this coronavirus situation.</p>
      <p>Part of that commitment is giving you comfort that your registration for a Royal Media event has the appropriate flexibility considering current circumstances. You can rest assured that any registration for our spring events comes with the guarantee that you will receive a credit should the event be canceled. We also commit to maintaining ongoing and comprehensive communications with you — if we change a conference date, we will let you know as soon as possible, so you can adjust your travel plans.</p>
      <p>As of today, we have postponed two of our upcoming conferences: Jet Fuel Innovation Summit will now take place next fall and Cargo Facts Asia will be held May 20-22 in Singapore. Our remaining spring events are keeping their schedules, including the Cargo Airport Growth Summit, June 3-4 in Miami.</p>
      <p>All our fall events remain on track.</p>
      <p>Over and above this registration guarantee, we have instituted best-in-class health and food safety procedures, and we will continue to employ them as standard practice going forward. Our mandate is to continue to be leaders in health and food safety at our conferences.</p>
      <p>For any need or question, we are available to you at +1-619-272-2649 or events@royalmedia.com.</p>
      <p>Our events are crucial forums for our industries, and it is incumbent on each of us to keep our industries economically strong. The COVID-19 situation is unique and, in many ways, unprecedented. But we at Royal are committed to you as our client, no matter what the circumstance. Together, we will get through this.</p>
      <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

    <title>Morgan Stanley: Freight transport feeling impact of COVID-19</title>

      <p>The impact of the novel coronavirus on the freight transportation industry appears to be growing, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey, which found that approximately 80% of stakeholders’ businesses were impacted by COVID-19, compared to around 60% just two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Results from the survey of more than 350 shippers, brokers and carriers overwhelmingly point to industry members’ expectation that the coronavirus impact will expand in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Although some shippers and carriers said they believe this reaction is overblown, they expressed concerns about West Coast and export-related business.</p>
      <p>While only 50% of respondents said they believe the current impact is still “low,” when asked about the impact in three months’ time, the number of respondents expecting “no impact” dropped to less than 15%. Additionally, the total share of stakeholders who believe the current level of impact is “medium” or “high” has doubled in the last two weeks, jumping to around 30%.</p>
      <p>The survey also found that half of those surveyed believe the level of impact will be “medium” or “high” in the next three months, up from 30% who believed this two weeks ago. However, commentary remains mixed as to what exactly what would constitute “medium” to “high” levels of impact.</p>
      <p>Brokers, more so than shippers and carriers, expressed the most negative outlook on the effects of COVID-19 on business, with one respondent saying it was not only a disaster in the short term but might precipitate a global economic downturn.</p>
      <p>Positive commentary, coming mainly from shippers, highlighted the spikes in demand from grocers and other retail partners, as consumers respond to the outbreak by hoarding products like canned food.</p>
