      <p>Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. walked away from their 2020 forecasts and said they will slash operations because of the coronavirus outbreak, joining carriers across the globe grappling with one of the worst crises in modern air travel.</p>
      <p>Delta plans to cut domestic capacity as much as 15% and international flights by 25%, the Atlanta-based carrier said in a statement Tuesday. The company also will freeze hiring and suspend share buybacks. American said it would reduce U.S. service 7.5% in April and cut foreign flights by 10% for the peak summer season.</p>
      <p>The adjustments illustrate the depth of the crisis for carriers worldwide as the virus’s spread upends economies and prompts travelers to stay home. An airline trade group said last week that the industry will lose as much as $113 billion in sales because of the virus, while Jefferies anticipates the biggest annual drop in commercial air traffic since at least the 1970s.</p>
      <p>Already this week, Qantas Airways Ltd. grounded most of its A380 jets, slashed management pay and cut about a quarter of international service for six months; Air France-KLM said its main Paris-based arm would cancel 3,600 flights this month; Finnair Oyj outlined plans to eliminate 2,400 short-distance services in April; and JetBlue Airways Corp. withdrew its 2020 forecast. United Airlines Holdings Inc. abandoned its 2020 forecasts last month.</p>
      <p>Cost Cuts</p>
      <p>“As the virus has spread, we have seen a decline in demand across all entities,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in the statement. “As a result, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to immediately reduce capacity and are implementing cost reductions and cash flow initiatives across the organization.”</p>
      <p>Despite the pain for airlines, U.S. carriers rose Tuesday amid a broad market rally following a historic rout the previous day. Delta climbed 3.4% to $44.99 at 10:02 AM in New York, while American jumped 6.7% to $15.74. A Standard &amp; Poor’s index of major U.S. carriers tumbled 32% this year through Monday, dragged down by the outbreak.</p>
      <p>Adding to the uncertainty for the airline industry, a Trump administration economic package to be unveiled Tuesday will leave out aid for the travel industry, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. While the White House wants to find a way to help reeling airlines, as well as hospitality companies, administration officials remained uncertain about the best way to do so.</p>
      <p>As a show of good faith during tough times, some airline executives have said they would give back some of their compensation. United CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby will give up their base salaries through at least June 30, the carrier said. At Southwest Airlines Co., CEO Gary Kelly said he would take a 10% pay cut amid the drop in bookings, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p>

      <p>CEVA Logistics has opened its own offices in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh, in support of its strategic expansion into the emerging Southeast Asian markets.</p>
      <p>The new head office in Dhaka and operational office in Chittagong were open as of March 9, and will offer freight management services such as purchase order management, container freight station (CFS), customs brokerage and project management, among others.</p>
      <p>CEVA has been operational in Bangladesh through local partners for 17 years, and is opening its own, fully staffed offices in response to the country’s continuing economic growth and increasing demand for exports.</p>
      <p>“Bangladesh is strategically located to support trading with multiple region,” said Russell Pang, managing director emerging markets for CEVA. These markets include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. “It has developed a mature and stable market of exports with the U.S., Europe and China. Our vision is to add greater value and increase service options to the market, notably the textile and garment industries, in addition to the increasing new higher value chain verticals of electronics, technology and health care.”</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, currently the third-largest economy in South Asia, is expected to grow the fastest in the region — by 7.2% in fiscal year 2019-20, according to projections from the World Bank, CEVA stated in a press release. According to CEVA, underlying this projection are the country’s solid macroeconomic framework, political stability, implementation of planned public infrastructure projects and ongoing reforms to improve the business environment.</p>
      <p>CEVA Logistics is a global logistics and supply chain company in both freight management and contract logistics with $7 billion in revenues. Founded in 2007 as a merger of TNT Logistics and EGL Eagle Global Logistics, its head office is located in Baar, Switzerland.</p>

    <title>Lufthansa slices schedule in half on drastic coronavirus hit to sales</title>

      <p>Deutsche Lufthansa AG slashed capacity by as much as 50% in the most aggressive move yet by a major European airline to cope with the severe fall-off in travel triggered by the coronavirus.</p>
      <p>The German airline group cited “drastic declines in bookings and numerous flight cancellations” in recent days, saying all of its traffic is now affected. The carrier’s board decided Friday to reduce capacity even more than it previously had planned, it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“This measure is intended to reduce the financial consequences of the slump in demand,” Lufthansa said. “It complements the planned savings measures in personnel, material costs and project budgets as well as other liquidity measures.”</p>
      <p>Carriers across the globe are cutting back to cope with an oubreak that has rapidly curtailed worldwide air traffic as it spreads from China. Airline stocks in Europe and the U.S. have taken a major hit this week, as the companies scrambled to adjust schedules that had already been tweaked with the expectation the virus would be contained in Asia.</p>
      <p>The International Air Transport Association estimated carriers may lose as much as $113 billion in ticket sales this year — an impact from the epidemic almost four times greater than it had forecast just two weeks earlier.</p>
      <p>All told, Lufthansa shares have lost 23% in the past month, while British Airways parent IAG SA is down 31% and Air France-KLM tumbled 48%. Transatlantic discounter Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, perennially under financial strain, is off more than two-thirds. In the U.S., United Airlines Holdings Inc. skidded 36%, while Delta Airlines Inc. and American Airlines Inc. have declined 21% and 51%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa acted after investors started to question its ability to withstand the downturn. The company’s 5-year credit default swaps, which bondholders buy to protect their holdings against a potential default, more than tripled in the last 10 trading days to the most expensive level in seven years.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the German airline said it had idled capacity translating into about 150 of its aircraft. Grounding half of its about 770-strong fleet would be more than twice that. Lufthansa said it’s considering taking its entire fleet of 14 Airbus A380 super-jumbos out of service in Frankfurt and Munich.</p>
      <p>In another sign of concern, two British Airways baggage handlers at London Heathrow tested positive for the disease, potentially spelling trouble for travel at Europe’s largest hub.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa a week ago said it would extend capacity cuts beyond long-haul flights to and from China, initially the only routes affected, to also cover short-haul flights across Europe after the coronavirus spread to Italy, the group’s second-most-important foreign market.</p>
