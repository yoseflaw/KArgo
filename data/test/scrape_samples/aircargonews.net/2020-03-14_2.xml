      <p>Bin Yousef Cargo’s director of cargo operations at, Jiju Haneef, commented: “Modern fleets of freighters with controlled temperature zones, comfortable and spacious horse stalls and experienced groomers accompanying these horses [are factors that] motivate horse owners around the world, to send their champions to Qatar.</p>
      <p>“The state-of-the-art, on-ground live animal facilities such as air-conditioned holding stalls, a paddock as well as on-site veterinary personnel in Qatar, assures the care, comfort, safety and reliability required for the smooth and stress-free transportation of each equine guest that we handle.”</p>

      <p>IBS Software has signed a five-year contract with Lufthansa Cargo to host and maintain the carrier’s iCAP cargo handling application.</p>
      <p>After having evaluated the capabilities of hosting service providers on factors such as “application availability, security regulatory and data privacy”, Lufthansa Cargo selected IBS Software’s SaaS (software as a service) platform as part of its move to focus on its “core cargo business without compromising on IT operations”.</p>
      <p>As a result of its partnership, Lufthansa Cargo will benefit from IBS Software’s “zero outage” functionality, which enables planned maintenance to be carried out with disruption to Lufthansa Cargo’s IT system.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for IBS Software explained: “This unique capability results in operational stability, which is essential to fulfill the customer promise and to provide effective and seamless cargo handling operations around the clock across all time zones without any service disruptions.</p>
      <p>“Lufthansa Cargo will also benefit from superior and faster application performance of highly complex cargo business functions and processes. As an example, Lufthansa Cargo processes one million messages per day. Each message will now be processed noticeably faster than before in less than one second on the IBS Software SaaS platform.”</p>
      <p>Initial running of the system, which operates from IBS Software’s new data centre in Frankfurt, has shown that the SaaS service has exceeded parameters set by Lufthansa Cargo and with service-level agreement compliance.</p>

      <p>Freight forwarder Damco will begin offering three different service levels across its air and sea operations.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands-headquartered company has branded the service levels: standard, plus and customised.</p>
      <p>All products offer full track-and-trace functions and online booking, with the customised services including tailored benefits such as customised reports, an order management system – giving visibility from purchase order to proof of delivery – and third-party updates.</p>

      <p>“Our experienced customer services team will continue to be the backbone of our offering.”</p>
      <p>The new three-tier service programme is part of the freight forwarder’s ongoing “growth and development strategy”, which will this month see it open a new UK airfreight facility at Heathrow.</p>

      <p>The British International Freight Association (BIFA) is celebrating the first anniversary of its Young Forwarders Network (YFN).</p>
      <p>BIFA launched the YFN, which involves events run by young forwarders in regional networks, in March 2019.</p>
      <p>Since its establishment a year ago, six regional networks have been formed and more than 20 YFN events have been held.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the YFN events is to help young talent and BIFA members to enhance their knowledge and skills in a structured, social environment.</p>
      <p>According to Carl Hobbis (pictured), BIFA’s training development manager, more than 400 young individuals have attended the networking events, “which gives a clear demonstration of their perceived value by the younger generation in the freight forwarding and logistics sector”.</p>
      <p>Hobbis commented: “Each event they attend – whether that is a tour or a talk from an industry professional – they return to the workplace with more knowledge.</p>
      <p>“When the YFN was launched, we said we thought it would prove to be a major step forward for the industry in developing its future freight forwarding ambassadors and leaders.</p>
      <p>“The young people who are joining the various regional groups are improving their knowledge of the sector, trends within it, as well as building their skill sets and learning from others.”</p>

      <p>Airfreight rates from China increased rapidly last week as demand from China begins to ramp up but spare capacity remains tight.</p>
      <p>The latest figures from TAC Index show that last week average airfreight prices from Shanghai to North America increased by 32.3% on a week earlier to $4.02 per kg, while prices from the Chinese city to Europe jumped by 15.8% compared with the prior seven days to $2.71 per kg.</p>
      <p>Prices from Shanghai to North America are now above the $3.29 per kg that carriers were charging on the route at the corresponding point last year and to Europe they are just slightly lower than the $2.75 per kg reported in early March 2019.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, prices from Hong Kong to North America increased by 11.5% week on week to $3.59 per kg and there was a 3.2% increase to $2.58 per kg on services to Europe.</p>
      <p>The price jump from China comes as factories continue to ramp up production following an extend Chinese New Year break as part of efforts to contain the coronavirus.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, capacity remains tight as passenger flights – and therefore belly space – has been cut.</p>
      <p>Peter Stallion of derivatives broker FIS said the price spike doesn’t really come as a surprise.</p>
      <p>He adds that carriers are set to benefit from an emerging price war between oil producing OPEC states and Russia.</p>
      <p>“However, the ongoing impacts of coronavirus dull the benefits of lower input costs, whilst the high airfreight price, although beneficial to the global freighter fleet, cannot be booked as revenue due to the missing belly capacity,” Stallion said.</p>
      <p>“Thus, we’ve seen carriers with a highly abundant fleet of parked passenger aircraft utilise these assets to provide much needed cargo lift.”</p>
      <p>Cathay’s passenger only cargo flights</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Air Cargo News sister title FlightGlobal has reported that following cuts made to its Japan passenger network, Cathay Pacific is considering operating cargo-only services on its passenger aircraft.</p>
      <p>In a notice sent out to its clients, Cathay’s cargo arm says it only expects passenger belly cargo operations to be impacted by recently-announced cuts. However, it is looking at ways to “continue serving our cargo customers to and from Japan”.</p>
      <p>“This includes the retention of certain passenger services for cargo carriage only,” the notice reads.</p>
      <p>Cathay cut most of its flights to and from Japan for March, following newly-imposed travel restrictions – related to the coronavirus outbreak – by Japanese authorities, which said Chinese and Hong Kong passport holders will face a mandatory, two-week quarantine on arrival.</p>
      <p>From 9 March, the airline cut all passenger flights between Hong Kong and Fukuoka, Nagoya, Sapporo, as well as Tokyo Haneda. From 13 March, Tokyo Narita and Osaka Kansai, as well as services between Taipei and Tokyo Narita and Osaka Kansai, will be cancelled.</p>
      <p>The carrier says its freighter operations to Japan remain unaffected. “We will communicate a revised schedule in a timely manner,” it adds.</p>
      <p>Beleaguered Cathay has recently cut capacity across its network, after the coronavirus outbreak hit its already-weakened performance.</p>

      <p>As part of its strategic expansion in the emerging Southeast Asian markets, CEVA Logistics has opened its own offices in Dhaka and Chittagong.</p>
      <p>The logistics firm has been operational in textiles hotspot Bangladesh for 17 years through a network partner, providing logistics services to a number of multinational and local customers.</p>
      <p>The company has now decided to open its own offices with a fully-staffed team in order to meet the country’s continuing economic expansion and increasing demand for exports.</p>
      <p>Its lead office will be located in downtown Dhaka, complemented by an operational office in Chittagong, Bangladesh’s second largest city.</p>
      <p>Through these offices, CEVA will offer a “full range of freight management solutions including purchase order management, CFS (container freight station), customs brokerage, project management and other value-added services”.</p>
      <p>CEVA pointed to statistics showing that Bangladesh, currently the third-largest economy in South Asia, is expected to grow the fastest in the region (by 7.2%) in 2019-20 according to projections from the World Bank.</p>
      <p>“A solid macroeconomic framework, political stability, implementation of planned public infrastructure projects and ongoing reforms to improve the business environment, underlie this projection,” CEVA said.</p>
      <p>Russell Pang, managing director emerging markets (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar), CEVA Logistics, added: “Bangladesh is strategically located to support trading with multiple regions. It has developed a mature and stable market of exports with the US, Europe, and China.</p>
      <p>“Our vision is to add greater value and increase service options to the market, notably the textile and garment industries, in addition to the increasing new higher value chain verticals of electronics, technology and healthcare. We look forward to developing our service profile in line with the increasing demands of our customers.”</p>

      <p>A new £200m logistics and industrial park is being developed at Teesside International Airport in the north east of England.</p>
      <p>A groundbreaking ceremony was held at the start of the month and infrastructure work is now set to begin on the project that will see the creation of 3.4m sq ft of logistics, manufacturing and commercial space built on 270 acres of land at the southside of the airport.</p>
      <p>“Once complete, the development has the potential to create 4,400 jobs and deliver £3m per year to reinvest into the airport,” Tees Valley Combined Authority said.</p>
      <p>The southside land, comprising 270 acres and running parallel to the runway, is the largest area for such a development and will be carried out under a joint venture partnership.</p>
      <p>The Tees Valley Mayor and Combined Authority previously committed to an investment of £23.6m for the development of critical infrastructure, including connecting the site to the main utilities and providing access to the Southside of the airport from the A67.</p>
      <p>Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said: “Hot on the heels announcing summer flights to Alicante for this summer, and the introduction of six new routes across UK and Ireland rolling out now, today I’ve broken ground on the next huge project to secure the future of Teesside Airport.</p>
      <p>“Ever since bringing our airport back into public ownership, I have always said that for it to succeed, we need to be supporting our businesses as well as attracting flights to fantastic destinations for consumers.</p>
      <p>“Today is the next step in achieving a sustainable, appropriate development around our airport, providing a high quality site for businesses, a huge number of which have already expressed an interest at being based here.</p>
      <p>“Not only that, it will help create thousands of good-quality jobs for local people and make sure our airport will be here for years to come, with money from the site reinvested into our airport.”</p>

      <p>Broker Air Charter Service (ACS) has opened a new office in Chicago as it continues its US expansion.</p>
      <p>The office, which is the broker’s tenth in the US, will be headed up by Caitlin Uhlmann, who has worked at ACS for nine years at the company’s offices in Los Angeles, London and Manhattan offices.</p>
      <p>Richard Thompson, ACS Americas’ president, said: “Chicago has been on our radar as a natural location for another US ACS office for a number of years. The city is the third largest in population in the US and has one of the highest GDPs in the world – generating $689bn last year.</p>
      <p>“O’Hare Airport is the sixth busiest in the world and the city is home to many Fortune 500 companies, some of whom are household names. We believe that there is a large market for both our passenger and cargo aircraft charter services here.</p>
      <p>“We have been conducting business with clients from Chicago and the rest of Illinois for many years and are looking forward to building closer relationships with them, as well as welcoming new customers on board.”</p>
      <p>Thompson concluded: “Uhlmann has been instrumental in setting up our last few US offices and I am extremely confident that she is the right person for the job and I’m looking forward to the progression of the new office under her leadership.”</p>

      <p>TIACA has signed an memorandum of understanding (MOU) with CLIVE Data Services to create and deliver air cargo market and route analyses to TIACA members.</p>
      <p>CLIVE, the creator of the new ‘dynamic load factor’ analysis, strives to give the earliest possible barometer of market analysis based on cargo data – volume and weight perspectives of the cargo flown and capacity available – shared by a representative group of global airlines.</p>
      <p>Under the terms of the MOU, CLIVE will provide market data for TIACA’s Cargo Pulse newsletter and social media platforms, and for speakers at TIACA conferences.</p>
      <p>Steven Polmans, chairman of TIACA, explained: “As part of the transformation of TIACA, we are promising to deliver more content to our growing membership – but only content of value to their businesses and which accurately represents and promotes the global air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>“CLIVE’s dynamic load factor [analysis] is registering a lot of interest because it breaks with tradition and is changing the way air cargo usage is measured based on the realities of today’s market. It is also the fastest source of data, which is also very appealing for our members.”</p>
      <p>Niall van de Wouw, managing director of CLIVE Data Services, added: “Working with TIACA enables us to put our market intelligence in front of a large group of respected decision-makers, who we hope will embrace our new load factor methodology.</p>
      <p>“This represents another important step forward in getting the industry to accept there is a new and more accurate way to measure how full flights are.”</p>
      <p>CLIVE Data Services, which also recently became a recent member of TIACA, will deliver its first market analyses to the Association’s members thislater month.</p>

      <p>Luxembourg Airport has selected Nallian to implement a cargo community system (CCS) in order to offer a neutral data sharing platform for businesses based at the hub.</p>
      <p>The airport said that the CCS represented an important component of the Luxembourg Single Window for Logistics programme and will be open to all actors involved in international trade.</p>
      <p>The CCS will enable real-time capturing and sharing of granular information regarding shipment processing, to “better plan and execute” processes and “drive efficiency and visibility with in-depth insights in performance”.</p>
      <p>The first phase of the roll out will cover perishable and live animal shipments and will only be available to Cargolux, LuxairCargo, Kuehne+Nagel, Arthur Welter and the public administrations concerned.</p>

      <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) Cargo, the first airline in the Asia Pacific region to be gain CEIV Pharma certification in 2017, has received renewed certification from IATA.</p>
      <p>The renewed certification comes after SIA expanded its cool chain corridor with the addition of pharma-handling hubs in Copenhagen, Osaka and Stockholm.</p>
      <p>The new cool chain hub destinations are part of SIA’s expanding THRUCOOOL1 pharma corridor, launched in 2018 after initial certification from IATA a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Last year, SIA Cargo signed a three-year agreement with SkyCell that enabled it to lease of temperature-controlled containers designed to optimise the conditions for pharmaceutical products to be transported.</p>
      <p>Chin Yau Seng, SIA’s senior vice president of cargo, commented: “We are pleased that our IATA CEIV Pharma certification has been renewed after a re-certification audit. It reinforces the importance that we place on quality and reliability in the transportation of key pharmaceutical products.</p>
      <p>“We remain committed to rolling out THRUCOOL to more locations with the expansion of our quality corridor network, while also looking for new ways to further enhance the product.”</p>
      <p>Conrad Clifford, IATA ‘s regional vice president, Asia Pacific, added: “Cold chain logistics for pharmaceutical products is a growing segment of the air cargo business, with spending expected to grow 5-6% annually.</p>
      <p>“Singapore Airlines’ renewal of their CEIV Pharma certification ensures that they continue to be well placed to serve the needs of pharmaceutical companies and transport these time and temperature sensitive products to locations around the world where they are most needed while ensuring the product integrity.”</p>
      <p>IATA’s CEIV Pharma certification affirms an airline or businesses’ capability of handling time-sensitive and temperature-controlled cargo with integrity, reliability and efficiency.</p>

      <p>VRR has unveiled an updated design of its inflatable AKE container.</p>
      <p>VRR had planned to showcase the Air7, which it believes will be certified by the third quarter of 2020, at the IATA World Cargo Symposium. However the event was recently postponed due to coronavirus-related fears.</p>
      <p>A prototype of the inflatable AKE, named the Air5, was revealed at last year’s World Cargo Symposium in Singapore and the container design also won the interDESIGN excellence award at Inter Airport Europe 2019.</p>
      <p>Like the prototype, the Air7 can be inflated in seconds and collapsed in less than two minutes by two people.</p>
      <p>However, the Air7 has several also has improvements over the prototype, such as being weatherproof and having a lower folding height.</p>
      <p>Geert van Riemsdijk, managing director of VRR, explained: “Current methods of relocating ULDs are expensive and time consuming.”</p>
      <p>“A container that can be collapsed quickly and easily and then stacked seven high on a lower deck is a game changer for fleet managers.</p>
      <p>“That’s really going to help them cut costs and increase capacity. And we have not even discussed the cost saving when it comes to storage of the containers.”</p>
      <p>Going forward, VRR will incorporate new features into the Air7, such as a fire resistance and a thermal cover.</p>
      <p>“We’re exploring these options because specialised cargo such as perishables and lithium batteries are mostly transported on imbalanced routes with one-way
direction freight,” van Riemsdijk added. </p>

      <p>To mark International Women’s Day (March 8) Emirates SkyCargo has released a video (see below) following an all-women flight deck crew operating multi-stop B777F flights across four continents.</p>
      <p>Captain Ellen Roz from the US and first officer Heidi McDiarmid from Australia cover close to 30,000kms in 10 days on five freighter flights from Frankfurt to Mexico City onwards to Quito, Aguadilla, Amsterdam and finally to Dubai transporting over 300 tonnes of cargo ranging from fresh flowers and fruits to pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>The two pilots were also joined by captain Heather Wolf from Canada for operating the flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Over 75 tonnes of fresh flowers were transported on the freighter flights operated by Roz and McDiarmid from Quito to Aguadilla and from Aguadilla to Amsterdam.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>“Emirates’ freighter flights from Quito create a direct channel for exports for the Ecuadorian floriculture industry to Amsterdam, the world’s largest flower distribution hub,” the carrier said.</p>
      <p>“This supports the local economy in Ecuador and the livelihoods of over 100,000 people in the country who work to cultivate and harvest flowers.</p>
      <p>“Freighter flights also allow for rapid transportation of goods such as life-saving medication from the location where they are manufactured to patients who may urgently need them for treatment. Close to 10 tonnes of valuable pharmaceuticals were transported on the freighter flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City operated by the all-women flight deck crew.”</p>
      <p>Emirates said that women constitute more than 40% of its total workforce with the majority working as cabin crew. Emirates’ female pilots come from over 30 nationalities, covering an age range from 23 to 62 years.</p>
      <p>Women from over 160 nationalities, including more than 1,100 Emiratis, are employed across the Emirates Group in operational roles in functions including flight operations, engineering, aircraft maintenance and appearance, catering, cargo and ramp operations; in customer facing roles in airport services, sales and customer affairs and corporate roles across business support functions.</p>

      <p>Japan Airlines (JAL) has signed up to use IBS Software’s cargo management software as it seeks efficiencies in its IT operations.</p>
      <p>The Japan-based carried will replace multiple legacy systems with IBS’s iCargo Terminal Operations solution for Japan to manage the entire operations process covering the import, export, transfers, warehouse operations and airports operations across the network. It will also implement iCargo for its cargo sales, inventory and reservations.</p>
      <p>“Along with significant savings in legacy system maintenance costs, JAL will also benefit from major efficiency improvements through the iCargo solution,” IBS Software said in a release.</p>
      <p>IBS claims iCargo is the only non-Japanese system in this market that has full Japanese Customs NACCS reporting capabilities.</p>
      <p>“The real time availability of operational information through iCargo also helps generate actionable intelligence to understand the overall utilization of assets and thereby improve operational efficiencies,” the company said. </p>
      <p>Ashok Rajan, senior vice-president and head, cargo and logistics solution business, IBS Software, said: “JAL is an iconic name in the airline industry and we are proud to welcome them to the iCargo community.</p>
      <p>“Their aim is to drive efficiency improvements and iCargo, the leader and IT platform of choice for airlines especially in the Japanese market, will help their transformation into digital freight.”</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo saw both cargo volumes and revenues fall in 2019 as a result of fleet rationalisation programme and a weak market.</p>
      <p>The Abu Dhabi headquartered carrier saw 2019 cargo volumes fall by 6.9% year on year to 635,000 tonnes, while total revenues fell by 15.7% year on year to $700m,</p>
      <p>This decline is mostly attributable to the full-year effect of belly-hold and freighter capacity rationalisation undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2018, combined with adverse market conditions that resulted in yields dropping by 7.8%.</p>
      <p>IATA estimates that the overall cargo market declined by 3.3% last year.</p>
      <p>The carrier said it “remained committed to its transformation in 2019” despite the “challenging market headwinds”.</p>
      <p>Etihad has reduced its freighter fleet and invested in its digital services over the last couple of years.</p>
      <p>It also recently entered into a major GSA partnership with the ECS Group.</p>
      <p>“Underlying transformation results were visible in the fourth quarter, having recorded a 5.6% increase in FTKs over the same period in 2018, with 1.7 percentage points higher load factors,” the carrier said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the overall Etihad business saw revenues drop by around 5.4% to €5.6bn while losses were reduced to $870m, compared with $1.3bn last year.</p>

      <p>TAP Air Portugal (TAP), the country’s flagship airline, has entered into a partnership with cargo e-booking platform cargo.one.</p>
      <p>The digital platform will be connected with TAP’s cargo system in the second quarter of this year.</p>
      <p>The partnership will provide TAP with access to cargo.one’s customer base and a faster channel to market for new cargo products.</p>
      <p>It will also provide TAP with digital capabilities, such as online distribution and dynamic pricing, as well as reinforcing “operational efficiency and day-to-day service quality of the airline”.</p>
      <p>Moritz Claussen, managing director of cargo.one, commented: “We are delighted that the TAP Air Cargo team has selected cargo.one to help drive their extraordinary growth and transformation.</p>
      <p>“At cargo.one we strive to work with the most forward-thinking airlines around the globe. TAP Air Cargo has an outstanding team, that has shown foresight to embrace technology in order to drive growth and to put its customers first.”</p>
      <p>Bernardo Nunes, product and services senior manager at TAP Air Cargo, added: “We are increasingly interested in providing new cargo products to our customers and will leverage cargo.one as a distribution channel for those.</p>
      <p>“The platform represents an excellent channel for effectively marketing products to freight forwarders with fast lead times, better exposure, and less complicated processing than with traditional channels.</p>
      <p>“Time to market is absolutely critical to us, as we understand that together with excellent access, and unique user experience these are key attributes towards complete customer centricity.” </p>
      <p>Numerous leading airlines are already connected with and distribute their air cargo capacity on cargo.one. The platform is also used by more than 400 freight forwarders. </p>
