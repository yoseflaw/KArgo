      <p>Digitisation could make freight forwarders redundant in the next 20 years unless they significantly adapt their business model.</p>
      <p>As data in the supply chain becomes increasingly transparent, in a bid for seamless flows of information and cargo, the forwarders' advantage ebbs, delegates heard at Air Cargo India in Mumbai this week.</p>
      <p>Two of the three flows controlled by the forwarder – the documents and the money – will be taken over by technology. The third flow – the cargo itself – will be carried by, of course, the carrier.</p>
      <p>One delegate said: "I feel great fear for the forwarder," while another asked: "Is there a future for the freight forwarder, or will it come down to those with actual assets?"</p>
      <p>One senior freight forwarder, speaking privately on the sidelines of the conference, noted that once the data is opened up and made transparent – something that other stakeholders in the fragmented supply chain are keen to do – they will no longer enjoy the advantage that has kept them in the business.</p>
      <p>Amar More, CEO of Kale Logistics Solutions, which has just announced the first ever digital air freight corridor, between Mumbai and Amsterdam, said: "This industry is ripe for blockchain and digitisation."</p>
      <p>Shantanu Bhadkamkar, chairman of the International Federation of Customs Brokers Association, added: "The effect on forwarders will be quite significant. But disruptions in the past have helped us to grow."</p>
      <p>Already shippers are starting to control their own flows, enabled by technology. Garment retail group Inditex books its own freight; Amazon controls its own freight flows.</p>
      <p>One air freight chief executive told The Loadstar that he could not see a future for freight forwarders. "There simply won't be a role of them to play. I honestly think they won't be needed. Everything else can be done with technology or carried by the asset-owners."</p>
      <p>But one forwarder, while agreeing his industry's days were numbered, said it "would not happen overnight".</p>
      <p>"We'll have to wait for all the elements in the chain to open up first – such as Customs, and that will take some time. But forwarders should be looking at investing in technology – and there will still be niche products that will require expertise, such as pharma and so on."</p>
      <p>A recent McKinsey report also points to a longer-term change. "An even bigger question hanging over the business today is digitisation. New technologies, such as advanced analytics and machine learning, can help companies automate some of their back-end and customer-facing processes and raise levels of utilisation. But these technologies will disrupt air freight forwarding profoundly over time."</p>
      <p>Forwarders also don't work to global standards, possibly slowing down their demise. DHL offers different solutions to Kuehne + Nagel for example. There is no standardisation of processes.</p>
      <p>Airlines, as ever, were not only extremely wary of predicting the demise of the forwarders, but also noted that they currently rely on them as partners, or "the first line of enablement", as IATA cargo chief Glyn Hughes said.</p>
      <p>Cathay Pacific's Mark Sutch added: "Forwarders play an extremely important part in air freight and that's not going to change."</p>
      <p>However, Jacob Matthew, president middle east for National Air Cargo, while not talking about the role of forwarders, simply where he sees his company in 10 years, said: "We will try to integrate elements, looking at what the integrators do. We just have to take some of the steps they do. And we'll one day be our own Amazon."</p>

    <title>Virgin Atlantic Cargo eyes a digital future</title>

      <p>Virgin Atlantic Cargo has just announced that it is the first to adopt the 8.0 version of the cloud-enabled, end-to-end Accenture Freight &amp; Logistics Software (AFLS) platform which Accenture says will "reinvent the way [Virgin] communicate and operate with customers, employees and partner ecosytems."</p>
      <p>Reinvent in what way exactly? And who benefits the most?</p>
      <p>Dominic Kennedy, managing director, cargo for Virgin Atlantic, is happy to give an example.</p>
      <p>"If a customer contacts us today and asks for a quote for space on a direct flight from A to B on a particular day, the system gives a binary answer: 'Yes' or 'No'.</p>
      <p>"The new system is much more responsive in that it will immediately offer alternatives, maybe flying via C and/or showing earlier or later flights where space is available." </p>
      <p>Once the system is fully operational, Virgin Atlantic customers' systems will be able to interface directly through APIs and connect with a new web platform for pricing, bookings, allocations and operations. It will even offer 'live chat' and Chatbots interaction if customers prefer that option.</p>
      <p>Kennedy claims the new system, due to go live in early 2020, will allow Virgin to "leapfrog rather than catch-up with" its competitors, especially once all the phases are operational.</p>
      <p>"Today we do not have a 'dot com' offering.  Our current Voyager system is ten years old and coming to end of its natural life. We do not see that making lots of incremental changes is the answer to meeting our customers' demands."</p>
      <p>He says that with the Virgin/Delta partnership now five years old, they are, in any case, entering a "new strategic phase" and technologically-enabled change is an important part of that.</p>
      <p>The Virgin Atlantic team assessed at least ten options before choosing AFLS 8.0 with a key deliverable being access to its partners' inventories, and the interface with customers' systems.</p>
      <p>"The decision was also, in part, informed by a long history of engagement with our customers about what they wanted Virgin to adopt," says Kennedy.</p>
      <p>Of course, it is important that the need to improve physical operations is not lost in this worldwide focus on digitalisation, not least because the new technology should be driving greater volumes, which are moving more quickly.</p>
      <p>Virgin and Delta are moving into new premises at dnata City East at Heathrow in September, doubling their current space to 335,000 sq ft and also doubling the number of cargo doors to 18. Exports will move there first, with imports following in about 18 months.</p>
      <p>Kennedy says: "It is an exciting time to be in the industry. The need for advanced technology has brought in fresh minds, which has challenged us to look at things differently. In the end it is all about adding value for customers so that we all benefit."</p>

      <p>Source: Brussels Airport</p>
      <p>In the air cargo field, ground handling and technology adoption rates are recurring targets for criticism. With the launch of its new BRUcloud slot-booking service, the Brussels Airport (BRU) cargo community is set to kill two birds with one app.</p>
      <p>The "Slot Booking App" (one of several applications on the BRUcloud data-sharing platform) is set to go live on Monday, Jan. 15, when a select number of gates at Aviapartner and Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) warehouses will be bookable in advance to forwarders via the app. Eventually, BRU and developer Nallian expect the app will be rolled out to all forwarders, ground handlers and trucking companies operating at Brussels Airport and in other cargo communities around the world.</p>
      <p>BRU announced the gradual roll-out of the app to streamline cargo pickup and delivery at ground handling facilities back in May 2017. Through the app, forwarders will be able to request ad hoc delivery slots ahead of time, or reserve a recurring time slot. The expected benefits of the app to the airport community include the elimination of waiting times at ground handling facilities, streamlined workload and personnel planning for ground handlers, and increased optimizations generally allowed by data-sharing early in the ground-handling process.</p>
      <p>During the first phase of the app's roll-out, slots that are bookable through the app will be marked with the app's logo. Companies participating in the launch include: Aviapartner, WFS Belgium, Nippon Express Belgium, DHL Global Forwarding, Kuehne + Nagel, Panalpina and Sky Fast. DHL Global Forwarding, Deutsche Post-DHL Group's ocean- and air-forwarding arm, was the first booker of an official slot for Monday's launch, while more than 100 slots have now been booked for the first days.</p>

    <content>
      <p>China Cosco Shipping executive vice president Wang Haimin has rubbished the idea that carriers can be sole service providers of end-to-end container supply chains.</p>
      <p>Mr Wang (pictured) drew comparison between competitors Maersk and CMA CGM's push to become fully integrated container logistics providers and, at the other end of the spectrum, MSC and Hapag-Lloyd's apparent focus on pure port-to-port shipping.</p>
      <p>"Cosco is somewhere in the middle," he told delegates at the TPM Asia conference in Shenzhen this week.</p>
      <p>He believed: "One solution provider can't provide all the required services, logistics is too fragmented. In terms of manpower, freight forwarders work five times harder per teu shipped.</p>
      <p>"Logistics chains can't be provided just by shipping lines, so Cosco is willing to work with ports, freight forwarders and shippers to create a harmonic ecosystem and enhance cooperation so each segment creates value."</p>
      <p>For example, Mr Wang said, total logistics solutions for shippers must include more intermodal connections, such as ocean-rail, which can't be done by one provider.</p>
      <p>However, while noting that digitalisation would "redefine the container shipping business model by enhancing customer experience," he admitted the digital-frenzy had sidetracked the industry from service quality.</p>
      <p>"On-time arrivals are very important," Mr Wang said. "So, at the end of the year, we will publish an index of timeliness and produce standards and bespoke solutions using big data."</p>
      <p>According to Alan Murphy, chief executive of Sea-Intelligence, schedule reliability has recovered this year after falling to all-time lows in 2018. A major part of the problem, he said, was that carriers' marketing departments needed to "stop lying" about unrealistic transit times.</p>
      <p>Bjorn Vang Jensen, vice president of global logistics at Electrolux, one of the world's largest shippers, added: "We've seen a remarkably strong increase in port arrival reliability with all of our carriers this year, because we made an effort in negotiations to say 'stop this nonsense, you never arrive in Long Beach in 14 days, so quote 16 days instead'.</p>
      <p>"I place value on knowing I can trust a carrier," he said, noting that Electrolux's factory planners in Europe and the US rely on receiving components from Asia, and that cargo delays can result in closures that could cost €400,000.</p>
      <p>"Where we see things falling down is on the inland side," he continued. "It is hugely important and, here again, we find that while carriers have got better at being honest on port arrival times, they're still fudging the numbers on the inland leg."</p>
      <p>Mr Jensen said the "jury was still out" on whether the solution was to replace global forwarders with the integrated logistics offerings now being touted by the likes of Maersk and CMA CGM.</p>
      <p>"We haven't tried those integrated products yet; they're still figuring out how to do it," he noted. However, he hinted at an upcoming pilot with Maersk in the US.</p>
      <p>"These kind of services have potential, but it's not easy to integrate logistics units into liner operations, they're fundamentally different," Mr Jensen said.</p>

    <title>Alert to airlines on 'unsafe' hoverboards as IATA calls for stiff penalty for shippers that mis-declare battery devices</title>

      <p>IATA is warning airlines, airports and passengers to take special note of regulations covering hoverboards – this Christmas's toy of choice – and called for heavy penalties, including prison, for shippers failing to obey the rules.</p>
      <p>Airlines have been concerned over the safety of the 'vehicles', which in many cases have caught fire while being charged-up – or even when being used.</p>
      <p>As the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission warned this morning of the risk of battery fires in the devices, echoing UK and US consumer groups, IATA issued a notice to airlines after consultation with members of ICAO's Dangerous Goods Panel.</p>
      <p>"These devices are not 'mobility aids', but instead should be treated as 'portable electronic devices'," it said, adding that they should be subject to the rules for the transport of lithium ion batteries.</p>
      <p>UK Trading Standards has examined 17,000 hoverboards in the past two months and found that an astonishing 88% failed basic safety checks.</p>
      <p>Dave Brennan, assistant director cargo safety and standards for IATA, said airlines were concerned. One carrier had been approached to provide a 747F charter flight to carry just hoverboards.</p>
      <p>"Many airlines have banned them from passenger bellies," he said.</p>
      <p>"They are catching fire anywhere – one family suffered a house fire when charging it, and someone else's caught fire when being used.</p>
      <p>"We are trying to alert airports. Passengers buy one at an airport, then want to take them on to the aircraft in hand luggage. Airlines don't want to take them.</p>
      <p>"We have told airports that passengers may not be able to take them on aircraft."</p>
      <p>The lithium battery-powered devices in question include the airwheel, solowheel, hoverboard, mini-segway and balance wheel.</p>
      <p>The issue has brought the transport of dangerous goods to the forefront again, with lithium batteries remaining a contentious subject – as well as a growing one.</p>
      <p>Mr Brennan pointed out that a staggering 400m lithium cells are made each week.</p>
      <p>Defending the recent controversial decision of ICAO's Dangerous Goods Panel not to ban the bulk shipment of rechargeable lithium batteries on passenger aircraft, Mr Brennan laid the responsibility on governments and regulators and called for tough sentences for rule-breaking.</p>
      <p>"There has been a significant increase in incidents and we need to reduce that. We need to engage with everybody upstream. E-commerce sites have not done enough work to make sellers and customers aware.  But regulators and governments need to enforce the rules."</p>
      <p>He said airlines and civil aviation departments didn't have the authority to put in place checks or penalties for low-grade, unsafe battery manufacturers.</p>
      <p>"If it's not part of air transport, then civil aviation authorities have no jurisdiction. You can't ask to do tests on batteries. It needs engagement from governments. They could be taken by road to another country and then shipped by air – so the original civil aviation autority would have no jurisdiction in the second country."</p>
      <p>IATA has run a series of training workshops in China, Indonesia and the Philippines on dangerous goods and lithium batteries.</p>
      <p>Mr Brennan added that IATA was working with the Universal Postal Union, which was putting up notices in post offices.</p>
      <p>"The rules need to be more visible to people selling on e-commerce sites. We call on governments to take responsibility for oversight and the enforcement of dangerous goods rules. Action needs to be taken over shippers that put air transport at risk.</p>
      <p>"Non-compliant shippers will mis-declare and still try to transport them, whatever the rules. Consumer safety is of paramount importance, but we believe it is the responsibility of governments – it's not aviation's role."</p>
      <p>Citing the example of a pyrotechnic maker in the UK, who mis-declared a shipment and was sent to prison for 18 months, Mr Brennan said: "If more people went to prison, it would focus the attention of the shippers."</p>

    <content>
      <p>Australia's terminal operators have offset dwindling container volumes and quayside revenue by hiking controversial 'port infrastructure' charges.</p>
      <p>According to the Container stevedoring monitoring report 2018-19, published today by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), throughput at the country's terminals increased just 0.2% to 7.88m teu – the second lowest rate in a decade.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, full container lifts fell 4.9%, compared with a 14.6% uptick in empty container lifts.</p>
      <p>"Industry volumes were slightly better when measured on a teu basis, as cargo owners continued to increasingly adopt 40ft containers instead of 20ft containers," ACCC noted.</p>
      <p>"The slowdown in container volume growth reflects weakening economic activity in goods distribution industries such as retail and manufacturing.</p>
      <p>"In addition, the drought in eastern Australia and floods in Queensland negatively impacted volumes of various export commodities such as grain, hay and cotton."</p>
      <p>The report says the increased competition between stevedores with the arrival of relative newcomers Victoria International Container Terminal (VICT) and Hutchison Ports, has seen the share of incumbents Patrick and DP World Australia (DPWA) decline to 82%, the lowest on record.</p>
      <p>ICTSI's VICT was the biggest winner, doubling its share of Melbourne lifts to 15%, while DPWA's overall nationwide share declined from 44% to 39%.</p>
      <p>Quayside revenue per lift continued a downward slide, falling 8.1%, year on year, to A$190.40 (US$131.35), reflecting the continued growth in shipping lines' bargaining power and the relatively high proportion of empty containers, ACCC said.</p>
      <p>However, higher infrastructure charges, levied on truckers and passed on to cargo owners, helped drive the stevedores' overall growth in unit revenues for the first time since 2011–12, increasing 1.8% to A$268.50.</p>
      <p>"Revenue from landside and other sources increased by 12.9% to A$78.10 per container, due mainly to increases in infrastructure charges. These revenues now make up 29% of the total."</p>
      <p>The industry's total revenue generated from infrastructure charges jumped 63% to A$167m, while operating profit fell by 4.7% to A$81.3m.</p>
      <p>ACCC said it was understandable for stevedores to seek to recover some costs from landside transport operators, but cautioned that they were earning a growing portion of their revenues from customers that have limited alternatives.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the row over infrastructure charges spread to the west coast port of Fremantle, where DPWA announced it would increase the fee on laden containers from A$8.22 to A$45 from 1 January.</p>
      <p>In a letter to customers, DPWA's general manager commercial Sean Barrett said: "Our industry is experiencing rising costs in the most dynamic and competitive market conditions in decades.</p>
      <p>"Operating costs at Fremantle Terminal have risen considerably in the last five years. DPWA has continued to absorb the majority of these costs whilst focusing on productivity initiatives to offset the cost increases.</p>
      <p>"These initiatives have delivered a 20% improvement in road efficiency for carriers and contributed to an increase in rail utilisation, however the material rise in costs can no longer be offset by productivity improvements.</p>
      <p>"DPWA has also continued to invest at our Fremantle Terminal with more than A$16m in critical infrastructure to keep pace with industry expectations, and handle greater peaks and troughs in cargo arrival patterns."</p>
      <p>However, Fremantle Ports chief executive Chris Leatt-Hayter responded: "DP World's action is disappointing, given the substantial effort both parties have made to reach agreement on the new lease arrangements over the past months.</p>
      <p>"It also confirms Fremantle Ports' concerns about the level of future infrastructure surcharges if no agreed approach is in place under the new lease."</p>

      <p>RUSSIA must continue to invest in airport infrastructure to ensure its air cargo industry thrives, says Volga-Dnepr Group's president, Alexey Isaikin (right).</p>
      <p>Isaikin suggest strong sustainable growth will see Russia benefit from higher than average gains in export and import traffic as well as the development of a substantial multi-billion dollar domestic air cargo market. This will also stimulate the market for Russian-built cargo aircraft and bring new employment and growth opportunities for businesses involved in supplying components and other services to aircraft manufacturers.</p>
      <p>"Over five years, our scheduled cargo airline, AirBridgeCargo Airlines, has increased its cargo volume processed through Moscow's Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo Airports to 300,000 tons. Our growth has served as the basis for the establishment and development of the elementary cargo infrastructure at the two leading airports of Russia and we hope their development will continue to keep pace with air cargo growth forecasts because this will bring important benefits to the Russian economy.</p>
      <p>"Four modern cargo hubs in Moscow, St.  Petersburg, Vladivostok and Novosibirsk or Krasnoyarsk, each having one million tons capacity, could generate $24 billion of revenue from processing air cargo."</p>

      <p>Panalpina is enlarging the company's executive board, to include its three core products: air freight, ocean freight, and logistics.</p>
      <p>"Our company has ambitious growth targets for the coming years and a clearly defined plan for reaching them. Our three products – Air Freight, Ocean Freight, and Logistics and Manufacturing – will be critical drivers accelerating Panalpina's growth, and that is why we need direct engagement in the decision-making process at the highest management level," says Panalpina CEO Stefan Karlen.</p>
      <p>Panalpina also confirmed two of the new roles on the Executive Board for air freight and ocean freight; it will make a further announcement on logistics at a later date.</p>
      <p>Swiss-born Lucas Kuehner, an 18-year Panalpina veteran, is being promoted to executive vice president, Air Freight, effective January 1, 2019. He has worked at Panalpina since 2000, and has risen through the ranks, holding senior roles in Switzerland and in the USA. He has been the global head of Air Freight and a member of Panalpina's Executive Committee since 2012.</p>
      <p>Danish-born Peder Winther, new to Panalpina, is to become executive vice president, Ocean Freight. He will join Panalpina on February 1, 2019. He has nearly 30 years of international experience in the freight forwarding and transportation industry. Winther joins Panalpina from Kuehne + Nagel, where he most recently served as president and regional manager Western Europe. Daryl Ridgway remains global head of Ocean Freight until the beginning of 2019. His future role within the organization will be communicated at a later date.</p>
      <p>"We've successfully turned around contract logistics and also established Logistics Manufacturing Services (LMS) as an innovative, industry-leading offering and an important differentiator for Panalpina. Our focus is now on improving top-line growth so as to firmly establish logistics and manufacturing as the third strong product in the long-term. We are currently further developing the growth strategy and refining the positioning for this part of our business," explains Stefan Karlen.</p>
