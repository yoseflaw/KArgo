      <p>Pelican BioThermal, the global name in temperature controlled packaging, has been recognised as Supply Chain Innovator at the 2018 "Made in Minnesota Manufacturing Awards" by Minnesota Business magazine.</p>
      <p>The award recognises "leaders and the innovation and ingenuity of the state's manufacturing businesses," says the magazine. Award nominees were evaluated by a nine-judge panel of local manufacturing leaders.</p>
      <p>"Minnesota has been a hub of biopharma development for decades, and we have worked hard to match the pace of innovation," says Pelican BioThermal president David Williams. "We are grateful to be recognised for the hard work our team has performed to drive innovation in the transportation of the latest generation of medical treatments and blood products. At nearly 80 drop-points and network stations across the world, our Crēdo on demand program is the culmination of years of hard work by our Minnesota engineers and logistics professionals."</p>
      <p>Pelican BioThermal provides the life sciences industry with the most comprehensive suite of patented and award-winning thermal protection packaging solutions for the safe transport of pharmaceuticals, clinical trials, diagnostics, tissue, vaccines and blood supplies. This award comes on the heels of its European office, Peli BioThermal, receiving its second successive Queen's Award for Enterprise, the United Kingdom's most distinguished business award. Additionally, Pelican BioThermal has announced new network locations in Indianapolis, Indiana, Frankfurt, Germany and Sao Paulo, Brazil as well as key hires to further grow its international footprint.</p>

      <p>Who'd have thought a product called "Amazing Liquid Fire" could be dangerous air cargo? Apparently, not Amazon.</p>
      <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) didn't think carrying the product, sold as a drain cleaner, was such a hot idea and is looking to slap Amazon with a US$350,000 fine for allegedly shipping prohibited and dangerous goods by air. The proposed fine stems from a 2014 spill of the caustic product, which sent nine UPS employees to the chemical wash after they felt a burning sensation.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time that shippers have been burned for moving prohibited cargo. In 2015, the FAA levied more than $4.5 million in penalties for improper shipments of hazardous air cargo, an increase from $3.4 million in 2014, according to the Dallas Morning News.</p>
      <p>Amazon is feeling the heat, and working with the FAA on the issue, the Seattle-based online retailer said in an e-mailed statement. "We ship tens of millions of products every day and have developed sophisticated technologies to detect potential shipping hazards and use any defects as an opportunity for continuous improvement," the company said. And with an estimated 3.3 million packages a day, 24 documented violations per year jives with the company's defense.</p>
