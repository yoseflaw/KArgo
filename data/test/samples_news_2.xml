      <p>Lufthansa Cargo AG selects IBS Software’s industry-first ‘zero outage’ SaaS solution to host and maintain its iCAP cargo handling application platform.</p>
      <p>IBS Software has signed a five-year contract with Lufthansa Cargo to take full ownership of Lufthansa Cargo’s iCAP cargo handling application platform, which is powered by IBS Software’s iCargo cargo management platform.</p>
      <p>With zero outage capability, planned maintenance is completed with absolutely no outage to the business IT system – one of the major benefits for Lufthansa Cargo. This unique capability results in operational stability, which is essential to fulfil the customer promise and to provide effective and seamless cargo handling operations around the clock across all time zones without any service disruptions.</p>
      <p>Initial performance of the system, which operates from IBS Software’s new data centre in Frankfurt, has shown that the SaaS service has exceeded the benchmarks in all parameters set by Lufthansa Cargo, with 100% SLA compliance.</p>
      <p>“IBS Software has consistently delivered beyond expectations throughout our relationship that started with the iCAP implementation. They have demonstrated their capability to take on the established leaders in application hosting and offer a true SaaS provisioning that helps us to focus on our core competencies. We greatly value the responsibility and commitment that IBS Software brings to the table,” commented Dr Jochen Göttelmann, CIO at Lufthansa Cargo.</p>

      <p>Enterprise solutions company Tigers is working with shipping and distribution specialist Asendia to provide a postal solution for the European B2C market.</p>
      <p>Tigers is set to enhance its abilities within the European B2C market, particularly for customers with low-value orders, by adding a competitive postal solution for small-sized and low-weight orders as a new and additional offering.</p>
      <p>Through the expanded agreement, Berne-headquartered Asendia’s standard goods and fully tracked goods services – Asendia’s track and trace solutions – will be utilised by Tigers to meet and exceed customer requirements across Europe with new postal opportunities.</p>
      <p>“Through our co-operation with Asendia we are now able to provide an additional layer of service to our customers’ ever-evolving e-commerce requirements,” said Shahar Ayash, regional managing director Tigers, Europe.</p>
      <p>“In Rotterdam we serve a number of brands as a regional and global hub and the Postal Solution fits their strategy to reach everywhere in an economic way without the need to open new hubs and the associated implications.</p>
      <p>“The courier companies will continue to play an important role of course, however services like our postal solution for low value products are being increasingly requested.”</p>
      <p>Lennart Otte, sales manager Tigers Netherlands, added: “We have seen a growing number of new customers moving towards this postal solution and I believe that it will continue to create interest in the market.</p>
      <p>“The postal service has improved a lot in the last few years in order to meet the new demands and we are looking to expand this to additional hubs we have in the region soon.”</p>
      <p>The growing collaboration strengthens the existing relationship between Tigers and Asendia that has seen Tigers’ extensive warehousing network across Australia being used as the local logistics partner for Asendia’s new Oceania e-commerce and mail solutions subsidiary.</p>

      <p>A recent report has suggested that the global e-commerce logistics market is likely to exceed $570 billion by 2024. Simon Wong, CEO of the U-Freight Group, has released a statement reinforcing the fact that his company is ready to meet the ever-increasing challenges of providing logistics services to this rapidly expanding sector of global trade.</p>
      <p>“Transport intelligence, a major provider of market research solutions to the global logistics industry, says e-commerce is quite a puzzle for logistics service providers,” writes Wong.</p>
      <p>“The “exponential growth” of e-commerce and the increased role of consumers in individual transactions pose several challenges to governments and businesses alike, whether in terms of trade facilitation, safety/security or the collection of duties and taxes.</p>
      <p>“At U-Freight, in our development of e-commerce logistics solutions, we are continually trying to address the key issues stemming from increasing volumes of business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce shipments and the time sensitivity thereof.</p>
      <p>“Examples of those efforts include investment in several of the company’s warehouse facilities to enable them to act as e-commerce fulfilment centres. We are a logistics partner of choice for the growing number of online channels and platforms which entrepreneurs are using to sell their own designs and products, including global eCommerce shipping platforms such as Easyship, and are heavily involved in the Fulfilment by Amazon programme in several countries.</p>
      <p>“In 2019, we launched e+Solutions, a new product to assist small businesses with their e-commerce logistics needs. We have also been qualified by China Customs and CIQ (China Inspection and Quarantine) as a licensed Cross-border E-Commerce Enterprise and as a Cross-Border E-Commerce Logistics Service Provider.</p>
      <p>“All of these initiatives are helping us boost efficiency and capture more value, in order to capitalise on the opportunities that e-commerce is presenting.”</p>

      <p>The British International Freight Association’s (BIFA) Young Forwarders Network (YFN) is celebrating one year of operation.</p>
      <p>The YFN was launched in March 2019 to create several regional networking groups, run by young forwarders and designed to help early talent and young BIFA members develop their knowledge and professional skills, but in a more social environment.</p>
      <p>One year on, six regional networks have already been established with more in the pipeline, and more than 20 networking events have been held, with many more scheduled for the remainder of the year.</p>
      <p>“Each event the YFN attend – whether that is a tour or a talk from an industry professional – they return to the workplace with more knowledge. When the YFN was launched, we said we thought it would prove to be a major step forward for the industry in developing its future freight forwarding ambassadors and leaders. The young people who are joining the various regional groups are improving their knowledge of the sector, trends within it, as well as building their skill sets and learning from others,” Carl Hobbis, BIFA’s training development manager has said.</p>
      <p>The next Heathrow networking event with take place in Staines on March 24, 2020, will focus on technology in the supply chain, with attendees receiving a presentation from Waldo Remijn, director process &amp; technology excellence at OIA Global.</p>

      <p>TIACA will deliver the latest market and route analyses to its members after signing an intelligence sharing agreement with CLIVE Data services, creators of the new ‘dynamic load factor’ analyses.</p>
      <p>“As part of the transformation of TIACA, we are promising to deliver more content to our growing membership – but only content of value to their businesses and which accurately represents and promotes the global air cargo industry. CLIVE’s dynamic load factor is registering a lot of interest because it breaks with tradition and is changing the way air cargo usage is measured based on the realities of today’s market. It is also the fastest source of data, which is also very appealing for our members,” says Steven Polmans, Chairman of TIACA.</p>
      <p>A recent TIACA survey showed that its members are looking to the Association to educate the industry on air cargo economics and provide more market-based data and analysis. Under the terms of the agreement, CLIVE will provide market data for TIACA’s Cargo Pulse newsletter as well as regular market trends content for social media and speakers at the Association’s conferences on market and route trends</p>
      <p>“Working with TIACA enables us to put our market intelligence in front of a large group of respected decision-makers, who we hope will embrace our new load factor methodology. This represents another important step forward in getting the industry to accept there is a new and more accurate way to measure how full flights are,” commented Niall van de Wouw.</p>

      <p>UK Midlands-based global logistics, warehousing and transport business Amco Services International has appointed Mark Jones to the newly created role of operations director following significant business growth.</p>
      <p>The appointment sees Jones, who joined Amco in 2016 as head of operations, taking responsibility across the group for Amco’s UK and Eastern European transport and vehicle fleet, driver compliance and Health and Safety.

Mark and his team are also key in making sure our customers receive the highest level of service and management attention.”</p>
      <p>After impressive 53% growth over the past three years, Amco is positioned for a strong 2020 across their our UK sites. They will continue to invest in IT and capital investments in the UK but also invest into their fleet in Eastern Europe.</p>

      <p>Aeroflot has temporarily suspended its flight schedule for Italy, France, Germany and Spain, from Moscow between March 13 and April 30 in an effort to restrict the spread of COVID-19.</p>
      <p>Locations affected will include, Alicante, Valencia, Malaga, Palma, Maseille, Lyon, Nice, Dresden, Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Hannover, Stuttgart, Milan, Venice, Napoli, Verona and Bologna. Roysia flights under commercial management of Aeroflot will also temporarily suspend flights to Nice, Dusseldorf and Hamburg within the same time frame.</p>
      <p>Due to a high number of Russian citizens currently in Tenerife, flights will continue to operate from March 13 – 20 on charter basis solely to return passengers to their original point of departure.</p>
      <p>The effected routes will therefore have limited cargo exchange as belly cargo is drastically reduced as a result of the suspension.</p>

      <p>Following President Trump’s announcement of strict travel restrictions for 30 days, from Europe to the US, in a bid to combat the spread of the coronavirus, PML – the global perishable cargo specialists – advises a solution is available to overcome this dramatic turn of events.</p>
      <p>The new rules, which go into effect on Friday 13th, at midnight, are directed at the 26 European states in the Schengen area but does not include the UK or Ireland.</p>
      <p>Nick Finbow, sales director at PML commented, “We recognise the major concerns this will cause for so many of our clients but for us it is very much business as usual. European companies, or companies with a European base that are looking to send their goods to the US can forward their cargo to the UK and we will seamlessly send the consignment onto the US.</p>
      <p>“Similarly, if a cargo is scheduled to return from the US back into Europe, we can receive the goods into the UK, undertake all the necessary customs clearance checks and deliver to the desired European destination. The restriction applies to people, not goods and with our established expertise in transferring cargo, we have the capacity to enable the continued transportation of goods to and from the US.”</p>

      <p>Norwegian airlines have announced that due to the COVID-19 outbreak they are preparing to cancel around 3,000 flights between mid-March and mid-June, which is around 15% of total capacity for this period.</p>
      <p>The reduction in demand on future bookings has meant Norwegian have had implement temporary layoffs of a significant share of its workforce.</p>
      <p>“This is a critical time for the aviation industry, including us at Norwegian. We encourage the authorities to immediately implement measures to imminently reduce the financial burden on the airlines in order to protect crucial infrastructure and jobs,” said Jacob Schram, CEO of Norwegian.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, cancellations will affect a significant share of our colleagues at Norwegian. We have initiated formal consultations with our unions regarding temporary layoffs for flying crew members as well as employees on the ground and in the offices. We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with unions and employees to work through this difficult situation together,” said Schram.</p>

      <p>Jettainer received has received ‘best service’ award for the second time at the Oman Air Cargo awards at the award gala on March 4 in Muscat, Oman.</p>
      <p>“We are very pleased that we were able to convince with our work again. Receiving the award for the second time in a row underlines our excellent relationship with Oman Air Cargo,” comments Thomas Sonntag, CEO of Jettainer GmbH.</p>
      <p>Oman Air outsourced the ULD management to Jettainer in October 2017. The market leader has a dedicated team in Abu Dhabi and Muscat, which manages just under 20.000 standard and special ULDs for international airlines in the Middle Eastern region. In 2019, Jettainer has increased Oman Air’s ULD fleet by about 20% to support their future growth strategy. Jettainer’s regional office also operates the order management of temperature-controlled containers, which requires a high level of expertise as these are managed differently from standard ULDs.</p>
      <p>“We thank our co-operators for the outstanding work in 2019. With Jettainer, we can count on a reliable partner for over two years already and we are looking forward to a fruitful long-term cooperation,” commented Mohammed Al Musafir, SVP at Oman Air Cargo.</p>

      <p>“We have taken significant measures to protect our crew members and ground ops teams against COVID-19. We are ready and geared to grow with our customers in mainland China as we can deliver what they expect from the carrier, the extra mile on ground and beyond” Offer Gilboa, Challenge Group controlling owner has said.</p>

    <content>
      <p>What’s your reaction to winning this award?I am very surprised and terribly honoured for this. Honoured, because I have put in so many years into cargo business and I love the cargo business.  So, to be recognised by STAT Times is truly a privilege. But once again, I wouldn’t receive this if I didn’t have a team of great people around me to provide me the environment to flourish. So it is really not about me; it is about the whole team, particularly Air Canada Cargo.</p>
      <p>Can you pick some key highlights of your career that spans four decades?I really fell into the airlines industry by happenstance. I was a university student and I was looking for a part time summer job. I got a job in the airline industry and I never left because, they talked about having the bug, and I had the big very seriously. I was very fortunate to have the experience in the passenger as well as the cargo departments. I must say my career is split half. But it is really the last latter part of my career that was in cargo. I found it to be a challenging environment. It is always changing; there has never been one day the same as the next. For me, cargo was wonderful. I had the opportunity to work for two airlines in my career. I was with Air France where I did passenger and cargo and latter half of my career was with Air Canada working both in passenger and cargo divisions. So they were both tremendous schools and I had the privilege of working overseas so getting to know different cultures and understanding different markets and how people react. This was really helpful to me. And in cargo I also had the privilege of working the operations, which was probably one of the best things to have happened to me. Because it allowed me to learn really about what cargo is all about. Not just the commercial part,  but how do things move; what you need to do to enable the movement of goods, depending on what types of product you are moving, etc. That was a turning point for me. So moves can be lateral but being lateral you gain breadth and that is the opportunity I had by being able to go from sales to cargo operations. From there eventually I took on more senior roles to finally become the vice president of cargo at Air Canada. So I had a good understanding of the commercial part of the business but also a very in-depth understanding of the operations. I think the two together really enabled to make hopefully good decisions.</p>
      <p>How connected are you with the air cargo industry now?I haven’t disconnected completely because I do watch things at a distance. It is interesting. I don’t have my hand on the pulse. I am at a distance. But I do look at it because I am interested in world economy and world trade; so automatically I am interested in what’s happening in the cargo world.</p>
      <p>What keeps you busy now in the retired life?I think certainly travel and reconnecting with family and friends which has been wonderful. I now have more time to be, what I call ‘a little bit more civilised, little bit more patient and tolerant and what not’ because I think when you are so tied up in your work sometimes you lose sight of things that you should be doing. So I am trying to reconnect to that. One of the areas that interest me at the end of my career was helping women. Not just women in Canada or that I was in contact with but also women in the world at large. What can we do to make sure that women who are from underprivileged areas rise and make a difference. So I became involved in helping out an organisation in Canada that looks at raising funds to provide higher education for women in Sub Sahara Africa. A lot of women that we helped are women who come from very poor environment. We have identified women who are bright and have the desire to break through the poverty cycle and to invest time in studying and become leaders of their families or their communities.</p>
      <p>You are someone who held very senior leadership positions in industry organisations. What are your thoughts on attracting new talent into air cargo industry and gender diversity?Unfortunately, air cargo industry is not very well known by the public. We don’t deal with the end consumer, we deal with middle men. And so we are invisible unlike the passenger world. What we do is almost hidden. And I guess that is the biggest challenge. We do need to tap into more talent. The industry needs bright minds who have solutions, who are going to find ways to help us keep this industry progressing at a faster pace. One of my frustrations with the industry is that it is so slow to move. There are reasons for that. In an airline you (cargo) are sort of at the low end of the pecking order, sometimes for getting capital and make investments. Having said that, the industry needs to find a way to tap into talent and that talent should not to be restricted to only one gender. The more we have the better we will succeed in attracting that talent. I think with the universities we had started looking at that. Going out to educational institutions to try and highlight what this industry is about. It is fascinating when you think about it. We have our finger on the pulse of world trade, you know, if you look at what’s going in the world right now, people are going to start feeling the repercussions of what’s going on with this coronavirus. The current crisis will impact air cargo and disrupt the flow of goods in general and eventually will impact the consumers. So this is the time when that would become more evident. Therefore, we need to have people who have solutions to find alternatives on what do we do in such instances? So, it is important to have the word out on all the fascinating jobs that are available in cargo. You know there is sales, commercial, marketing, finance, operations, it is so vast. It is an airline within an airline. It has all the opportunity to attract anyone and I think women are absolutely capable and apt in if they would be interested in it.</p>
      <p>What’s your advice to air cargo professional and those wanting to join the industry?That is a tall question. But I guess the more we talk about the industry the more we build awareness. We take both men and women in the industry to go out and try and attract talent into the industry. And once again it shouldn’t be difficult in that we have so many fascinating areas of the business in which one could be involved. Someone may have an IT background, and guess what; there is a lot of IT going on in cargo. It could be in finance, sales or marketing. I think, the wonderful part about the cargo industry, which I really enjoy, was that it is really a small industry, relative to the airline industry. You will get to know everybody. That is fun too. You build relationships and you are able to not only work at something you love but also with people that you enjoy and with whom you can connect.</p>

      <p>By safely bringing the air cargo community together in the midst of the unfortunate coronavirus outbreak, Air Cargo India 2020 successfully set a platform for the industry to gauge the prevailing crises and discuss on resilient programs and services that could alleviate the impacts of current situation and other challenges being faced by the air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>Vandana Aggarwal, economic adviser to the Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation, opened the gates to the exhibition hall and inaugurated the 8th edition of the Air Cargo India event, which took place at the Grand Hyatt Hotel Mumbai, India from 25 to 27 February. Gerhard Gerritzen, deputy managing director of Messe Muenchen, underscored his optimism in the welcome note by declaring that the “Air cargo in India has a lot of potential.” R K Patra, group editor-in-chief of STAT Media Group, lauded the spirit of the cargo community which had gathered for the 3-day event despite the circumstances encircling the coronavirus epidemic.</p>
      <p>Aggarwal, in her keynote address, informed the air cargo community about India’s current position with respect to exports and imports tonnage, and pointed out the existing discrepancies between Indian and global supply chain.</p>
      <p>Aggarwal stressed on the government’s interest to encourage the development of digital infrastructure around trades and highlighted a special case of digital corridor between Mumbai airport, India and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by urging the parties involved to put the corridor in operation during the current fiscal year. She also invited airports from Singapore and Germany by announcing that “We are ready to partner to create digital airport corridor.”</p>
      <p>While highlighting the needed digital infrastructural initiatives to increase the Indian air cargo capacity, Aggarwal pointed out the drag of nascent Indian maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) industry on the air cargo capacity. She complained that “India’s air cargo has not taken off because inventory required to carry out the expensive MRO is being done out of India.” India is one of the youngest countries and has one of the largest pools of engineers. Aggarwal, entrusting the new business, assured that “MRO can be 30 percent cheaper in India compared to other countries.”</p>
      <p>India is clearly a growing market and stands second when it comes to exports of fruits, vegetables, dairy products. Focusing her attention on agri logistics through air, Aggarwal talked about government policies that are focused on agri logistics through air, like ‘Krishi Udan Yojana’, a scheme which aims to facilitate transportation of agricultural goods through air, and said that the “Demand is there and supply is there but somewhere the logistics is failing.” She added, “Logistics needs to catch up.”</p>
      <p>Air Cargo India 2020 saw participation of more than 65 panel members for its conference sessions, contributing insights on various topics across various panel discussions. Each panel discussion had a blend of dynamic panel members that not only discussed their company trends but also provided insights on services that could be made better across the supply chain.</p>
      <p>Digitalisation making the chain transparentPanel discussion on the subject of the ‘State of digitalistion in the air cargo industry’ underscored the importance of transparency through digitalising operations across value chain. Stories on how the implementations of key performance indicators (KPIs), electronic data interchange (EDI) and paperless exchange of information between all the stockholders in the chain are endowing customers with the desired transparency, making the processes more sustainable and bringing more trust into the business. With investments accelerating the development of sophisticated digital infrastructure, services are getting standardised, allowing the industry to process huge amounts of data for inspection and making the process more economic.</p>
      <p>Perishable goods need more attentionOn the subject of ‘setting standards and building capacity for transport and logistics of perishable goods’, the panel put forth key challenges faced during the transportation of perishable goods—from harvesting and sorting of goods to packaging and handling of shipments. The panel raised concerns of India perishable goods not keeping with the global standards and highlighted concerns pertaining to specialised requirements of the product for packaging and sorting. Taking points from keynote presented by Aggarwal, the panel members shared their practical insights on the trade modifications being implemented due to the new Krishi Udan Yojana. The exports of Indian perishable goods are thriving to grow and, for now, this expected growth is certainly pushing the industry to focus more on sophisticated utilisation of existing resources.</p>
      <p>Co-creating pharma supply chainAir freight industry has come together like never before to uplift the exports of pharmaceutical products. India is one of the key exporters of temperature sensitive products and the pharma market’s momentum is forcing the industry to rapidly accommodate its esoteric shipment requirements. The panel discussion, which involved members from airlines, airports, pharmaceutical corporations, cargo handling companies and equipment and instrument manufacturers, emphasised on the collaborative efforts needed for the cold chain to remain intact throughout the supply chain. The role of data in obtaining full transparency of the shipment was discussed and technologies like blockchain, AI were seen as the tool to achieve the much needed transparency.</p>
      <p>Air cargo for ecommerce logistics— enabling and delivering global tradeAir cargo volume for ecommerce has consistently seen double-digit growth and considering the current market, it aspires to sustain the current growth trajectory. Without boxing the ecommerce sector to operations of giants like Amazon, Shopify etc., the panel members acknowledged the broadly categorised sector and spoke about regulatory and warehousing requirements, cross border shipment challenges, digital regulation and cutting edge technologies that are coming to fore. Digital regulation stirred the panel into discussing the regulations surrounding single window clearance. With China having already implemented single window clearance, also called as free trade zone, at around 15 areas within the country, it may serve Indian regulatory bodies as a good case to study and equip them with new ways to nudge the ecommerce sector to a pace that is truly global. The panel members made a point that such free trade zones in India will dramatically reduce regulatory footprint off of many products that sellers are reluctant on dealing with. Cross border challenge concerning imports was one of the important highlights of the discussion along with issues pertaining to licensing and clearances. The members concluded the panel by effectively pointing out the needed reforms at the airports and customs agencies.</p>
      <p>Discussions on subjects like trade tension drag on air cargo and building resilience; India as promising air cargo export region; airports of the future for special cargo commodities; and transportation support for the digital comprehensively voiced the impacts of coronavirus on trade and ensuing exports and imports modulations being made due to trade regulations adjustments.

      <p>Luxembourg Airport has engaged Nallian, a specialist of collaborative solutions in logistics and air cargo based in Belgium, to implement a cargo community system (CCS) at the airport.</p>
      <p>The CCS represents an important component of the Luxembourg Single Window for Logistics program and will be set up as a neutral IT platform, open to all actors involved in international trade. Enabling real-time capturing and sharing of granular information regarding shipment processing, far beyond the traditional cargo data, it will empower all stakeholders involved to better plan and execute their processes and will drive efficiency and visibility with in-depth insights in performance.</p>
      <p>In a first implementation phase in 2020, the application shall prove its operability and added value for the cargo community. Upon the successful run of perishables and live animals shipments with a limited number of involved actors, namely Cargolux, LuxairCargo, Kuehne+Nagel, Arthur Welter and the public administrations concerned, the CCS shall be rolled out to all types of cargo and all companies that are interested to join.</p>
      <p>René Steinhaus, CEO of lux-Airport said, “lux-Airport is excited to implement, together with its cargo community, a data sharing platform. With this decision lux-Airport demonstrates its commitment to support the airport cargo community and to foster the competitiveness and further growth of Luxembourg as a European multimodal logistics hub. Nallian has been selected because their solution demonstrates their core competence in cargo communities, using best practice processes frameworks, and enables for integration with other cargo communities.”</p>
      <p>Jean Verheyen, CEO of Nallian said, “We are proud to have been selected by lux-Airport, with whom we share a common vision on the importance and power of digitization and data sharing for air cargo. We are excited to help them realize their ambition to further develop the competitiveness of the airport and the logistics sector in Luxembourg as a whole.”</p>

      <p>Portugal's flagship carrier TAP Air Portugal (TAP) and air cargo e-booking platform cargo.one have entered into a global partnership. The agreement will support the rapid growth of TAP’s cargo business by introducing new digital capabilities such as online distribution and dynamic pricing. The partnership will also reinforce operational efficiency and day-to-day service quality of the airline.</p>
      <p>Miguel de Paiva Gomes, global chief cargo officer, of TAP said, “Our cargo business has grown by 17 percent over 12 months and joining cargo.one is the next big step to continue our growth path. Over the past year, we have added 30 new aircrafts and have grown our network to +90 online and +250 offline destinations. cargo.one offers the most comprehensive service combined with the best user experience. By integrating with the experienced technology player, we will effectively extend our reach in key cargo markets and serve existing customers in the best possible way.”</p>
      <p>For cargo.one, the partnership is another major win to solidify its position as the go-to platform for freight forwarders to digitally book air cargo capacities. The ever-growing customer base of the e-booking platform will gain additional access on routes to Latin and North America, as well as Africa.</p>
      <p>Moritz Claussen, managing director of cargo.one said, “At cargo.one we strive to work with the most forward-thinking airlines around the globe. TAP Air Cargo has an outstanding team, that has shown foresight to embrace technology in order to drive growth and to put its customers first. We are delighted that the TAP Air Cargo team has selected cargo.one to help drive their extraordinary growth and transformation.”</p>
      <p>In addition to reaching cargo.one’s customers the partnership will also provide TAP Air Cargo with a faster channel to market for new cargo products.</p>
      <p>“We are increasingly interested in providing new cargo products to our customers and will leverage cargo.one as a distribution channel for those. The platform represents an excellent channel for effectively marketing products to freight forwarders with fast lead times, better exposure, and less complicated processing than with traditional channels. Time to market is absolutely critical to us, as we understand that together with excellent access, and unique user  experience these are key attributes towards complete customer centricity” says Bernardo Nunes, Product and Services Senior Manager of TAP Air Cargo.</p>
      <p>The integration work to connect TAP’s core cargo system to cargo.one is in progress and the launch of TAP capacities on cargo.one is anticipated for Q2 2020 in major European cargo markets.</p>

      <p>On the occasion of International Women’s Day, Dubai-based airline Emirates released a video that follows an all-women flight deck crew operate multi-stop cargo flights across four continents on Emirates SkyCargo’s Boeing 777 freighter aircraft.</p>
      <p>Captain Ellen Roz from the United States and First Officer Heidi McDiarmid from Australia cover close to 30,000kms in 10 days on five freighter flights from Frankfurt to Mexico City onwards to Quito, Aguadilla, Amsterdam and finally to Dubai transporting over 300 tonnes of cargo ranging from fresh flowers and fruits to pharmaceuticals. The two pilots were also joined by Captain Heather Wolf from Canada for operating the flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Women in EmiratesWomen constitute more than 40 percent of the total workforce at Emirates with the majority working as cabin crew. Emirates’ female pilots come from over 30 nationalities, covering an age range from 23 to 62 years. Women from over 160 nationalities, including more than 1,100 Emiratis, are employed across the Emirates Group in operational roles in functions including flight operations, engineering, aircraft maintenance and appearance, catering, cargo and ramp operations; in customer facing roles in airport services, sales and customer affairs and corporate roles across business support functions.</p>
      <p>“From the very start, Emirates’ success story has been powered to a large extent thanks to the hard work and talent of our female employees across all our business functions. On the occasion of International Women’s Day we celebrate their immense achievement not just at Emirates but within the global aviation industry. We are happy and proud that our multinational women employees act as trail blazers in connecting the world and also as role models encouraging women and girls everywhere to pursue careers in aviation,” said Abdulaziz Al Ali, executive vice president of Human Resources at Emirates Group.</p>
      <p>Freighter OperationsUnlike operations for flying passengers, Emirates’ freighter flights are dedicated to transporting cargo and do not always originate and end in Dubai. Instead, the flights cover multiple origins and destinations over rotations that last several days. This allows for additional flexibility in cargo operations along with the ability to rapidly and efficiently cargo from where it is produced to markets where it is required by customers.</p>
      <p>Additionally Emirates’ freighter aircraft also operate to destinations that are not covered by passenger flights. Ecuador, for example, is one of the largest flower producing markets in the world and is a cargo-only destination on Emirates’ global network. Emirates’ freighter aircraft transport fresh cut flowers from Quito to Amsterdam via Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. This ensures that the flowers are transported more rapidly from Ecuador to the Netherlands than if the flight had to travel to Dubai and then proceed onwards from Dubai to Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>Over 75 tonnes of fresh flowers were transported on the freighter flights operated by Captain Roz and First Officer McDiarmid from Quito to Aguadilla and from Aguadilla to Amsterdam. Emirates’ freighter flights from Quito create a direct channel for exports for the Ecuadorian floriculture industry to Amsterdam, the world’s largest flower distribution hub. This supports the local economy in Ecuador and the livelihoods of over 100,000 people in the country who work to cultivate and harvest flowers.</p>
      <p>Freighter flights also allow for rapid transportation of goods such as lifesaving medication from the location where they are manufactured to patients who may urgently need them for treatment. Close to 10 tonnes of valuable pharmaceuticals were transported on the freighter flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City operated by the all-women flight deck crew.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo operates scheduled freighter flights to over 40 global destinations every week. In addition, Emirates’ Boeing 777 freighter aircraft also execute a number of on-demand charter operations for clients to deliver a range of commodities from outsized machinery to relief materials. In 2019, Emirates SkyCargo operated over 300 charter operations globally.</p>

      <p>IATA’s January 2020 global air freight report saw a decrease of 3.3% in demand, measured in cargo tonne kilometers (CTKs), compared to the same period in 2019. Cargo capacity, measured in available cargo tonne kilometers (ACTKs), rose by 0.9% year-on-year in January 2020. Capacity growth has outstripped demand growth for 21 consecutive months.</p>
      <p>The report showed that the airlines in Asia-Pacific and Europe suffered sharp declines in year-on-year growth in total air cargo volumes, while North American and Middle East carriers experienced a more moderate decline. Latin America and Africa were the only regions to record growth in air freight demand compared to January 2019.</p>
      <p>Asia-Pacific airlines saw demand for air cargo contract by 5.9% in January 2020, compared to the year-earlier period. This records the sharpest drop in freight demand of any region for the month. Capacity growth was flat. Seasonally-adjusted cargo demand rose slightly however, following the thawing of US-China trade relations. The impact from COVID-19 is expected to affect February’s performance.</p>
      <p>North American airlines saw demand decrease by 1.3% in January 2020, compared to the same period a year earlier. Capacity increased by 3.4%. Seasonally-adjusted cargo demand rose slightly however, amid a more supportive operating environment and following the thawing of US-China trade relations.</p>
      <p>European airlines posted a 3.7% decrease in cargo demand in January 2020 compared to the same period a year earlier – more than double the 1.3%% drop in year-on-year demand in December. Seasonally-adjusted demand also dropped sharply, disrupting the positive trend that started mid-2019. Capacity decreased by 3.0% year-on-year.</p>
      <p>Middle Eastern airlines’ cargo volumes decreased 1.4% in January 2020 compared to the year-ago period. Capacity increased by 2.9%. Against a backdrop of operational and geopolitical challenges facing some of the region’s key airlines, seasonally-adjusted freight volumes ticked down in January, but a modest upwards trend has been sustained. However, given the Middle East’s position connecting trade between China and the rest of the world, the region’s carriers have significant exposure to the impact of COVID-19 in the period ahead.</p>
      <p>Latin American airlines experienced an increase in freight demand in January 2020 of 1.4% compared to January 2019 – reversing the 2.5% decrease in December. Seasonally-adjusted freight volumes in the region also ticked upwards, underpinned by new route connections, which is a positive development for the region’s carriers. Capacity increased by 2.4% year-on-year.</p>
      <p>African carriers posted the fastest growth of any region for the 11th consecutive month in January 2020, with an increase in demand of 6.8% compared to the same period a year earlier. Growth on the smaller Africa-Asia trade lanes (up 12.4% in 2019) contributed to the positive performance. Capacity grew 5.9% year-on-year.</p>
      <p>”January marked the tenth consecutive month of year-on-year declines in cargo volumes. The air cargo industry started the year on a weak footing. There was optimism that an easing of US-China trade tensions would give the sector a boost in 2020. But that has been overtaken by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has severely disrupted global supply chains, although it did not have a major impact on January’s cargo performance. Tough times are ahead. The course of future events is unclear, but this is a sector that has proven its resilience time and again,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO.</p>
      <p>It is unlikely that the COVID-19 outbreak had very much to do with January’s weak performance. The Lunar New Year in 2020 was earlier than in 2019. This skewed 2020 numbers towards weakness as many Chinese manufacturers would be closed for the holiday period. February performance will give a better picture of how COVID-19 is impacting global air cargo.</p>

      <p>Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) reported that an individual associated with an ANC cargo flight tested positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The patient, who is a foreign national, developed a fever and respiratory symptoms soon after arriving in Anchorage on March 11. After contacting the physician, the patient was sent to Alaska Regional Hospital for testing.</p>
      <p>The airport states that cargo flights strictly adhere to guidelines set out by the US Federal Aviation Administration and the US Department of Health and Human Services. “Cargo flights are completely separate from any passenger flights at ANC. Cargo crewmembers never come into contact with general passengers and they do not access the main terminal. Cargo crewmembers are cleared through US Customs and Border Protection agents at ANC’s North Terminal,” asserted the airport authorities through a media release.</p>
      <p>Cargo is not considered a health risk according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the CDC’s 2019 Novel Coronavirus website as it becomes available.</p>

      <p>UPS has a new chief executive officer and she is Carol Tomé. David Abney, the current chairman and chief executive officer, will hold his position until June 1 when he will take on the role of executive chairman of the Board. He will retire from the UPS Board on September 30 after 46 years of service.</p>
      <p>However, Abney will remain a special consultant until the end of 2020 so as to ensure a smooth transition. On September 30, William Johnson, who is UPS’ lead independent director, will become the non-executive chairman.</p>
      <p>“After a rigorous selection process involving both internal and external candidates, Carol was the clear choice,” said Johnson. Johnson also serves as chair of the UPS Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and is a member of the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p>“Carol is one of the most respected and talented leaders in Corporate America and has a proven track record of driving growth at a global organization, maximizing shareholder value, developing talent and successfully executing against strategic priorities,” said Johnson. “As a member of the Board and Chair of the Audit Committee, Carol has in-depth knowledge of UPS’s business, strategy and people, and is the right executive to lead the company at this important time in its transformation.”</p>
      <p>Johnson continued, “We congratulate David on a truly exceptional career at UPS. He has undertaken bold actions to place UPS at the forefront of the transportation industry and position its global network and people to capitalize on emerging trends that will carry the company well into the future.”</p>
      <p>“UPS has been one of my life’s passions and through UPS I have been able to live the American dream,” said David Abney. “I am proud to have worked with UPSers to prepare this great company for its next 100 years. I am confident in the UPS management team and their capabilities to execute our strategies in the future. This is the right time for me to pass the baton. I am extremely pleased for Carol and know she is the best choice to lead the company. She understands UPS’s culture and values, is a strategic leader and possesses a customer-first mindset.”</p>
      <p>“I look forward to working with and further developing the talented management team and the company’s 495,000 employees to deliver for our customers and shareowners,” Carol Tomé said. “David has led a remarkable transformation at UPS and I plan to build on his success. UPS’s rich culture and commitment to its values will guide us as we continue to lead the industry and build on the company’s already strong foundation.”</p>
      <p>Carol Tomé becomes the 12th chief executive officer in the 113-year history of UPS. She has been a member of the UPS Board of Directors since 2003 and serves as Chairperson of the Audit Committee. Tomé is the former executive vice president and chief financial officer of The Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer in the US with 2,300 stores and 400,000 employees. Her responsibilities included corporate strategy, finance and business development. During her 18-year tenure as CFO, she is credited with helping to deliver a 450 percent increase in The Home Depot’s shareholder value.</p>
      <p>Abney was appointed CEO in 2014 and as Chairman in 2016.  Under his leadership, UPS has seen 27 percent increase in revenue while adjusted net income grew close to 50 percent. The company also raised adjusted earnings per share by nearly 60 percent. Abney previously served as Chief Operating Officer since 2007, overseeing logistics, sustainability, engineering and all facets of the UPS transportation network. Before serving as COO, he was president of UPS International, leading the company's strategic initiative to increase its global logistics capabilities. During his career, he was also involved in a number of global acquisitions that included Coyote, Marken, the Fritz Companies, Sonic Air, Stolica, Lynx Express, and Sino-Trans in China. He began his UPS career in 1974 as a package handler in a small facility in Greenwood, Mississippi, while attending Delta State University.</p>

      <p>Airports across the world are looking to transform themselves into cargo hubs. How can Air Cargo Community Systems help?Airports play a very important role in the logistics value chain. These are the hubs of commercial activities and as one of the studies have revealed in the past the air cargo spends more time at the airport for processing and clearing than actually flying which is the core value that the end customer expects.</p>
      <p>Most airports across the world have been traditionally operating a “land-lord” or a “concession” model regarding the air cargo and have thus far kept an arm's length from the core operations or growth of cargo unlike some other airports who have been deeply involved in promotion as well as operations of air cargo. However, times are changing now. With increasing competition, pressure from regulators around security, pressure for creating Trade Facilitation infrastructure to comply with the WTO's Trade Facilitation agreements, the need to increase economic activity and create more jobs; the airport's involvement in the core cargo business is increasing now.</p>
      <p>In order to address the above and ensure customer satisfaction so that the stakeholders are motivated to bring cargo to their airports, the airports have to create next generation digital infrastructure for cargo. We call it creating the “Airport Single Window” for airport's stakeholders that will help in trade facilitation. This is also like building an Air Cargo Community around the airport. The true next generation Airport Cargo Community systems do exactly that for the airports.</p>
      <p>The general expectation is having an ACS will solve all current problems. How true is this statement? Does it make internal automation systems irrelevant?Since supply chain by definition extends beyond the enterprise, having just good IT systems for automation of cargo handling activities is not sufficient. There are serious inefficiency and transparency issues in the supply chain although a lot of stakeholders have their own automation systems in place. Let me give you an example. An MNC forwarder has a world class system, a multinational handling company has a world class system as well.</p>
      <p>However, in the absence of an airport community system, the handler doesn't know how many trucks to expect when and this often leads to congestion and higher dwell times at the airport. This is just one simple case. We have identified around 100 such use cases of a community system which will give you the scale of the problems that can be solved by such single windows. Internal systems are relevant but not sufficient in making the air cargo industry more efficient. The need for effectively connecting to the stakeholders can't be understated.</p>
      <p>Has digitalisation helped stakeholders cut their operating expenses and improve bottom-line?This is very simple to understand. With air cargo community systems, through advance data exchange stakeholders have been able to reduce waiting times at the airports, there's no need to run from pillar to post for shipment processing, there's reduction in duplicate data entry, reduced paper work, reduced mal-practices, better transparency across the supply chain all causing reduced operating expenses and this reduction goes directly to improve the bottom-line. I am personally extremely excited about the proliferation of such community platforms and I believe the industry will change forever with the next generation airport cargo community systems.</p>

      <p>Aerospace logistics provider B&amp;H Worldwide has won a new contract of managing the logistics of aircraft spare parts and engine materials for AOG Technics, a leading independent specialists in the aviation industry, in Germany.</p>
      <p>While both entities have had a previous work relationship for exports to Europe and the USA from the UK, this will be their debut partnership in mainland Europe.  B&amp;H Worldwide's Frankfurt facility will be responsible for storing, dispatching and repacking parts before dispatch with immediate effect. Aero engine blades will be among the top products that will be handled.</p>
      <p>The products from Frankfurt will move to multiple global destinations including the USA, Europe and Asia.  One of the main reasons for AOG Technics’ decision to locate with B&amp;H was Frankfurt being a gateway to Europe and the frequency of international flights to other global hubs.</p>
      <p>Seth Profit, B&amp;H Worldwide's group sales director said, “The location of our Frankfurt office at Cargo City has shown our customers we can provide them with a Forward Stocking Location where they can strategically position inventory in the heart of Europe and we are delighted to welcome AOG Technics to the facility”.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for AOG Technics said, “We are proud of our reputation for providing excellent service and a rapid response 24 hours a day.  We decided to partner with B&amp;H in order to expand our markets and host our inventories in other locations worldwide”.</p>

      <p>IBS Software, global IT solutions provider to the global travel industry, has signed a five-year contract with Lufthansa Cargo AG (LCAG), to take full ownership of the hosting and maintenance of Lufthansa Cargo’s iCAP cargo handling application platform, which is powered by IBS Software’s iCargo cargo management platform.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo’s decision to move to IBS Software’s SaaS hosting platform is part of its long-term objective to focus on its core cargo business without compromising on IT operations. As part of the decision-making process, Lufthansa Cargo evaluated the capabilities of global hosting service providers on critical areas including application availability, security regulatory and data privacy.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo stands to benefit from IBS Software’s industry-first ‘zero outage’ capability for its SaaS offering. With zero outage capability, planned maintenance is completed with absolutely no outage to the business IT system – one of the major benefits for Lufthansa Cargo. This unique capability results in operational stability, which is essential to fulfill the customer promise and to provide effective and seamless cargo handling operations around the clock across all time zones without any service disruptions.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo will also benefit from superior and faster application performance of highly complex cargo business functions and processes. As an example, Lufthansa Cargo processes one million messages per day. Each message will now be processed noticeably faster than before in less than one second on the IBS Software SaaS platform.</p>
      <p>Initial performance of the system, which operates from IBS Software’s new data centre in Frankfurt, has shown that the SaaS service has exceeded the benchmarks in all parameters set by Lufthansa Cargo, with 100 percent SLA compliance.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo CIO Dr. Jochen Göttelmann said, “IBS Software has consistently delivered beyond expectations throughout our relationship that started with the iCAP implementation. They have demonstrated their capability to take on the established leaders in application hosting and offer a true SaaS provisioning that helps us to focus on our core competencies. We greatly value the responsibility and commitment that IBS Software brings to the table.”</p>
      <p>“IBS Software is thrilled to sign up Lufthansa Cargo as a SaaS customer, benefitting from our industry leading iCargo platform hosted in our world class data centres. Lufthansa Cargo’s selection of IBS Software is testament to our excellent track record of iCAP delivery for the past seven years, and our commitment to consistently deliver value to our customers,” said Ashok Rajan, SVP and head of airline cargo services, IBS Software.</p>

      <p>The demand for improved predictability and end-to-end visibility of shipments in transit has never been more significant to the air cargo industry. While there have been notable strides in the adoption of technology with initiatives such as e-freight and digital cargo, digitalisation still remains a challenge with just over one million of e-AWBs used for freight operations by select airlines as of October 2019.</p>
      <p>The digitalisation journey of the airfreight industry has been a long and challenging one. The e-freight concept was initially launched by IATA in 2006 as part of the StB (simplifying the business) programme and became an industry-wide initiative. With more than 30 paper documents being handled for each shipment, the goal established 14 years ago by the e-freight program was to cut delivery cycle times by 24 hours, accelerate and enhance track-and-trace processes and eliminate nearly 8,000 tonnes of paper documents annually – the equivalent of 80 Boeing 747 freighters filled with paper!</p>
      <p>A typical consignment booked by a forwarder and shipped onto an aircraft takes nearly five to six days to reach its consignee, while the time it takes to reach the destination market is less than a day. The rest of the time is often spent in customs formalities and clearance or hung up in the web that includes ground handlers, customs brokers, truckers and importers. This dwell time totally nullifies the benefits of air freight for which a shipper usually pays a premium.</p>
      <p>It is a no-brainer then that digitalization of documentation and the processes will increase the efficiencies in tracking of goods and data exchanges between airlines, trucking companies, forwarders and shippers. It will also reduce costs and delays and ease security compliance and customs clearance issues, leading to an overall improved customer service. The biggest win will be in speed and quality of information exchange, which will happen effectively in real time. Some stakeholders have jumped on the bandwagon however there is still reluctance among some of them to opt for digitalisation of their processes, and that, will only make air freight less attractive to customers.</p>
      <p>“Digitalisation is something that we have talked as an industry for far too long but didn’t really demonstrate the absolute commitment to delivering it. But now, people are investing in the technology and they are committed to working with their partners because there is a certain realization that if we continue to do as we have been doing for the last 3-4 decades, we are going to lose the shippers. We are going to lose the confidence of the e-commerce players, those shipping high value pharma – they want to have access to the information of their shipments throughout the journey. When things go wrong, they want to hear about it when they go wrong and not after the journey has concluded,” explained Glyn Hughes, global head of cargo, IATA.</p>
      <p>“It has taken us such a long time to come to at least reasonable penetration of eAWBs. We are taking a lot of time for it and the reason for that is that there are so many parties involved and it is difficult to get each and everybody on the same level. Only when the end-to-end functionality works, everyone stands to gain,” reasoned Dorothea von Boxberg, member of the executive board and chief commercial officer at Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>“In the increasingly competitive air cargo industry, the whole ecosystem – spanning airlines, warehouses, freight forwarders, booking agents, customs and road/rail transport – must accelerate its digital transformation, to be more efficient, and remain economically viable, as well as enable new business models and better secure the data and goods that are in its care. Some players have made great strides in adopting new technologies, from online marketplaces, to IoT and drones. However, for most of the industry, a fundamental cultural change is required to evolve and create a truly connected supply chain, where stakeholders can work together to share inventory and securely share data with only those who need it,” says Niranjan Navaratnarajah, cargo industry director, Unisys Asia Pacific.</p>
      <p>Unisys’ cargo solutions are used by many leading carriers, who collaborate via the Unisys Cargo User Group (UCUG). Unisys and UCUG members have worked with IATA for more than 20 years on initiatives such as e-Freight, Cargo iQ and XML messaging.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ashok Rajan, senior vice president, IBS Software feels that with the industry being siloed and fragmented, information gets lost between the tracks.  IBS’ mission is to show how airlines can transform themselves into modern, digital enterprises. “It is a three-layered strategy – the first is to get the right platform in place where you can start to work on digitisation. Second is to help people make use of the tool. While we run Centres of Excellence on Artificial Intelligence, we work with our customers in making best use of this platform. The third layer of strategy that we are looking is to build collaboration platforms,” explains Ashok Rajan, IBS. Rajan goes on to say that the company is now working on getting together a series of industry platforms which will help airlines collaborate together when they do joint ventures, and where airlines can talk to their ground handlers seamlessly.</p>
      <p>Getting digitally readySeveral factors could explain the slow adoption of e-AWBs. The primary factor could be the lack of standardization across platforms making communication difficult. The other is the lack of initiative on the part of the stakeholders. Government regulations that require data targeting for security purposes will make it essential to digitise airway bill information for security and trade compliance.</p>
      <p>“To go towards a fully integrated digital network of notes, where each note represents an air cargo player, there are different steps to be taken.  Today, we still have air cargo companies with multiple Excel files, piles of paper and huge archives and are scanning documents, and think that is digitalisation. First of all, we need in-house improvements to make (our) company digitally ready,” believes Sara van Gelder, cargo digital development manager at Brussels Airport. Sara was speaking at a panel discussion on digital cargo strategies at the Cargo Facts EMEA 2020 in Frankfurt held earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Digitalisation is now creating a new value proposition and customer demands are increasing with the industry’s two most promising growth markets, e-commerce and temperature-sensitive goods such as pharmaceuticals and perishables.</p>
      <p>Some digitally focused air carriers such as Lufthansa Cargo, Emirates SkyCargo, Air France KLM and logistic companies have already adopted the e-AWB standard and have created their own APIs to process some advanced digital information. Others are trying to catch up in this dynamic environment where unfortunately a digital industry standard is still missing.</p>
      <p>“At Lufthansa Cargo, we really feel digitalisation can make a really big difference to the industry so that the industry can become a lot more efficient, a lot more transparent and also a lot easier to work in. We make a lot of effort across all areas of air freight to become digital. It is about making air freight capacity booking as easy as buying anything else on the Internet,” said Dorothea.</p>
      <p>Dorothea further added that while she is not very happy with the pace of innovation we have had so far, she does see it accelerate. “I think there is a lot more focus on the topic and there are many more partners investing in it. I am really hoping we are getting to the inflection point,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Digitalisation is high on our agenda at Emirates. Admittedly, we still have a long way to go. We still need to get our basics right in digitalisation. As an industry, we are still lagging behind – if you look at the passenger side of the business, you can very quickly get on to an aircraft with a smartphone. But on the cargo side, in most cases, a physical AWB, paper documentation, certificate of origin, and an invoice with a blue stamp on it – these are barriers that we need to address. So for me, it is about working with all the stakeholders in the entire supply chain and how do we embrace the entire digital roadmap. We are working with multiple partners to do that,” explained Dennis Lister, Emirates SkyCargo.</p>
      <p>Lister also informed that Emirates SkyCargo is now working to build a digital corridor between nations. “We are currently working on a project with the Dubai government on how we can build bilateral relations with other countries to get to a point where we have known entities and have verifiable data among the parties that will allow us to bring or move any product out of the country without having to provide any physical document,” he revealed. This development could really be a big game-changer for the industry.</p>
      <p>Data sharing conundrumOne of the biggest hurdles for the industry lies in the reluctance to share data. With different actors involved in the supply chain, each of these only shares intentions and similar related data when it advances their self-interest. They wish to preserve what is seen by them as a competitive edge.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport’s Sara van Gelder explains how the data sharing practice can be encouraged with a good example. “Suppose you download an app like Ways on your mobile – the moment it asks you to share your location, you are hesitant to do so. However, if you realise that if you do share your location, what you get in return is an efficient or a shorter route to reach your workplace, you are very open to share your location. So it is about finding the carrot and the stick to make stakeholders move towards sharing their data. There are a lot of added values that can push stakeholders towards that goal.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, she emphasizes on the presence of a catalyst who can bring all the actors in the supply chain together. “If stakeholder A shares data proactively to stakeholder B, C, D, E who is going to handle the cargo in our very fragmented supply chain, they can optimise their processes. So while it is interesting, it can also become very complex. Because while you put the effort in it to share the data, you are not the one who will take advantage of it but the next stakeholder who gains from it. Therefore, we need a catalyst that can bring those with different points of view to come together,” said Sara van Gelder.</p>
      <p>Creating a standard for data sharingIATA’s ONE Record initiative is the solution to take digitalisation to the next level by creating a standard for data sharing. The initiative allows the creation of a single record view of a shipment through a standardised and secured web API, thus improving the ease and accuracy of accessing the data. The standard is based on mature but progressive data sharing technologies that are well aligned with the best practices used by leading airlines. This makes it directly accessible to IT teams and service providers.</p>
      <p>“The value of the shipments is going up, and therefore, the concern of the shippers that they need to be constantly monitored. They need to have the supply chain interacting with each other. So, ONE Record is designed as the way of taking data that each party owns and sharing it in a smart fashion. So it is not like one party has all the information and then passes it to the next partner. It is actually a platform where in data is shared on a trusted fashion as you have it in small pieces as it allows each party to reflect and respond to in a much bigger way which will help in industry optimization and efficiency,” clarifies Glyn Hughes.</p>
      <p>ONE Record assumes that there will never be a single data model for anything and everything and, instead, focuses on ontologies. An ontology is essentially a “language” with its meanings and rules. The ONE Record ontology describes the language of air cargo. There are, or will be, other ontologies for other freight modes or other parts of the transport chain.</p>
      <p>“ONE Record envisions a digital plug and play world. “Plug” refers to need for system connectivity without any integration. That may sound too good to be true but in the 70s we faced the same challenge for hardware integration. Now we don’t even question whether or not a peripheral will plug into our computer or server. ONE Record aims for the same seamless connectivity between digital companies and their systems,” said Henk Mulder, head of digital cargo, IATA.</p>
      <p>Tackling data breachGoing digital also brings with it challenges such as cyber attacks and data breach. Data captured about the shipper and the shipment is extremely sensitive and is a valuable target for malicious attacks. “To take advantage of ONE Record, security must be balanced with accessibility. Ultimately the customer owns their data – the eAWB, and should only be accessed when needed by those who have the need and authority to do so. In an environment where ransomware, denial of service attacks and human action (either accidental or malicious) can – and will – occur, the industry must move to a Zero Trust approach to security to prevent breaches and isolate and minimize their impact when they happen,” believes Unisys’ Navaratnarajah.</p>
      <p>In February, WISeKey International Holding, a leading global cybersecurity and IoT company, announced that it was selected by International Air Transport Association (IATA) as its technology partner to secure the ONE Record test platform.</p>
      <p>The WISeKey and IATA collaboration for the ONE Record platform aims to define the security layer to protect all data exchanges in the platform, by introducing the necessary technology components for strong authentication and data encryption. WISeKey will provide this security layer by leveraging its Managed PKI Services, allowing the issuance of trusted digital identities under its worldwide recognized Root of Trust, adopting the best practices in secure identity management and enhancing IATA’s ONE Record platform to securely provide paperless processes and creating a plug-and-play environment where companies can connect and re-connect their digital relations with ease, security and trust.</p>
      <p>WISeKey’s technology integration into the IATA ONE Record platform accelerates the Know Your Customer (KYC) process for stakeholders participating in the platform, and WISeKey’s trusted digital certificates to secure P2M (people to machine) and M2M (machine to machine) interactions allow ONE Record operations to be executed within a trusted ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the association, IATA’s Mulder said, “Ensuring data security is a mandatory requirement for the ONE Record data sharing standard that IATA is developing with the air cargo industry. It is also a requirement where we must work with qualified and experienced solution providers, both for the advice on the design of the security layer, but also in the provision of a test platform. WISeKey meets this requirement and we are delighted to work with this experienced and trusted company.”</p>
      <p>Road ahead Faced with the need to reinvent itself, the air cargo industry has gradually adopted digital opportunities with different levels of maturity. Opportunities are countless and initiatives are on the rise; it is up to the industry to take advantage of these digital opportunities that could add value for the shippers, and in turn, improve links with their business partners. This will help carve the digital roadmap for the industry. All air cargo stakeholders need to follow a common goal to reaffirm the competitiveness of their mode of transportation as against other modes, where the adoption of digital technologies is far more progressive.</p>

      <p>The aviation industry is undergoing a breakthrough with women's participation in the sector but the industry experts are not yet satisfied with the percentage of women working in the sector. IATA 25by2025 campaign, which aims to bring 25 percent of women participation across the sector, has created a door of opportunity for women, bringing 59 airlines to join the campaign to date.</p>
      <p>“Women’s inequality should shame us all in the 21st century because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid. Only through the equal participation of women can we benefit from the intelligence, experience, and insights of all of humanity. That is why I call on all men to support women’s rights and gender equality. It’s time to stop trying to change women, and start changing the systems that prevent them from achieving their potential,” cited António Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations during his speech at The New School, New York on the title ‘Women and Power’ on February 27, 2020.</p>
      <p>Recently, at the air cargo India 2020, held in Mumbai from February 25-27, The STAT Trade Times awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award to air cargo industry veteran Lise-Marie Turpin. She began her career in 1975 with a job in passenger &amp; cargo sales and operations at Air France and then continued to serve various positions at Air Canada Cargo as the senior director, managing director, and vice president, until her retirement in 2017.</p>
      <p>On the sidelines of the event, she said, “I was in cargo business for many years and it is a privilege to receive such a prestigious award. I entered the airline business as a university student looking for a part time summer job. Soon I was very fortunate to have experienced passenger as well as cargo world. The cargo side always had a challenging environment. I was constantly looking for new ways to grow and learn. I had the privilege of working overseas (with both the airlines), which developed my understanding of new markets and different cultures.”</p>
      <p>Though retired, Turpin supports the education of girls and higher education of women in developing countries.</p>
      <p>Considering the fact of empowering women to take up leadership roles will lead to the industry’s success, IATA launched a 25by2025 campaign on September 26, 2019. 25by2025 seeks to address gender balance in civil aviation with a minimum representation of 25 percent of women by 2025. Collectively 59 airlines for the campaign have signatories coming from all continents – Europe (36), Asia-Pacific (10), the Americas (7) and Africa &amp; the Middle East (6).</p>
      <p>Observing IATA encouraging women in the field of aviation, Céline Hourcade, project manager, The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) says, “TIACA doesn’t want to duplicate efforts, but rather to amplify them and start initiatives where nothing exist. I applaud IATA’s 25by2025 campaign! With this campaign, IATA wants to raise awareness of gender inequalities and their impacts and encourage airlines to take conscious decisions to bridge the gaps. Diversity and inclusion disparities also apply to other parts of aviation and logistics. As TIACA represents all parts of the air cargo industry, it is well positioned to support IATA’s 25by2025 campaign by spreading the message to shippers, forwarders, handlers, airports, manufacturers, etc.”</p>
      <p>While it comes to American Airlines (AA) Cargo promoting gender balance, Jessica Tyler, vice president, strategy &amp; development states, “American Airlines Cargo has incredible leaders, whose representative proportion happens to be women. Recently, I sat on a panel and looking into the audience I realised that there is only a handful of women in a room of 150 plus people. And, I was the only woman on the panel. I don’t normally notice my environment in that way, but this experience stuck out to me. I think part of why that moment sticks out is because, within American Airlines Cargo, I am constantly surrounded by equality in gender.”</p>
      <p>Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (Hactl) showcases a long tradition of driving gender equality. “Today, in Hactl management, 3 out of 6 of the most senior executives are women. Elsewhere in our business, considering that many of our activities are heavy manual work, the figure is still quite high at 13 percent. What is more significant is that 32 percent of current managerial grades are female, so we are clearly moving towards a better balance. What we are keen not to do, however, is to artificially favour females in internal promotion and recruitment; we believe securing jobs and promotion should be based on an individual’s attitude, qualifications, knowledge, and capabilities. We ensure everyone has equal opportunity, and then it is down to them, regardless of gender,” notes Vivien Lau, executive director of Hactl.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 2019, under Tyler’s leadership, AA Cargo transitioned the business from 90+ systems (some of which were 40 years old) to a single modern platform as part of the broader modernisation effort. She says, “This project is the most complex effort I have been a part of in my nearly 50 years on the planet. The technology effort is enormous. But I have learned that what is just complex is readying us and our minds for a new way of working. We have invested money, time and energy to make sure we are pushing ourselves into the future but the technology is only as good as the team that knows how to leverage it and create great experiences for our customers. Complexity is reduced when you marry great technology with a team that collaborates and stays focused on the customers.”</p>
      <p>Joining TIACA last September as a consultant to define, launch and drive its sustainability agenda, for Hourcade sustainability has always been very high on her agenda, from her IATA days, where she was in charge of IATA Cargo Sustainability Agenda. “My first contribution was to define what we mean by sustainability and what TIACA’s role will be in the industry in regard to sustainability,” she says. The responsibility does not end here for Hourcade who even serves on the international advisory panel of Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone. “I have indeed been appointed as one of the international experts supporting the development strategies of Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport. One of the focuses I am bringing in the discussion is sustainability as a growth factor for the airport.”</p>
      <p>Lau also performs a dual role. Being Hactl’s executive director, she is even the MD of its subsidiary Hong Kong Air Cargo Industry Services Ltd (Hacis). “In Hactl, I am responsible principally for overall commercial strategies, customer relations, and business development, but I am also involved in general business policy and direction, and these are all areas in which soft skills such as business acumen, negotiating, networking and collaboration, etc. are important. The nature of Hactl’s business means that certain aspects of my work also require a technical understanding of the airfreight business and the innovative and tech-based solutions. I had a lot of early support from my operations team which assisted greatly.  In Hacis, I have led the business into new segments such as e-commerce, and expanded its depot network by 50 percent,” she observes.</p>
      <p>TIACA consists of a very small team and to date, it counts 50 percent women. Its governance, board of directors and chairmen council, are largely male dominated to date, which reflects a lack of women at the top of air cargo companies. Hourcade, who worked earlier with IATA and then went on to start Change Horizon, a consulting company last year, will welcome her first colleague soon to build the team. Talking about her new colleague, Hourcade mentions, “She is as passionate as I am with aviation and logistics, and also wants to contribute to making air cargo (and the world) more sustainable and attractive. During my 13 years with IATA, I dedicated a lot of my time to mentoring younger colleagues, mainly women, as I feel it is one way to advance diversity and include progress in the workplace.”</p>
      <p>Looking at gender alone, American Airlines Cargo management is 54 percent male and 46 percent female. Tyler states, “On my direct team, four out of six are female.  However, I believe the best way to build a team is not to focus on one aspect of diversity, but rather to ensure you have differences that cover as much of the human experience as possible. Ensuring opportunity for our leaders to share and talk about what they love about working at American, and specifically, this industry is the best way to motivate women to join this business.”</p>
      <p>Jaisey Yip, associate general manager cargo &amp; logistics development, Changi Airport Group recollects her boss asking, ‘Would you like to pick up a challenge by being the head of cargo and logistics?’ She accepted the challenge and is serving in the role for three years. Yip believes that traditionally this sector was male dominated but now it has been changing.</p>
      <p>Hactl senior management is 50 percent female, while overall female employment is currently 13 percent. Hactl has a very active recruitment and management trainee programme, and this has resulted in 17 percent female uptake. The strong presence of females on the executive role indicates a clear sign that Hactl welcomes females at all levels. And the company’s policy of constant training and promotion from within provides clear career progression.</p>
      <p>Delta Cargo’s managing director – global cargo sales Eric J Wilson says that very few women participate in the decision making process. “We need to increase women's participation in this industry. When I travelled to China and Taiwan, I was very much impressed with the number of women holding senior positions.” At Delta Cargo, there is a circle named She Leads, which is designed to bring more women into managerial roles and Wilson is the executive sponsor for the same. Currently, Delta Cargo’s global sales team has 50 percent female and is aiming to increase those numbers this year.</p>
      <p>Widely known as a conservative economy, UAE’s Emirates SkyCargo worked towards the cause of motivating women in the aviation, which was evident by the appointment of Alyazeya Saeed and Fatma Ahli as cargo managers of Oman and Kuwait, respectively, in 2019. The story continues this year, when the five B777Fs flown by captain Ellen Roz, first officer Heidi McDiarmid, and captain Heather Wolf covering close to 30,000 kilometres, across four continents in 10 days – marked another milestone in the history of Emirates SkyCargo. The flights were operated from Frankfurt to Mexico City onwards to Quito, Aguadilla, Amsterdam and finally to Dubai transporting over 306 tonnes of cargo ranging from fresh flowers, fruits, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>Women constitute more than 40 percent of the total workforce at Emirates with the majority working as cabin crew. Women from over 160 nationalities, including more than 1,100 Emiratis, are employed across the Emirates Group in operational roles in functions including flight operations, engineering, aircraft maintenance &amp; appearance, catering, cargo, ramp operations, among others.</p>
      <p>As per the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law 2020 study, the 10 economies that improved the most were Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nepal, South Sudan, São Tomé and Príncipe, Bahrain, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Jordan, and Tunisia. The study explores the relationship between women’s empowerment and economic outcomes. It found that over time, reforms increasing women’s equality of opportunity contribute to more successful economies, higher female labour force participation, and better development outcomes.</p>
      <p>When queried about multi-tasking skills to navigate ambiguity and complexity to make work ideas great, Tyler depicts an interesting picture. She mentions, “I use the mantra ‘adapt or die’. If you are not constantly evolving and aware of what is happening all around you, you risk not existing any more.  Adapting to industry trends and technology advancements often mean adapting to the challenges that come with the transition, many of which are complex or ambiguous. I believe the key to succeeding is more about willing to change and adjust to new ways of work, rather than how much work you can balance at once. So, maybe the word here should be adaptability, rather than multi-tasking. And that is not gender-specific.”</p>
      <p>Along the similar lines, Lau cites, “It is true that women can sometimes bring a different perspective and that can help any group in reaching a more balanced decision. But that is not just a gender issue: a winning team always comprises people of different character and a strong opinion.”</p>
      <p>With an encouraging piece of advice to women, Tyler concludes, “Follow your talent. Whatever you are good at, whatever those core strengths are that make you unique, the things you naturally do better than others – there’s a place for that talent in any industry. In the aviation and logistics industries, you can apply your talents and have 10 different careers all within the same great organisation. Be open to new applications of your unique strengths. This industry needs a fresh perspective and people who bring their talent to bear on the challenges.”</p>
      <p>Finally, veteran Turpin’s advice to the industry is – ‘without restricting to a particular gender try to tap more talents’.</p>
      <p>The Women, Business and the Law 2020 study estimate that over the last two years, 40 economies from all regions and income groups have made women’s economic empowerment a priority by executing 62 reforms facilitating women’s entry into the workforce. Such reforms allow governments to cultivate a business environment that benefits women entrepreneurs and employees, enhancing economic productivity and accelerating development.</p>

      <p>It is said when China sneezes, the rest of the world catches cold. How true? With Covid-19 originating in Wuhan, claiming several lives and now becoming a global pandemic, China decides to shut its factories to deal with SARS-Cov-2. But the world now suffers not just from Covid-19 but from a severe acute shortage of global supplies. How serious is the issue of excessive reliance on Chinese-built global supply chains and its impact on the global air cargo industry?</p>
      <p>In July 2019, the international research institution, Mckinsey Global Institute published a report named ‘China and the World: Inside the dynamics of a changing relationship’ which in short compares how much China is exposed to the world versus world is exposed to China and analyses potential opportunities and threats due to this relationship.</p>
      <p>The report reads, “The country is becoming less exposed in economic terms to the rest of the world. However, reflecting China’s rise to being the world’s second-largest economy and its leading trading nation, the rest of the world is becoming more exposed to China. Our simulation shows that $22 trillion to $37 trillion of economic value (equivalent to about 15 to 26 percent of global GDP by 2040) could be at stake from less or more engagement between China and the world.”</p>
      <p>The researchers would have never thought that they would get an opportunity to test their premises as fast as in just five months. The outbreak of Covid-19 at the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December 2019 and its eventual spreading into South Asia, Middle East and Europe have kept the global air cargo, and in fact the global economy, at the brink of another recession.</p>
      <p>Right now, close to 40 percent of total cargo capacity has been stripped from the Asia-Europe and Trans-Pacific East Bound (TPEB) tradelanes.</p>
      <p>$30 billion revenue loss for Asia Pacific airlines International Air Transport Association (IATA) in its initial assessment predicted that airlines in the Asia-Pacific will suffer a reduction of $27.8 billion from their revenues. When you close a supply chain for a length of time you then put a financial burden on organizations and companies to continue on a financially strong position. So there is now a heightened risk that the global economy falls into a recession and then it will have an impact on the air cargo industry also.</p>
      <p>Glyn Hughes, global head of cargo, IATA said “When we finished 2019, we came back from 12 months of consecutive industry contraction. We had a forecast over 2 percent growth in 2020 with the ending of trade tensions and signing of the phase-1 trade agreement between the US and China. We were expecting a return to growth this year.”</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, nobody could foresee the impact of what occurred in Wuhan and the coronavirus will have not just on the air cargo industry but, in fact, on the global economy. A number of supply chains have been dramatically affected. China is such a significant component of the global economy that it is impacting every region in the world,” he added.</p>
      <p>Niall van de Wouw, managing director, Clive Data Services (the company that introduced an improved and dynamic methodology to calculate air cargo load factor) said “The situation is unique and the magnitude of its impact on global air cargo is unprecedented. Because China is not only an important market but also the yield obtained by airlines from China is much higher than they could get from other markets. The decrease of airfreight volumes out of China has resulted in the dynamic load factor from Europe &amp; Middle East to China and Hong Kong being higher than the westbound load factor for the first time in 25 years.”</p>
      <p>No belly available  In fact, most passenger airlines have stopped operations to/from China at least until March/April and some have even suspended till May/June thus removing the belly capacity by which Chinese market moved 45 percent of all its cargo.</p>
      <p>Mark Sutch, Regional General Manager – South Asia, Middle East and Africa, Cathay Pacific Airways said “For us, Hong Kong is a huge cargo hub and there has been a significant impact, but one thing to point out is as a multi-carrier, in other words, a cargo operator and a passenger operator, we’ve been able to manage the capacity quite well. We haven’t changed our freighter schedule. Due to the reduction in the belly space capacity, not only by Cathay but also by other airlines, there is a lot of demand for cargo in a limited capacity environment. The freighters are highly utilised.”</p>
      <p>Rippling effect on the air transport network The Covid-19 also had some indirect effect on the economy all world regions and thus reducing the cargo volumes significantly even between countries not affected. As the factories of china are shut inventories of the US and Europe are also depleting. The IATA research has shown that traffic has collapsed on key Asian routes and that this is rippling throughout the air transport network globally, even between countries without major outbreaks of Covid-19.</p>
      <p>Max Conrady, Senior Vice President Cargo, Fraport AG said “We could see an increase in freight and service rates. But they are direct effect; there are also indirect effects of coronavirus like disruptions in the supply chain in Germany. The German car manufactures that rely on electronic parts coming from China are running short of supplies due to factory shutdowns. 25 percent of middle-sized German manufacturers are affected. Export of fabricated goods from Germany is slowing down because the prefabricated goods coming from China are missing.”</p>
      <p>“Automobile, machinery parts, consumer products with reliance on electronic parts are affected. Asia is the largest market for Frankfurt airport especially when it comes to e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and electronic parts. There are many consumer goods imported to china from Germany are also affected. Both the inbound and outbound are affected,” he added.</p>
      <p>Chinese exposure The outbreak has outrightly exposed the overreliance of the global economy on China and its significance for the air cargo industry.  On the last week of February, the United States market witnessed the worst week since the financial crisis of 2008 as Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 fell by 12 percent and investors rushed to dump stocks.</p>
      <p>Companies with more exposure to China, like Apple, Nvidia, Procter &amp; Gamble, Qualcomm and Qorvo, are struggling with production capacity. For example, there is a shortage in iPhone camera lens shipments from the supplier Genius Electronic Optical which will have an effect on the overall production of iPhones.</p>
      <p>Global analysts are now calling out for diversification of exposure which will make companies more resilient to an outbreak like Covid-19. The trade tensions between China and the US have already pushed companies to diversify their production centres to other South Asian countries. However, acceleration of such a trend would mean huge shifts in air cargo routes and market though concerns persist.</p>
      <p>Neel Jones Shah, executive vice president and global head of airfreight, Flexport said, “We’ve seen a rash of supply chain diversification since the start of the US-China trade war. The smart brands are investing heavily in Southeast Asia and minimizing their exposure to China. For example, in a 2019 analysis of Flexport clients, we found year-over-year airfreight volumes from China only increased by single-digit percentages, while airfreight from the Philippines and Vietnam increased by triple and double-digit percentages, respectively.”</p>
      <p>“However, China is still an incredibly important global air cargo market. Compared to neighbouring countries, it has superior logistics infrastructure that’s able to handle the volume and complexity of many products; everything from retail to consumer electronics. Unless you diversified your supply chain prior to Chinese New Year and coronavirus containment practices, there are few current alternatives for shippers moving via airfreight,” he added.</p>
      <p>Hughes said “When the trade tensions were escalating with a 25 percent increase in tariffs of certain commodities, it was already impacting the financial viability of focusing on one single market as a major production centre. So if you take last eighteen months there is already been a great deal of investment coming to Vietnam, Malaysia and Turkey.”</p>
      <p>Airfreight rates For as long as Covid-19 impacts the supply chain, customers should anticipate that they will see rising prices on goods coming from China. Rates have increased for exports to China by 3x to 4x from January. Short term costs of supply chain optimization are going to increase, as the market has seen with the US-China trade war before shippers can absorb the burden of increased costs and passing them on to customers.</p>
      <p>“It’s proven quite challenging to ship goods by air into China since passenger flights have been cancelled, and now there are heavy backlogs in the U.S. and Europe for China-bound flights. We expect this to get better as most freighter flights are added, but rates could remain elevated for quite some time. Transit times will be longer and prices will likely be higher. Shippers are going to have to get creative during this period in terms of the routes their goods take to reach them, and their priority is going to have to be keeping the supply chain moving, rather than on the short term costs of supply chain optimisation,” said Shah.</p>
      <p>“We’re looking closely at the retail exports from China. The apparel industry — especially fast fashion — largely depends on air freight. If the fast fashion industry isn’t able to receive their goods within their typical lead times then they could be in trouble. This is yet another reminder to brands that they need to diversify their supply chains. If they haven’t already, this may prompt them to start investing in bulk space agreements (BSAs) originating from cities like Bangkok, Singapore and Taipei as opposed to concentrating in China,” he added.</p>
      <p>Air cargo is standing on the frontline “Even though it is a crisis, it is the time for the air cargo industry to demonstrate its value. Air cargo operators have continued to fly in fact some have even increase operations to make sure that vital medical aid, water, face masks and other equipment to help the people of China reduce the risk of further spreading of the virus. Once the control of the spreading of the disease has been managed, air cargo industry will be on the frontline to get that vital cargo out of China and to rest of the world where it is vitally needed,” said Hughes.</p>
      <p>Steve Townes, Chairman &amp; CEO, ACL Airshop and President, CEO &amp; Founder of Ranger Aerospace said “I personally believe the coronavirus will get worse before it gets better. Our company is hoping for the best but preparing for tough times just in case. For example, we have substantial operations in 16 airports in the entire Asia Pacific area. Some of our staffs are in places like Shanghai and Hong Kong and we are doing everything we can to keep our people safe by allowing them to work on different schedules, working from home and sending masks. But make no mistake, coronavirus at this point of time is a new wild card and it is not good for the air cargo industry.”</p>

      <p>Pallet users should pay a tax, according to one senior freight forwarder.</p>
      <p>In a wide-ranging speech at the Logistics CIO Europe conference in Amsterdam this morning, Steve Walker, head of consultancy SWG and founder of SBS Worldwide, bought out by DSV in 2013, urged the industry to consider a charitable tax.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to talk a little bit about carbon footprints, and the negative publicity we get for creating, supposedly, 3% of the world’s pollution by transport. Yet we never seem to fight back with any major initiatives – certainly not on a collective basis.</p>
      <p>“We should say we will no longer move pallets by ocean for free; we will implement a pallet levy of $5 per pallet come 2021. If all containers had 20 pallets, the pallet levy would yield $1.8m per large vessel.</p>
      <p>“Consider if you multiply that for the number of vessels arriving every week in Europe, will the customers want to pay it? No, but maybe the public will buy into it, and governments will give companies tax offsets.</p>
      <p>“We can undertake, as an industry, to contribute the majority of fees to marine charities to clean up the oceans, of which we, the human race, have made such a mess.”</p>
      <p>While pallets are generally considered re-usable and recyclable, he said, “let’s be honest – it’s not recycled as you and I would expect. They don’t have a very long shelf life, they slowly downgrade until they become something like wooden pellets for burning”.</p>
      <p>He added: “And there is a further consideration: wooden pallets should not have their own carbon footprint due to their weight.”</p>
      <p>The combined carbon impact of pallets on the emissions of a UCLV is illustrated in the diagram below.</p>
      <p>Mr Walker also urged the industry to come up with a better solution, which could be expedited by the proposed tax. He said he had given a talk to young freight forwarders in the UK who, he said, were “incredulous that four-way pallets had been around for 80 years and we hadn’t had the ability to think of a more modern way of moving goods in and out of containers.</p>
      <p>“When I first started in freight forwarding, vessels used to come into the port of London and the hatches would go back. The cargo would be removed from the hold and there were minimal supporting packaging materials.</p>
      <p>“The whole point of containers is to move freight. So I suggest we need to evaluate that one small thin column on a bill of lading, that has stayed the same for my near-50 year career, where it states packaging.”</p>
      <p>Mr Walker added that the industry should have a positive message about emissions: “When we are only delivering what the world has ordered in a take, make, consume and dispose society”.</p>

      <p>While Europe and North America begin to grapple with the alarming spread of coronavirus cases, shipping activity in China appears to be picking up, according to new data from liner consultancy SeaIntelligence.</p>
      <p>It says there is now a clear reduction in the number of announced blank sailings by carriers as trucking operations resume in China, leading to increased export cargo arriving at ports and ships are needed to handle the backlog of containers.</p>
      <p>“The weekly measurement of carriers’ blank sailings out of China show the coronavirus impact is now subsiding rapidly,” said SeaIntelligence chief executive Alan Murphy.</p>
      <p>“The bulk of the blank sailings were announced during weeks seven and eight; weeks nine and ten have seen a clear tapering off, and the level of new announcements of blank sailings is back to normal.</p>
      <p>“This means carriers are seeing demand ramping back up to normal levels over the next few weeks,” he added.</p>
      <p>However, while that might offer some relief to Chinese exporters and their international buyers, the knock-on effect from the unprecedented number of blanked sailings from Asia since Chinese New Year is seriously hitting Europe’s container ports, feeder services, barge operators and trucking.</p>
      <p>According to Sea-Intelligence data from last week, the number of Asia-Europe blanked sailings had reached 46, of which 29 were directly attributable to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
      <p>And there are reports that many of the vessels that did sail from China are arriving less than half-full at their first port of discharge in Europe. One UK terminal operations manager told The Loadstar he had “struggled to keep up” with the number of vessel deletions.</p>
      <p>“That also means that the feeders are dropping off as well, as there is no point in them calling if there is nothing to tranship,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt that our throughput numbers for the first quarter will be significantly down in the first quarter, but hopefully we will see the anticipated v-shaped recovery in Q2 and Q3 that will go some way to repairing the volume damage,” he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the feeder operators are having to survive on ad hoc “scraps” in the absence of the normal relay requirements. One north European feeder source told The Loadstar it had cancelled calls “left, right and centre”, as the containers “were just not there”.</p>
      <p>Like their ocean carrier customers, feeder operators are able to save port costs and fuel during weak demand periods, but still remain responsible for ship charter hire payments, unless they are able to redeliver the redundant vessels back to owners.</p>
      <p>The dramatic slump in imports due to lack of demand for the haulage sector has been “brutal”, according to a Felixstowe-based operator.</p>
      <p>“We have had to lay off some of our drivers, as business is just not there at the moment,” he told The Loadstar.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the impact of the cancelled ships from Asia is being felt right across the industry service sectors, from port agents to customs brokers and warehousing.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, European and North American exporters to Asia are likely to continue to see far higher-than-average freight rates as container supply chain bottlenecks continue to shift.</p>
      <p>“Back haul freight rates are beginning to increase as carriers increasingly favour empty repositioning for the limited back haul sailings,” said Mr Murphy. “This is in order to get into position to capture what is expected to be a peak in Chinese exports in the medium-term future. It could well be expected that back haul rates will be pushed even higher.”</p>
      <p>This appears to be particularly acute for Europe-Asia shippers, where 20ft containers remain heavily in demand – CMA CGM on Friday announced a peak season surcharge of $200 per teu and $400 per feu on shipments from morthern Europe to the Indian subcontinent from 15 March; and Maersk similarly announced a peak season surcharge of the same level on shipments from southern Europe to Asia from 16 March.</p>
      <p>There appears to be one sliver lining for both carriers and customers, however: sharply declining fuel prices look set to remove issues around the IMO low-sulphur rules, at least temporarily.</p>
      <p>“Two months ago, IMO 2020 was set to be the carriers’ major problematic issue. Today, low-sulphur fuel prices are dipping below the levels of normal fuel last year.</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, the sudden price war on oil has the potential to send fuel prices back to levels seen in 2015/16, and hence make the cost of low-sulphur fuel the least of the carriers’ problems,” Mr Murphy said.</p>

      <p>Forwarders are anticipating ad hoc air freight rates of $10 per kg, as shippers become desperate to release goods from China with little or no belly capacity.</p>
      <p>One Chinese forwarder said he expected a 777 or 747 aircraft to soon cost $1m, or $10 per kg, and spot rates have already increased twice in the past couple of days, by Rmb10 ($1.43) or more per kg to Europe.</p>
      <p>“We do expect a possible third increase towards the weekend,” he added.</p>
      <p>He said there were some charter possibilities, with carriers such as  SF Airlines, AirBridgeCargo and China Southern, but he said airlines would not hold the rate, and were quoting for each shipment on each flight, at a rate which could change before the cargo even got on the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Despite having a shipment confirmed last week, overnight the forwarder was told to pay an additional Rmb6 per kg if he wanted it uplifted on schedule.</p>
      <p>“We can only take cargo from those customers who understand the tricky situation that everything is beyond our control, basically.”</p>
      <p>He added that airlines were looking for full chargeable weight and that volumetric cargo was “not a priority” for airlines.</p>
      <p>One European forwarder added that rates today were already some $6 or $7 per kg: a “global phenomenon”.</p>
      <p>He added: “Demand is through the roof. And supply is not increasing as carriers, if anything, are reducing further the scheduled passenger flights from Chinese gateways, especially in the north, around Beijing.</p>
      <p>“The market is going very much one way – I reckon rates could hit $10 per kg by the end of the week.”</p>
      <p>The news will have investors – and the market – asking why Atlas Air has not returned its four parked freighters to operations.</p>
      <p>In its earnings call on 20 February, chief executive John Dietich said: “The demand has not been there for those aircraft, so we elected for the 747 converted freighters to be temporarily parked.”  In response to investor questions, he added that the lead time to get at least one aircraft back was as little as one week.</p>
      <p>“It could range anywhere from a week to 45 days, depending on the status of the aircraft, depending on the status of the engines, when it’s due for certain maintenance. There is no single answer to that, but there are a couple of aircraft that we would hold out that could move pretty quickly back online if we need them, and probably the other two, a little bit more lead time in that 30 to 45-day time period.”</p>
      <p>Atlas Air told The Loadstar it “had no comment at this time” on the freighters, but none of the four appears to have been brought back into operations, according to flight tracking websites. Pilots indicated on social media that Atlas did not have the crew to operate them, although this has not been confirmed.</p>
      <p>It could, of course, be that bringing back the freighters will take too long, or be prohibitively expensive – although it could be argued that there could not possibly be a better time to return them to service.</p>
      <p>The European forwarded noted that, while at the moment demand is “exceeding supply massively”, this could change.</p>
      <p>“The market may slow if the world goes into isolation and people stop shopping. If there aren’t shoppers, then there isn’t demand, and supply becomes balanced.”</p>
      <p>Intra-Asia sea freight, meanwhile, is “all OK”, with no issues on capacity or departures. The current demand for intra-Asian lanes is for manufacturing parts going to South-east Asia, but that is expected to cool through the month.</p>

      <p>A new report claims the Chinese government is using forced labour at factories, “tainting” global supply chains.</p>
      <p>The Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s (ASPI) Uyghurs for sale report alleges a “mass transfer” of ethic minority citizens from the north-west autonomous region of Xinjiang under conditions which “strongly suggest” forced labour.</p>
      <p>“Uyghurs are working in factories in the supply chains of at least 83 well known global brands in the technology, clothing and automotive sectors, including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei, Nike, Samsung, Sony and Volkswagen,” claims the report.</p>
      <p>China’s Uyghur ethnic minority has long been the subject of a government “re-education” programme, with up to a million people in internment camps in Xinjiang, with claims of human rights abuse, including using the camps as manufacturing facilities linked to global food, apparel, and hi-tech supply chains.</p>
      <p>And ASPI claims forced labour is not limited to Xinjiang and estimates “more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred from there to work in factories across China between 2017 and 2019” – some “sent directly from detention camps.”</p>
      <p>ASPI claims it has exposed a new phase in China’s ‘social re-engineering’ campaign targeting minority citizens: “a state-sponsored labour transfer scheme that is tainting the global supply chain”.</p>
      <p>The report highlights three examples of Uyghur workers who “appear to be” employed under forced labour conditions in factories which supply global brands, including a facility “equipped with watchtowers, barbed-wire fences and police guard boxes” in eastern China that manufactures shoes for Nike.</p>
      <p>The claims pose new reputation and legal risks for companies and consumers purchasing goods from China, as products “made in any part of the country, not just in Xinjiang”, may have passed through the hands of forced labourers, ASPI said.</p>
      <p>According to local media, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has refuted ASPI’s claims. The state-owned Global Times quotes local officials as saying the report was a “nefarious campaign that the west has launched to smear China, and another cock and bull story”.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, ZDNet reports claims by numerous technology firms named in the report that there was no evidence of forced labour in their supply chains, while Chinese telecoms giant Huawei attacked ASPI’s funding.</p>
      <p>It said: “The plain fact of the matter is that ASPI is currently registered on the Foreign Influence Transparency list, due to the fact it receives huge amounts of its funding from the United States government, and it also receives funding from a large number of US weapons manufacturers.”</p>

      <p>Shareholders suing FedEx have a “doomed” case, according to a recent court filing by FedEx management.</p>
      <p>A group of shareholders last year filed a case claiming FedEx executives had failed to disclose to investors the true problems at TNT following the NotPetya cyber attack, but had continued to trade shares themselves.</p>
      <p>However, in its response, FedEx claimed the shareholders had failed to demonstrate “a suspicious pattern of trades”, and said each director, in fact, had increased or maintained their shareholdings during the timeframe in the filing.</p>
      <p>It added: “Most critically, the complaint fails to make any particularised allegations about the knowledge or actions of any of the eleven outside directors. That omission dooms their case.”</p>
      <p>FedEx also argued that the allegations were “highly misleading” and omitted “numerous disclosures that informed investors about the effects of the cyber attack and FedEx’s recovery efforts”.</p>
      <p>As an example, FedEx noted that in its quarterly report dated 20 December 2017, it had disclosed that “not all customers are shipping at pre-attack volume levels”.</p>
      <p>The report also states: “TNT Express experienced a significant cyber attack in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the ongoing impact could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition in the future, particularly if our continuing recovery efforts do not proceed as expected.”</p>
      <p>Similarly, in its quarterly report dated 21 March 2018, FedEx says it disclosed “loss of revenue due to decreased shipments in the TNT network”, “incremental costs to restore information technology systems” and “lingering revenue impacts”.</p>
      <p>It also reveals that there is an “exculpatory provision in FedEx’s certificate of incorporation that immunises the directors from monetary liability for breaches of the duty of care”.</p>
      <p>The filing adds: “But FedEx never represented that it had not lost customers due to the cyber attack; to the contrary, the company disclosed that its efforts to restore the TNT customer base (and associated volumes) to pre-attack levels was ongoing.”</p>
      <p>The case continues.</p>

      <p>DP-DHL has confirmed its 2019 earnings, which hit €63.6bn ($72.4bn), with operating profit up 30% to €4.1bn.</p>
      <p>Global Forwarding, Freight, saw a 1% increase in revenue to €15.1bn, with operating profit up nearly 18% to €521m.</p>
      <p>“With an ebit plus of 18%, the division demonstrated a remarkable performance,” said CEO Frank Appel, “despite the fact that the global air freight market actually weakened substantially in the second half of the year due to a weaker global economy.</p>
      <p>“We were able to hold our market share in this difficult environment. At the same time, we were much more cost-efficient – thanks to the continued roll-out of our new IT systems, among other things.</p>
      <p>“We are thereby gradually laying the foundation for raising the profitability of the forwarding and freight business to a competitive level in the medium term, as planned.”</p>
      <p>This division, however, along with Express, is expected to be hardest hit by coronavirus, due to “the reductions in cross-border trade”.</p>
      <p>Mr Appel added, however: “If the situation returns to normal quickly, we could still make up the deficit over the course of the year … our employees are familiar in dealing with crises such as supply chain disruptions. Therefore, the situation could yield positive effects for us. What’s more, our fundamental growth drivers are sound – above all, the global boom in e-commerce.”</p>
      <p>The Express division boosted revenue by 5.9% to €17.1bn, driven by the international time-definite delivery business, which saw daily shipment volumes rise 5.7%. Operating profit grew 4.2% to €2bn, due to “strict yield management and continuous improvements in the network”. The operating margin was 11.9%.</p>
      <p>Supply Chain saw a marginal increase in revenue, up 0.6% to €13.4bn – “despite the sale of its Chinese business to SF Holding” in the first quarter of last year. It did however see new and existing business increase €1.2bn and operating profit rose from €520m to €912m – mainly as a result of one-time effects from the SF Holding deal, which contributed €426m to ebit. The division invested that mostly into restructuring its UK business. After adjusting for one-time effects, Supply Chain reported an operating margin of 4.7%.</p>
      <p>The group’s new eCommerce division increased revenue by 5.5% to €4bn, but restructuring measures, costing €80m, had a “negative impact on operating profit”, at €51m. eCommerce Solutions is expected to contribute between €50m and €100m to ebit this year.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to our broad geographic set-up and our comprehensive portfolio, we are in a very robust position and more resilient than other companies in our sector,” said Mr Appel.</p>
      <p>“Of course, we cannot disconnect completely from the global economy. We will not remain entirely unaffected by this worldwide crisis. However, it is currently much too early to judge its financial impact.</p>
      <p>“In spite of this, we are forging ahead with our Strategy 2025 and putting the company on track to continue our profitable growth in 2020 and beyond.”</p>

    <content>
      <p>The Digital Container Shipping Association (UDCSA) today published its guidelines for the box shipping sector to comply with the forthcoming International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) anti-cyber crime legislation.</p>
      <p>The IMO’s Resolution MSC.428(98) on Maritime Cyber Risk Management in Safety Management Systems is set to become law in January next year, and the new DCSA publication “provides all shipping companies with a common language and a manageable, task-based approach for meeting the IMO’s implementation timeframe”.</p>
      <p>Shipowner association BIMCO and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed cyber risk management frameworks that enable shipowners to “effectively incorporate cyber risk management into their existing safety management systems”, and the DCSA advice today helps the container shipping sector align with those frameworks.</p>
      <p>“We have worked with BIMCO on this, and this is something that not only our nine members will benefit, but the entire industry,” DCSA chief executive Thomas Bagge told The Loadstar last week.</p>
      <p>“As shipping catches up with other industries, such as banking and telcoms, in terms of digitisation, the need for cyber risk management becomes an imperative.</p>
      <p>“Due to the global economic dependence on shipping and the complex interconnectedness of shipping logistics, cyber attacks, such as malware, denial of service and system hacks, cannot only disrupt one carrier’s revenue stream, they can have a significant impact on the global economy,” he added today.</p>
      <p>The DCSA implementation guide breaks down the BIMCO framework into themes and maps these themes to the controls that underpin the NIST functional elements: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.</p>
      <p>The organisation said that by following its guidance, vessel owners would have “a catalogue of cyber security safeguards aligned with each vulnerability identified during risk assessment, together with notes explaining any residual risk”.</p>
      <p>Jakob Larsen, head of maritime safety &amp; security at BIMCO, explained: “The DCSA implementation guidance provides a thorough and refreshing deep dive into the challenge of how to implement cyber risk management in a shipowner company.</p>
      <p>“Initially thought of as a tool for container carriers, the guidance can also inspire the thinking in other shipping sectors as well as the ongoing update of the major shipping associations’ benchmark document Guidelines on Cyber Risk Management Onboard Ships.”</p>

      <p>More passenger flight suspensions have created a capacity crunch for intra-Asia air cargo, and as freight rates skyrocket airlines consider using passenger aircraft for cargo-only services.</p>
      <p>Due to the coronavirus and new travel restrictions, Cathay Pacific announced today the temporary withdrawal of passenger flights between Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan – the latest in a long list of suspensions that led the carrier to ground half its fleet.</p>
      <p>Flights between Hong Kong and Fukuoka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Tokyo, and Osaka are affected; as well as those between Taipei and Tokyo and Osaka.</p>
      <p>“Although we expect our passenger belly cargo operations to be impacted, we are evaluating how to continue serving our cargo customers to and from Japan,” Cathay said.</p>
      <p>“This includes the retention of certain passenger services for cargo carriage only.”</p>
      <p>Rickard Ingvarsson, Asia chief executive and global head of airfreight at Scan Global Logistics (SGL), said freight rates within Asia were “extremely volatile” because of the airline capacity adjustments.</p>
      <p>He told The Loadstar: “Intra-Asia has been heavily impacted with travel bans and restrictions, leading to capacity cuts of between 50% and 70%. As a result, rates are going up a few hundred percent overnight.</p>
      <p>“Hi-tech, pharma, retail, automotive and e-commerce are the most affected, and another critical challenge is the lack of raw materials for factories in South-east Asia.”</p>
      <p>Capacity out of China is still very scarce, Mr Ingvarsson added, with up to 70% fewer flights operating since the virus outbreak on the biggest tradelanes of intra-Asia, Europe and US.</p>
      <p>“About 5,000 tons, or equivalent to 50 747Fs of daily capacity has been pulled, creating a shortage of supply and a spike in airfreight rates on most destinations.</p>
      <p>“Some of the larger commercial carriers have pushed back the resume date to end of April, due to the further spread of Covid-19 virus.”</p>
      <p>While freighters have been operating throughout the crisis, mostly carrying medical aid and supplies into China, they only recently started exporting goods on return flights to US and Europe, according to Mr Ingvarsson.</p>
      <p>“Although factory workers and factories have resumed worked, they are still running at low pace, hence peak times are expected to happen in coming weeks, should there be no shortage of raw materials – which is another big concern,” he explained.</p>
      <p>SGL expects the volatile market of high freight rates and lengthy waiting times for cargo out of China to continue until next month. Therefore, the forwarder is recommending alternative transport routes.</p>
      <p>“We suggest customers consider ocean freight, rail freight, sea-air freight and even road freight, such as China-ASEAN cross-border trucks to diversify the risk.</p>
      <p>“It is anticipated that surging demand of rail freight will also drive rate increases. In the meantime, more and more charter flight services will be launched in the market to soften demand,” said Mr Ingvarsson.</p>

    <title>CMA CGM liftings up in 2019, but new rules and Ceva loss wipe out profits</title>

    <content>
      <p>CMA CGM has posted a net loss of $229m for 2019 – this compares with a profit of $34m the year before.</p>
      <p>The French transport group’s result was dragged down by the $329m negative impact of new accounting rules on vessel time charters and a $140m loss by Ceva Logistics.</p>
      <p>However, CMA CGM remains bullish about its liner trade outlook and its ability to turn around the loss-making logistics arm, despite the adverse effect of the coronavirus outbreak on Chinese exports.</p>
      <p>Turnover at the group soared 29% on the previous year, to $30.3bn, boosted by $7.1bn in revenue from Ceva.</p>
      <p>Container liftings on its fleet of 502 vessels increased by an above-industry par of 4.1%, to 21.6m teu, which CMA CGM attributed to growth in its shortsea business, “strong growth” in intra-Asia and “organic growth” in the African and Latin American trades.</p>
      <p>“After an extremely robust January, the early part of the year has been marked by the Covid-19 crisis,” it said, and added: “There has been an upturn in volumes, and a major catch-up effect is expected once the health situation stabilises, as western countries will be seeking to rebuild their inventories”.</p>
      <p>CMA CGM said it expected to return to “normal capacity as of mid-March” out of China, as it reactivates its network following the crisis.</p>
      <p>Chairman and chief executive Rodolphe Saade tweeted: “I observe an upturn of the economic activity in China; 80% of the manufacturing units are again operational. And every day, more open. We are anticipating a rebound in volumes related to restocking.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Ocean Alliance has reinstated some blanked sailings this month, after an earlier-than-expected recovery in manufacturing and trucking. A carrier source told The Loadstar last week it had been “pleasantly surprised” by the firm booking forecasts for the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>“Cargo is coming back onstream much earlier than we had expected in China, so we will be rehashing the number of loaders for the second half of March,” he said.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, CMA CGM and its peers have lost millions in top line revenue due to the Covid-19 restrictions which followed Chinese New Year and, even assuming pent up demand provides a liftings boost in the second quarter, they could find it a challenge to recover from Q1’s financial hit.</p>
      <p>Moreover, with the cashflow tap having been turned right down for several weeks, carriers without the benefit of deep pockets could become financially stressed in the coming months as they continue to be responsible for charter hire on their ships, along with their other usual fixed costs.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, CMA CGM is persevering with its goal of turning the Ceva acquisition from a negative asset to a positive for the group.</p>
      <p>In its “second-phase turnaround plan” for the logistics business, it said it was “pursuing its strategic transformation plan, aimed at delivering strong revenue growth combined with a significant improvement in its profitability”.</p>

    <content>
      <p>As XPO Logistics continues to ponder options to sell parts of its own business, it has returned to the acquisition trail with an agreement to buy part of Kuehne + Nagel’s contract logistics trade in the UK.</p>
      <p>This morning K+N announced it had entered into a “definitive agreement” to sell the drinks logistics, food services and retail &amp; technology vertical in its UK contract logistics division, part of wide-ranging review of the Switzerland-headquartered freight forwarder’s operations.</p>
      <p>Although both parties declined to disclose the purchase prices, K+N did say the operations concerned “generated a turnover of approximately Sfr750m ($808m) in 2019 and are supported by 7,500 employees”.</p>
      <p>Detlef Trefzger, K+N chief executive, explained: “One year ago, we first announced the strategic review of our contract logistics business to improve profitability and focus on our core, scalable solutions. We have now reached a major milestone in this effort, having secured an agreement to sell significant non-core assets in the UK.</p>
      <p>“With XPO Logistics, we are pleased to have found a good new home for our customers and employees.”</p>
      <p>However, KN claimed it “remains highly committed to excellent customer solutions and service in the UK across all business units, including contract logistics.</p>
      <p>“In particular, the company retains the industry verticals aerospace, government and pharma. These are among the group’s scalable leverage areas.” it said.</p>
      <p>The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including merger clearance by the competent competition authorities and is expected to close in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>In a separate development, XPO Logistics’ UK arm announced last week it had signed a new “long-term partnership agreement with Mercedes-Benz Parts Logistics to manage UK parts distribution”.</p>
      <p>The contract will see XPO distributing automotive parts to Mercedes-Benz’s UK retail and commercial vehicle dealerships, operating more than 40 daily routes from the manufacturer’s European Logistics Centre in Milton Keynes to XPO’s overnight-delivery depots across the UK. Part of the deal will see XPO acquire 42 new Mercedes-Benz Actros trucks dedicated to serving the contract.</p>
      <p>Juan Manuel Santiago Mendez, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Parts Logistics in the UK, said: “Our UK operation keeps consumers and businesses moving – it is responsible for more than 750,000 part numbers.</p>
      <p>“We believe XPO has the scale, capabilities and expertise required to support our retailers and dealers with reliable distribution. They have designed a comprehensive solution to our high standards, and their technology should enhance network visibility.”</p>

      <p>The most-up-to-date and reliable capacity utilisation data for air cargo is to be shared with Tiaca members as part of the association’s strategy to add value to their businesses.</p>
      <p>Clive Data Services has signed an agreement with Tiaca to provide market data for the association’s Cargo Pulse newsletter, as well as regular market trends content for social media, and speakers at the association’s conferences.</p>
      <p>Clive’s data centres on its weekly ‘dynamic load factor’ analysis, which offers a more realistic analysis of the utilisation of aircraft than has traditionally been available.</p>
      <p>Tiaca has recently approached its members, via a survey, to find out how it could add value to the membership. Members called for more education on air cargo economics and access to more market-driven data.</p>
      <p>“As part of the transformation of Tiaca, we are promising to deliver more content to our growing membership, but only content of value to their businesses and which accurately represents and promotes the global air cargo industry,” explained chairman Steven Polmans.</p>
      <p>“Clive’s dynamic load factor is registering a lot of interest, because it breaks with tradition and is changing the way air cargo usage is measured, based on the realities of today’s market. It is also the fastest source of data, which is also very appealing for our members.”</p>
      <p>Niall van de Wouw, managing director of Clive, said: “Working with Tiaca enables us to put our market intelligence in front of a large group of respected decision-makers, who we hope will embrace our new load factor methodology. This represents another important step forward in getting the industry to accept there is a new and more accurate way to measure how full flights are.”</p>
      <p>The Clive data, collated from a large and representative group of airlines around the world, bases its load factor on both volume and weight, as well as capacity available. By processing the data weekly, the industry can see trends in almost real time, rather than the broad sketch provided by monthly data, which fails to reveal trends in detail.</p>
      <p>Members will receive their first market analysis from Clive this month.</p>

    <title>Demand-sensing software: 'if UPS is using it, there must be something to it'</title>

      <p>UPS is in the process of fine-tuning its management of deliveries by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to inject more live data into its operations.</p>
      <p>At the end of January the integrator began the roll-out of its On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation platform, which gives drivers the most efficient routings, recalculating individual package delivery routes throughout the day, taking in changes in traffic conditions, pick-up commitments and delivery orders.</p>
      <p>In addition to more accurate delivery time estimates, it will enable new products and services that require higher levels of accuracy, reliability and responsiveness, according to UPS, and the enhanced routing tool will further reduce miles driven, fuel consumed and carbon emissions.</p>
      <p>The dynamic platform uses advanced algorithms, AI and machine learning.</p>
      <p>Some shippers have already begun to use AI and machine learning for forward-looking computations. Faced with uncertainty, shortening product cycles and rapidly changing consumption trends, they are trying to respond to new trends by using demand-sensing tools.</p>
      <p>According to ToolsGroup, a provider of supply chain planning tools software, demand-sensing “closes the gap between your plan and what’s actually happening in your supply chain”, by spotting changes and patterns in downstream activities.</p>
      <p>Going beyond historical data, using IT to detect trends can significantly improve forecasting accuracy, ToolsGroup claims. This can help manufacturers adjust production output and improve inventory management.</p>
      <p>One customer, Amplifon, a provider of hearing solutions, has seen an 18% reduction of inventory and cut obsolescence by 50%, according to the software firm.</p>
      <p>“Demand-sensing is proven to help our customers cut short-term forecast error by up to 50% and raise inventory performance by up to 20%, while hitting or exceeding target service levels,” ToolsGroup claimed.</p>
      <p>Hybrid demand-sensing systems use multiple forecasting techniques and data types, which range from promotional campaigns and competitors’ activities to updated sales figures, weather forecasts and social media sentiment.</p>
      <p>Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder and head analyst of Logistics Trends &amp; Insights, said bots which feed off social media could enter ample data into the system. UPS employs bots for its help desk and customer services, and all the data handled by these are fed into the system, she added.</p>
      <p>POS data are highly prized for demand-sensing, but it is possible to go ahead without it, according to E2 Open, a provider of intelligent applications, which argues that all that is needed to get started is the demand forecast and data on orders and shipments.</p>
      <p>“More than three-quarters of demand-sensing implementations use just these three internal signals, and on average they achieve a 40% reduction in forecast error,” claims E2 Open on its website.</p>
      <p>It stresses that demand-sensing does not bring about a fundamental change in operations, or replace longer-term forecasts, but improves visibility and provides a more granular view. Hence, it can also be applied to long-term forecasting.</p>
      <p>Air Canada Cargo applied AI to examine patterns of booking cancellations and changes in the final week prior to a flight’s departure, and found that cancellations and reductions in booked volume occur within that period at 60% of the rate of bookings. Adjusting for this can improve load factors by 6-8%.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, much of the communication about demand-sensing is emanating from software providers. Shippers and logistics firms have been less vocal about their trials. This suggests that, at this point, there is still more hype than action – much of it probably fuelled by the fact that a lot of venture capital is looking for investment opportunities in logistics technology.</p>
      <p>Ms Roberson says there is much venture capital circling over logistics, but the fact that UPS is moving forward with its use of AI indicates that the concept is gaining traction.</p>
      <p>“If UPS is using it, there must be something to it. It is a conservative company,” she said.</p>

      <p>Ocean carriers are preparing for a return to fully booked ships.</p>
      <p>The recovery in China’s manufacturing is reported to be up to around 80% of pre-new year levels, and regional transport movements are also getting back up to speed, it seems.</p>
      <p>“We have seen many terminals and depots returning to normal operations,” said OOCL. “The reefer plug shortage issue in Shanghai, Tianjin and Ningbo has also gradually improved and more trucking services have resumed.”</p>
      <p>The carrier’s view was supported by online freight marketplace Freightos, which reported this week that manufacturing in China had taken “definite steps” towards normality.</p>
      <p>And on the intermodal situation, Freightos said: “Inter-province trucking, which last week was a major pain point, is now operating at about 80% capacity as well.”</p>
      <p>The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) commentary this week reported vessel utilisation levels of 75%-80% for Europe and around 70% for US sailings.</p>
      <p>Carriers have been obliged to withdraw almost half of scheduled capacity on both the Asia-Europe and transpacific tradelanes since the Chinese new year on 25 January, which analyst Sea-Intelligence estimates at some 1.9m teu.</p>
      <p>This radical action could have cost the container lines around $2bn in lost revenue, according to the analyst, although carriers appeared to have succeeded in protecting spot rates from any serious erosion during the worst of the virus crisis.</p>
      <p>In fact, the North Europe component of today’s SCFI recorded a 3.2% uplift, to $830 per teu, while for Mediterranean ports, there was a slight decline of 1.4%, to $915 per teu.</p>
      <p>Carriers are in the process of preparing to raise FAK rates later in the month, as they look to recover severe losses incurred in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>The knock-on effect of the blanked sailings from China has caused a major problem for Europe’s exporters. Firstly, shippers with cargo already delivered to container terminals are having to wait weeks before loading, and secondly, acute equipment shortages at depots, caused by the absence of import cargo box returns, has resulted in some carriers refusing bookings altogether.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, The Loadstar has seen wave after wave of North Europe-Asia ‘peak season surcharge’ (PSS)  announcements from carriers in the past two weeks, which has driven a spot rate spike of 24% in the past week, to $786 per 40ft, according to Drewry’s WCI index.</p>
      <p>“Not only can we not make any bookings due to our carriers rationing equipment, but when we eventually do, who knows what the PSS will be,” said one UK forwarder.</p>
      <p>And Flexport’s head of ocean freight for Europe, Martin Holst-Mikkelsen, told The Loadstar storms hitting North Europe last month had also contributed to export delays.</p>
      <p>“The stormy weather led to a growing backlog of containers waiting to be exported at sea terminals, prompting the introduction of restricted delivery slots,” said Mr Holst-Mikkelsen.</p>
      <p>On the transpacific, spot rates as recorded by the SCFI were virtually unchanged this week for US east coast ports, at $2,679 per 40ft, while for the west coast, rates edged down 2.4% to $1,361 per 40ft.</p>
      <p>“Rate increases announced for 1 April show carriers expect a slow March, followed by a strong April and beyond,” said Freightos.</p>

      <p>Omnichannel is a word more often associated with high street retailing than air cargo, but it’s becoming a reality for airlines as options for distribution take off.</p>
      <p>Booking platforms, carrier websites and, of course, the traditional phone call all feature in the buying, selling and distribution of capacity – but the lines are blurring.</p>
      <p>ECS Group, a large GSSA, is launching a booking platform for its Total Cargo Management customers – airlines which outsource cargo in its entirety.</p>
      <p>“We are going further,” said chief executive Adrien Thominet. “We were just doing operations, but we can do so much more, and are intending to develop a web platform with business intelligence.”</p>
      <p>He said GSSAs could be at risk from booking platforms like WebCargo and cargo.one, but added: “You can’t book any kind of shipment through them.</p>
      <p>“We have a real advantage – direct access to our carriers’ booking systems via API. We are ‘Uber-ising’ capacity.</p>
      <p>“Booking platforms aren’t a threat, but distribution channels will change. We don’t want to be just a witness, we want our own integrated platform, with direct access to reservations.”</p>
      <p>ECS is working with a start-up technology company in Singapore to develop the platform, which is expected to be ready in the fourth quarter. It will offer an “automated, dynamic system”, using artificial intelligence to help it learn, and will offer a 30-minute guaranteed booking time.</p>
      <p>“We need to be able to drive our own destiny,” said chief commercial officer Robert van de Weg, “and the real advantage here is that it saves time.”</p>
      <p>However, booking platforms don’t seem worried – and in fact welcome the further digitisation of the industry.</p>
      <p>“GSAs are great,” said WebCargo’s global vice president for business development, Camilo Garcia Cervera. “They are good tools for airlines. I am a firm believer that those which add value have a bright future.”</p>
      <p>But he added it was not comparable to a booking platform.</p>
      <p>“We work with APIs too, but GSAs mainly represent carriers in certain markets. ECS has total control of some airlines, so that specific group may be different. But our goal is to give airlines a global reach. We don’t see GSAs as competition. We don’t buy and sell capacity, we distribute it.</p>
      <p>“The whole trade will become multi-channel from a distribution perspective. Our job is to work with every single player in the industry. We are not a digital GSA. Booking is just one component of the sales process.”</p>
      <p>Cargo.one, which yesterday added a new airline, TAP Air Cargo, to its portfolio, has been a noisy entrant to the booking platform market. Mr Garcia Cervera said he welcomed that competition too. But he said the industry needed more than just e-bookings.</p>
      <p>“We need to look at the entire market, a solution for the entire chain. The industry says it is going to digitise, but that is not just bookings, that’s just one part.</p>
      <p>Freightos, which developed WebCargo, also offers airlines the ability to digitise.</p>
      <p>“We are developing additional products – not every airline is API-capable and we have products for those – the vast majority are not ready.</p>
      <p>“E-booking is not the cheapest of tasks, some airlines don’t have the resolve, the manpower, or the skillset or finances. We can build the API for airlines, it’s a key differentiator. E-booking is one key component of the entire chain; it’s just one of our products.”</p>
      <p>And he added that the industry could benefit from looking beyond its own niche.</p>
      <p>Camilo Garcia Cervera</p>
      <p>“We look outside our industry for innovation, we are constantly looking at what is happening in the global economy and other industries, and how we can adapt that to ours.</p>
      <p>“Air freight is not a one-of-a-kind industry. Sure, it has its own challenges, but it’s not immune to the rest of the world, so why not adapt it to customer purchase behaviour?”</p>
      <p>He added that carriers’ websites were also an important part of the multi-channel mix.</p>
      <p>“We all recognise the value of airline websites, they’re a great exposure tool, but they also understand the benefits of platforms.”</p>

      <p>Airlines and forwarders are beginning to release their plans for transatlantic air freight over the coming weeks – and rates are starting to surge.</p>
      <p>Some carriers have promised existing bookings will be honoured for between two days and a week, after which there will be rolling bookings, while forwarders are talking of being quoted from €6.50 per kilo to £10 per kg out of the UK into the US, which is “unheard of”.</p>
      <p>Companies are trying to ensure air freight routes out of mainland Europe to the US are maintained. Geodis announced this morning it is launching a four-times-a-week round-trip service next week. It will operate from Liege to Chicago, with connecting services to US and European gateways.</p>
      <p>Dachser said it was extending its chartered air freight service between Frankfurt and China. From Monday, it will offer round trips to the US, Latin America and Frankfurt, to Shanghai.</p>
      <p>“This programme puts us in a position to offer a robust and reliable premium air service to Asia for our customers in the Americas as well,” said Timo Stroh, head of global air freight.</p>
      <p>“We are ready for whatever happens on the air freight market in the coming weeks, and fully appreciate being in a position to tackle the challenges of the future today.”</p>
      <p>But despite various new arrangements, Flexport warned shippers that they could face shortages as available capacity plummets.</p>
      <p>“There will inevitably be some supply chain bottlenecks and inventory shortages as a result of longer transit times and fewer connections and opportunities on a per airport-pair-basis,” said Jan van Casteren, vice president Europe.</p>
      <p>“For businesses trading in the US, it’s imperative that they prepare for space limitations over the coming weeks, and fluctuations in freight costs as a result.”</p>
      <p>He advised: “There are a number of steps organisations can take to minimise potential delays and unexpected costs, and supply chain visibility will be crucial when planning and forecasting for any disruption.”</p>
      <p>Flexport said it would use its real-time visibility to help shippers choose the best routings.</p>
      <p>“This might be looking at moving cargo onto flights from the UK, while they still remain in operation, onto charter flights or ocean liners, or onto flights to neighbouring countries like Mexico or Canada, and then using cross-border trucking services.”</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Group said its passenger airlines would continue to fly to Chicago, Newark and Washington and that it was drawing up a special flight schedule. However, all the group’s other flights to the US are suspended until further notice. Canada flights will continue. Its freighter services will also operate as per the schedule, apart from to China. You can find the details here.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson added: “If a shipment is affected by flight cancellations or changes, it will be rebooked automatically.”</p>
      <p>Delata, which, with partners AF-KLM and Virgin, make up nearly one-quarter of transatlantic market share, said its last westbound flights to six destinations was today. It has also placed an embargo on pet transport and human remains.</p>
      <p>American Airlines has its flight details here.</p>
      <p>IAG Cargo, as yet unaffected by President Trump’s travel ban, said it was  “still open for business on transatlantic routes”, but advised customers to “stay in close conversation with your local sales representative”.</p>
      <p>As one forwarder noted, pointing to the carrier announcements: “Their rates have jumped though, unsurprisingly. They didn’t mention that part.</p>
      <p>“What a world we live in. You couldn’t have made this up two months back.”</p>
      <p>And to illustrate that point, two charts released today by the TAC Index summarise the craziness rather well.</p>

    <title>Fiata failed us and is not 'fit for purpose' in a digital age, claims veteran forwarder</title>

      <p>Fiata and other forwarding associations have failed the industry and should be restructured, claims veteran freight forwarder Steve Walker.</p>
      <p>In a speech in Amsterdam this week, Mr Walker argued that ‘data conferences’ such as TradeLens, which appear to have replaced the liner conferences of old, have been overlooked by the forwarding industry – which should have been protecting its data.</p>
      <p>“Our historical suppliers, the container lines, are leaping forward decades, having been unwilling or unable to give forwarders supporting data for decades.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful that they are digitising and bringing together all their suppliers – certainly for their own benefit – on blockchain, but equally, hopefully, for freight forwarders.</p>
      <p>“I just wish that the data offerings had included forwarders at inception.</p>
      <p>“It has to be recognised that we have more microdata and will be reluctant to give this up to create future data revenue streams for the carriers.”</p>
      <p>Pointing to the IBM/ Maersk TradeLens blockchain group, which was approved by the FMC on 6 February, he said Fiata should have been involved from the start.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t realise the FMC was dealing with data/software and data storage organisations …[but] it is to the shame of freight forwarding that Fiata completely missed it.</p>
      <p>“It [has] became abundantly clear that the lead [forwarding] association, Fiata, is not fit for purpose.</p>
      <p>“Acting director general Steve Morris came out in support of the need for change, and accepted Fiata was not leading the forwarder into the digitised debate.</p>
      <p>“Three years ago there was a presentation at Fiata suggesting that it create its own blockchain initiative. It was well received. Nothing was done with it. If that had been a commercial business, the person at the top who had responsibility for that non-action would have been fired.</p>
      <p>“In an association where there is no accountability, there is no consequence.</p>
      <p>“I would suggest the majority of the people at the top, who seem to me to be the blocking cork in a good bottle of red wine, need to be removed so that expertise and frontline experience can replace them to help Fiata re-establish its credibility.</p>
      <p>“Fiata needs to become the forum for freight forwarders …to feel free to discuss defining matters. It needs to become a data association, it needs to be more commercial, and have a media presence.</p>
      <p>“Forwarders should join Fiata directly, in addition to their country association. And as the industry wants stronger leadership, it will have to make a greater financial membership contribution.</p>
      <p>He pointed to the ‘new start’ at Fiata, with recently appointed director general Stephane Graber.</p>
      <p>“I asked Fiata to move closer to its customer base, perhaps a Northern European port. Well, the good news is it is moving closer to water – from Zurich to Lake Geneva.”</p>
      <p>Mr Walker also lambasted Clecat, which has spent four years working on the European CORE digitisation project – which put the blame on forwarders for poor data communication.</p>
      <p>“But what steps did Clecat take to mitigate the damage to its customers, and those of Fiata, if this was the decision the project was coming to? If the associations cannot come together to head off bad publicity, or seek improvement, then what is their value?”</p>
      <p>“There appears to be too much pontificating, not enough front-line action and no cohesive cross-association working.</p>
      <p>“If we as sector are coming together, so too should the associations, maybe to create a super data association.”</p>
      <p>Mr Walker did, however, note one silver lining.</p>
      <p>“There is an acceptance of competing companies meeting, providing there is no complicity or collusion on rates and services, and that those companies can have discussions on collective software offerings.</p>
      <p>“Which is something to build on.”</p>

      <p>The trend towards defined services that shippers can book online is spreading – and it is not limited to the multinational logistics players.</p>
      <p>Smaller forwarders are gearing up to join the battle for business their sales staff could not previously get near.</p>
      <p>The latest from the large operator pool to unveil a line of digital offerings is Damco, the forwarding arm of the AP Møller Group.</p>
      <p>Last week, it launched three services clients can book online, and besides booking, all three feature full track and trace functionality.</p>
      <p>The services are a standard product for air or ocean cargo: a Plus service for regular customers, that features a dedicated customer portal with various access levels and role-specific to-do lists; and a Customised product with tailored features like customised reports and an order management system that gives visibility from purchase order to proof of delivery on a dashboard, as well as third-party updates.</p>
      <p>“We have simplified and refined our offering after listening to our customers’ feedback,” said Damco chief executive Saskia Groen-in’t-Woud.</p>
      <p>Damco has eschewed a price-quoting tool for the new line-up, but on the other hand, the new services go beyond general cargo to cover all commodities currently handled by the company under HBLs, according to COO Martin Ring.</p>
      <p>“We anticipate that 80% of our customers will be using Standard service,” he said.</p>
      <p>But smaller forwarders are gearing up for the battle for online clients.</p>
      <p>“We are evaluating service providers in view of integrating such services for clients into our system,” said Karl-Heinz Legler, general manager of Rutherford Global Logistics.</p>
      <p>And Quick Cargo Service is preparing to set up a platform to present its products online. The idea is to put all rates from its carriers into the system and set up tariffs for every postal code in the company’s home market in Germany, integrating elements like customs clearance, documents processing and so on.</p>
      <p>This should allow the customer to select a transit time, obtain a quote for a standard service and book a shipment with one click, said chief executive Stephan Haltmayer. The project is in the planning stage and should go live soon, he added.</p>
      <p>More and more forwarders are offering online products, joining the race between traditional forwarders and the likes of Flexport, added Mr Haltmayer.</p>
      <p>“I think we have all realised that we have to put our products online,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added that doing so would funnel forwarders’ offerings onto rate platforms, where they will sit side by side with the services of the large multinational players, which have more leverage to achieve lower rates.</p>
      <p>Most SME forwarders have tried to avoid this, emphasising the service element rather than price, but Mr Haltmayer sees a need to offer customers both a standardised online option and the traditional service element.</p>
      <p>While online bookings account for a small portion of the overall business, perhaps 5%-10%, it is traffic forwarders traditionally would get, and now stand to lose. To keep it, they have to join the online race, even though the lion’s share of their activities remains on the direct client service side, he reckons.</p>

      <p>The off-docks at Chittagong have stopped handling the containers of Maersk Line, OOCL and Gold Star Line, as part of a dispute over fees.</p>
      <p>Since Wednesday morning, the depots have provided no service to these shipping lines, which have a 20%-25% market share in transporting export cargo.</p>
      <p>In January, the depots raised fees by nearly 22%, a rise the shipping lines did not accept and they have paid no bills since then, according to the Bangladesh Inland Container Depots Association (BICDA).</p>
      <p>“They owe over $2.5m to the 18 off-docks,” BICDA secretary Ruhul Amin Sikder, told The Loadstar. “Moreover, they are not accepting our bills. How we can provide services to them?”</p>
      <p>He added: “We will resume services for them only after they make the payment.”</p>
      <p>Mr Sikder said South Korean Hanjin Shipping, declared bankrupt in 2017, still owes $3.5m, while another line owes $2.95m.</p>
      <p>“What will happen if these lines also stop business here, due to coronavirus? How we will be able to recover the money?” he asked.</p>
      <p>He said the depots set fees in line with a report by the Chittagong Port Authority. The majority of outbound containers are handled by the Chittagong-based off-docks. Cargo reaches the depots from factories mainly by truck and covered van and are stuffed in containers.</p>
      <p>They are then sent to port jetties to board feeder vessels bound for hub ports in Singapore, Colombo and Port Klang to be reloaded on mother vessels for final destinations.</p>
      <p>“The deadlock will disrupt our exports severely,” said Selim Hossain, a Dhaka-based garment exporter, who believes the depots should not have raised the fees without consensus with shippers.</p>
      <p>“When the country’s exports are facing disruption due to the coronavirus epidemic, and continue declining, we can’t pay increased fees.</p>
      <p>“The depots should resume the services immediately and government needs to intervene before the trade faces a further blow,” Mr Hossain added.</p>

      <p>Transatlantic air freight rates are expected to soar, possibly overnight, following the US travel ban on mainland Europe, excluding – for now – the UK and Ireland.</p>
      <p>Up to 80% of air freight capacity on the transatlantic could be cut as airlines ground passenger flights, with bellies normally taking the lion’s share of the capacity on the route.</p>
      <p>“IAG, Air Canada, Virgin and Aer Lingus are all going to be very busy,” said one senior air freight analyst.</p>
      <p>“There is a tremendous amount of trade between the two continents, and the vast majority is in bellies. If that capacity plunges, you can only imagine the reduction in trade on the Atlantic. There is going to be tremendous pressure on capacity.”</p>
      <p>One European forwarder told The Loadstar: “This is going to be another case of ‘pay to play’. Where prices are going to go is anyone’s guess.”</p>
      <p>But he suggested that rates, which are normally about 65p per kg from the UK to the east coast US, could likely go to £2 per kg shortly. Charters could rise to $7.50 per kg, according to one calculation cited.</p>
      <p>Current dynamic load factors on the transatlantic are 78% westbound, and 60% eastbound, according to Clive Data Services. Even with a modest assumption of 60% of the capacity removed, demand is easily going to outstrip supply.</p>
      <p>“There are so few airlines with freighters left,” said the analyst. “The US majors have none, it’s really only Lufthansa and AF-KLM, and they have cut their freighter fleets. This is a big gift for IAG.”</p>
      <p>Forwarders said that any BSAs on non-cut capacity would be unlikely to be honoured by the airlines, and in any event, most contracts would only last until the end of the month.</p>
      <p>“The US market tends to work on spot rates anyway, as there is so much transatlantic capacity, and it’s cheap. The market rarely becomes overwhelmed. But if I was BA now, I wouldn’t take any forward bookings, and I’d implement penalties for no-shows.”</p>
      <p>Airlines throughout Europe are said to be in meetings to determine how to manage their capacity, with more information expected this afternoon. Some are already talking about using passenger aircraft just to move freight on the transatlantic – and are looking to command a high price for it.</p>
      <p>Trucking is also expected to be key, with mainland European carriers looking to fly goods into Canada and Mexico on passenger aircraft, and trucked over the borders into the US. In Europe, forwarders are looking to truck freight into the UK for Virgin and IAG flights into the US.</p>
      <p>“Cargo is going to be redirected and trucked,” said one forwarder. “The multinational forwarders will already be diverting it to the UK.”</p>
      <p>However, belly capacity from the UK has already been cut. BA announced on 2 March it was cutting back transatlantic flights as passenger demand fell. Norwegian cancelled 22 long-haul flights between Europe and the US from 28 March to 5 May.</p>
      <p>One forwarder also questioned whether the US would extend its ban.</p>
      <p>“Will Trump work out that the UK is in Europe? And if you look at Heathrow Terminal 5 (BA’s hub), it is full of passengers in transit, it’s a mighty pot of thousands of Europeans. What’s going to stop them going to the US? And how long will the UK and Ireland stay open? It could be that freighters become the only capacity.”</p>
      <p>The analyst added: “This really shows how flexible we are as human beings. If you’d said a few weeks ago that the transatlantic would effectively be closed, no one would have believed you. But the industry will adapt, as it always does.”</p>

      <p>All bets are off on transport costs as China’s output moves back towards pre-virus outbreak levels.</p>
      <p>Amid mounting signs of supply chain disruption and a swathe of cost increases, deadlines for annual contract talks are receding into the future, leaving companies to chart uncertain waters with contingency plans stretched to the limits and beyond.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of anxiety,” reported John Haber, chief executive of logistics expenditure consultancy Spend Management.</p>
      <p>“It’s certainly a tremendous challenge. It’s very hard to predict what’s going to happen.”</p>
      <p>Various sources report that Chinese output has rebounded and is now approaching pre-virus levels.</p>
      <p>“There were many indications this week of Chinese manufacturing returning to life. Even the city of Wuhan is taking initial steps back to normal,” Freightos noted today.</p>
      <p>“One interesting sign that production is picking up is the spike in intra-Asia air cargo rates – indicating that Chinese factories are restocking the components they need to manufacture the backlog of orders caused by the shutdown,” it added.</p>
      <p>US importers are bracing for a surge in imports, with the combination of pent-up demand from the extended Chinese New Year hiatus and reduced vessel capacity from blanked sailings pointing to strong demand for eastbound capacity.</p>
      <p>“Because of the backlog, we’re going to see a lot of freight coming in,” Mr Haber said.</p>
      <p>Already the disruption to US import supply chains is significant. According to a survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), almost 75% of US companies have experienced supply chain disruption, due to repercussions of the pandemic. Average lead times have more than doubled from the end of 2019, the ISM report indicates.</p>
      <p>“Companies are faced with a lengthy recovery to normal operations in the wake of the virus outbreak,” said ISM chief executive Thomas Derry.</p>
      <p>The prospect of lingering capacity limitations is exacerbating the situation.</p>
      <p>“Equipment and space availability is a concern across the globe,” noted Crane Worldwide Logistics yesterday.</p>
      <p>The outlook for air cargo is even more ominous, with passenger flight schedules slashed drastically. Even postal volumes are stuck – Korea Post announced that it suspended air mail to Chile because of lack of airfreight capacity.</p>
      <p>In the US, the trucking market is still slow, but Mr Haber expects this to change quickly as import volumes pick up and disruptions occur in the US.</p>
      <p>There is near universal agreement that a spike in imports will stretch capacity and lead to soaring rates, but when this will happen and how long it lasts is anybody’s guess.</p>
      <p>The National Retail Federation’s Global Port Tracker projects US imports in March will be down 18.3% from a year ago, and 3.5% behind the April 2019 volume one month later. For May and June, it predicts volumes to be up 9.3% and 9.6%, respectively, over the corresponding months last year.</p>
      <p>Shipping lines are expected to raise rates next week, or on April 1, following announcements of increases on Asia-Europe sectors. Airfreight rates are already on the rise. One carrier that operates freighters to China has binned existing rates for loose cargo and pre-built shipments with immediate effect, according to one forwarder.</p>
      <p>Rate hikes are flanked by various surcharges, from demurrage to fees for getting hold of empty containers in some markets. Somewhat perplexingly, FedEx and UPS have announced increases in their fuel surcharges, despite the current slump in oil prices, Mr Haber noted.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see their justification,” he said.</p>
      <p>With the prospect of looming rate hikes, airlines are in no hurry to conclude contract negotiations with their clients.</p>
      <p>“It looks like contract negotiations are going to be pushed back,” Mr Haber said. “It’s an unstable environment now.”</p>
      <p>This leaves shippers and importers largely exposed to the ad hoc market, with smaller players in danger of losing out.</p>
      <p>“You get people who try to hog the capacity,” Mr Haber said. “The likes of Home Depot and Lowes are bringing in a lot of goods.”</p>
      <p>He estimates that probably 70% of US companies have contingency plans, but these are not able to shield them from the impact of the disruptions from the pandemic.</p>
      <p>“With this type of issue you can have a lot of contingency plans, but it’s spreading everywhere. You can’t put a distribution centre on the moon,” he added.</p>

      <p>MSC is deploying the world’s biggest ships to evacuate empty containers from China to the US, as carriers on the transpacific try to overcome imbalances after weeks of coronavirus disruption to their box control systems.</p>
      <p>There have been reports of severe equipment shortages in the US and Europe as a consequence of carriers blanking around half of all headhaul sailings since Chinese New Year, due to the Covid-19 virus outbreak.</p>
      <p>Alphaliner said MSC was redeploying the 23,756 teu MSC Mia to the transpacific leg of the 2M’s North Europe-Asia-USWC, combined AE1/Shogun-TP-6/Pearl, loop, and it will be the largest container vessel ever to call at the US.</p>
      <p>It added that two weeks later the 23,656 teu MSC Nela would shift from the AE2/Swan Asia-North Europe loop to the transpacific, to perform a similar function.</p>
      <p>Alphaliner noted that, by replacing the normal 13,000 teu-plus ships that habitually operate its transpacific strings, MSC and 2M partner Maersk would be able to reposition more than 6,000 teu of empty containers to the US to ease pent-up booking demand.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the damage to the US San Pedro Bay ports’ throughput by China’s enforced manufacturing lockdown is evidenced by February figures, just released by the Los Angeles and Long Beach port authorities.</p>
      <p>At Los Angeles, the largest box port in North America, imports plummeted 22.5% last month, compared with February 2019, to 270,025 teu, while exports declined by 5.7%, to 134,468 teu. Empty container movements slumped by 35% to 139,544 teu.</p>
      <p>At neighbouring Long Beach, imports dropped by 17.9%, to 248,592 teu, although exports were actually ahead by 19.3%, to 125,559 teu, and empty containers were down 12.8% to 164,277 teu.</p>
      <p>However, executive director for the port of Long Beach Mario Cordero was optimistic about recovery.</p>
      <p>“Once the virus is contained, we may see a surge of cargo, and our terminals, labour and supply chain will be ready to handle it,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, notwithstanding hopes of a “v-shaped” bounce-back among ports and carriers, one leading liner analyst is warning that the industry is facing a contraction in global container volumes not seen since the financial crash of 2008.</p>
      <p>Via his Linked-In platform, SeaIntelligence Consulting’s Lars Jensen warned that with the pandemic rapidly escalating in Europe and the US, the shutdown of non-essential public workplaces, events and leisure activities would see import demand drop sharply.</p>
      <p>“Hence the expectation of a surge out of China to make up for the earlier shortfall will be postponed,” said Mr Jensen.</p>
      <p>He added that if the virus crisis played out in a similar fashion to the financial crash, when consumers and businesses suddenly reigned-in their spending, it could result in a 10% contraction in container volumes, equalling a shrinking of some 17m teu globally for container lines and a loss of around 80m teu for container ports and terminals.</p>

    <title>Pandemic looks set to hit Cathay Pacific hard, after a 'challenging' 2019</title>

      <p>Cathay Pacific is expecting a “substantial loss” in the first half of the year, due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>Reporting its 2019 financial results yesterday, the carrier said it had faced “an incredibly challenging environment” because of the intensification of the US-China trade war and social unrest in Hong Kong, which drove the city into recession.</p>
      <p>“As a result, our second-half results – traditionally stronger compared with first-half results – fell well below what we would have hoped for,” said Cathay Pacific chairman Patrick Healy.</p>
      <p>The group’s second-half attributable profit was HK$344m (US$44.3m), compared with HK$1.3bn in the first-half, with full-year earnings plunging 28% year on year.</p>
      <p>Mr Healy said Cathay’s cargo business performed “significantly below expectations” last year – revenue falling 14.2%, to HK$21.1bn (US$2.7bn).</p>
      <p>Total cargo carried was down 6%, to 2m tonnes, with cargo revenue tonne km down 6.7% and load factors down 4.4%. Cargo yield decreased 7.9% to HK$1.87.</p>
      <p>“Cargo demand was depressed all year as a result of US-China trade tensions and was noticeably below that of 2018,” Mr Healy explained.</p>
      <p>“However, it did pick up later in 2019, during the traditional high season, reflecting new consumer product, specialist airfreight shipments and restocking ahead of holiday period.”</p>
      <p>He said the carrier was already expecting the first half of 2020 to be “extremely challenging, financially”, but the coronavirus outbreak had exacerbated the situation.</p>
      <p>“Cathay Pacific has been through challenging times before, but the scale we are facing in the current situation really is unprecedented,” he told investors. “It is difficult to predict when these conditions will improve.</p>
      <p>“Travel demand has dropped substantially and we have taken a series of short-term measures in response. These have included a sharp reduction of capacity in our passenger network.</p>
      <p>“Despite these measures, we expect to incur a substantial loss for the first half of 2020.”</p>
      <p>While Mr Healy expects the cargo business to continue to face “headwinds”, he said the carrier was “cautiously optimistic” following the recent reduction in US-China trade tensions, and noted the airline had kept cargo capacity intact.</p>
      <p>With the coronavirus now officially a pandemic and passenger flight cancellations continuing worldwide, Cathay Pacific Cargo said on Monday it was considering using passenger jets for cargo-only flights.</p>
      <p>This follows the temporary suspension of flights between Hong Kong and Japan, with Cathay reportedly cutting passenger capacity by two-thirds across its network in March and April.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Scoot, the low-cost carrier owned by Singapore Airlines, is reportedly flying pure cargo flights to China until the end of March, with operations handled by Singapore Airlines Cargo.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Bangladesh’s top decision-making body, ECNEC, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, on Tuesday approved construction of country’s first deepsea port, in Matarbari, near Cox’s Bazar.</p>
      <p>The port, with 16-metres of water depth, will be able to accommodate 8,000 teu vessels, cutting Bangladesh’s dependence on feeder vessels that link with the transhipment hubs of Singapore, Colombo and Port Klang.</p>
      <p>Currently, its ports of Chittagong and Mongla have a maximum 9.5 metre draught and can accommodate 2,000 teu vessels.</p>
      <p>The new port will cost over $2bn, which will be funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the government of Bangladesh and the Chittagong port authority.</p>
      <p>JICA will provide some loans at 0.01% interest, and some will be charged at 0.9%. JICA’s feasibility study report found the port financially viable.</p>
      <p>Construction is expected to be completed by December 2026.</p>
      <p>In its first phase, the port will have a 460-metre container quay and a 300-metre multipurpose quay, the two facilities operated by two quay gantry cranes, one multipurpose gantry crane, six rubber-tyred gantry cranes, two reach stackers and 12 yard tractors.</p>
      <p>Government officials said the country’s cargo handling capacity would increase significantly when the port comes into operation and could become a container hub for neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>Planning minister MA Mannan explained that Bangladesh’s export-import activities were increasing year on year and established ports had little capacity to handle this growth.</p>
      <p>“As our economic activities have increased significantly, the construction of a deepsea port is now a demand of time,” he said. “It’s a big work. The port complex will change the scenario of the entire area.”</p>
      <p>Bangladesh annually exports goods worth nearly $40bn and imports nearly $60bn. The prime seaport, Chittagong, handles over 92% of seaborne cargo, and with a nominal capacity of 1.7m teu, handled 3.1m teu in 2019.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mongla port handled 57,732 teu and 500,000 tonnes of bulk cargo last year.</p>

      <p>UPS has announced that Carol Tomé (pictured above) will succeed David Abney as the company’s new chief executive.</p>
      <p>Mr Abney, currently both chief executive and chairman, will relinquish the former position on 1 June and retire from the company altogether on 30 September.</p>
      <p>However, it added that, “in order to ensure a smooth transition and successful peak season, Mr Abney will remain as a special consultant through [to] the end of 2020”.</p>
      <p>William Johnson (pictured below), currently UPS lead independent director, will become non-executive chairman on 30 September.</p>
      <p>Ms Tomé has been a member of the UPS board since 2003 and is currently chair of the audit committee. Previously she was executive vice president and chief financial officer of The Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer in the US, for 18 years.</p>
      <p>“After a rigorous selection process involving both internal and external candidates, Carol was the clear choice,” said said Mr Johnson, who also serves as chair of the UPS nominating and corporate governance committee.</p>
      <p>“Carol is one of the most respected and talented leaders in corporate America and has a proven track record of driving growth at a global organisation, maximising shareholder value, developing talent and successfully executing against strategic priorities.</p>
      <p>“She has in-depth knowledge of UPS’s business, strategy and people, and is the right executive to lead the company at this important time in its transformation,” he added.</p>
      <p>Ms Tomé said: “I look forward to working with and further developing the talented management team and the company’s 495,000 employees to deliver for our customers and shareowners. David has led a remarkable transformation at UPS and I plan to build on his success.”</p>
      <p>The transition will bring to an end a 46-year career at UPS for Mr Abney (pictured below), who was appointed chief executive in 2014 and chairman in 2016.</p>
      <p>He served as chief operating officer from 2007, overseeing logistics, sustainability, engineering and all facets of the UPS transport network, and prior to that was president of UPS International.</p>
      <p>He has been involved in a number of UPS acquisitions, including Coyote, Marken, the Fritz companies, Sonic Air, Stolica, Lynx Express and Sino-Trans in China.</p>
      <p>He began his UPS career in 1974 as a package handler in a small facility in Greenwood, Mississippi, while attending Delta State University.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: “We congratulate David on a truly exceptional career at UPS. He has undertaken bold actions to place UPS at the forefront of the transport industry and position its global network and people to capitalise on emerging trends that will carry the company well into the future.”</p>
      <p>Mr Abney added: “UPS has been one of my life’s passions and through UPS I have been able to live the American dream. I am confident in the UPS management team and their capabilities to execute our strategies in the future. This is the right time for me to pass the baton.”</p>

    <title>CMA CGM may have to sell a piece of Ceva as it faces limited liquidity options</title>

      <p>CMA CGM could be forced to sell a minority stake in Ceva Logistics, barely a year after it took over the operator, as it seeks to reduce its growing debt mountain and improve its liquidity position.</p>
      <p>As noted in this week’s Loadstar Premium, the French carrier’s reported core ebit of €1.13bn ($1.28bn) was overshadowed by its annual debt interest bill of €1.39bn.</p>
      <p>And the French carrier is now faced with increasingly limited options as it bids to reduce its debt, according to new analysis from Alphaliner today, which noted that “CMA CGM said the current bond prices would not support the issuance of new bonds and it will consider various options to improve its liquidity position”.</p>
      <p>The liner shipping analyst said the line’s options to raise cash included: “the sale of remaining unencumbered vessel and container equipment assets that are valued at about $400m; the sale of remaining 17 terminal assets that have not been sold to the China Merchants Ports joint venture; and the sale of a minority stake in CEVA Logistics”.</p>
      <p>CMA CGM currently has six bonds issued, for a combined total of $2.9bn, which are due for maturity between September this year and January 2025, while total debt to be repaid within two years amounts to $5.3bn.</p>
      <p>“Investor concerns over CMA CGM’s weak liquidity position have seen the price of the carrier’s five-year bonds drop to a low of just 61 cents on the euro, with some $1.2bn of its outstanding bonds coming due in 2020 and 2021,” Alphaliner explained.</p>
      <p>Loadstar Premium editor Alessandro Pasetti said the bond market was pricing-in a debt restructuring or possible default, but added: “We have seen CMA CGM bounce back many times with creative ideas.”</p>
      <p>The possibility of a part-sale of Ceva Logistics was mooted in an interview with CMA CGM chief financial officer Michael Sirat in Loadstar Premium last October.</p>
      <p>“Mr Sirat confirmed that CMA CGM would not retain 100% of Ceva’s equity capital, but would retain a majority stake as it was ‘actively’ looking at possible options,” it reported.</p>
      <p>According to The Loadstar sources, this could amount to as much as 40% of the unit being hived-off, although market interest has been low in recent months.</p>

      <p>With the coronavirus crisis disrupting automotive assembly lines, suppliers are increasingly looking to ad hoc airfreight for help.</p>
      <p>On-demand freight platform Cargobase has seen a 40% uptick in expedited volumes since the crisis began.</p>
      <p>“About 60% of the shippers using us are tier-1 or -2 suppliers to the car manufacturers, who usually use the platform for ‘expedites’ or tool moves. Now, they use the platform to find solutions in order to avoid potential disruptions of their manufacturing process,” said the company.</p>
      <p>Cargobase shipments to and from China have doubled, and there’s also been a “strong increase” between Europe and North America.</p>
      <p>“Large part-manufacturers are trying to share inventory globally, but also source from alternative suppliers for parts,” said Wiebe Helder, Cargobase’s chief executive.</p>
      <p>“From what we’ve heard, the situation is seriously going to affect manufacturers in the next few weeks, as they won’t receive supplies that usually come in by ocean freight. That gap might deplete their inventory, leaving them no choice but look at airfreight alternatives,” he added.</p>
      <p>In Italy, which entered a China-like lockdown this week, there has been no disruption to air cargo operations so far, according to forwarders, although many passenger flights have been cancelled.</p>
      <p>The epicentre of the outbreak in Italy is the country’s northern manufacturing heartland, where around half of all production is linked to the automotive industry. Carmakers such as BMW, Daimler, Fiat, Peugeot and Volkswagen have reportedly been able to keep assembly lines moving, using air cargo in some cases for shipments normally reserved for sea or road freight.</p>
      <p>Despite passenger flight cancellations worldwide, Cargobase saw a 55% increase in February bookings for onboard couriers, compared with January. It said the service allowed commercial shipments to be transported via carry-on or check-in baggage, therefore bypassing airport loading and collection times while remaining compliant with customs regulations.</p>
      <p>“An onboard courier service is often used out of China to expedite exports, as the time to request for permits to organise air charters can take over a week,” the company explained.</p>
      <p>Global airfreight rates have spiked due to the reduction in bellyhold capacity – The Loadstar reported yesterday that ad hoc rates are expected to reach $10 per kg.</p>
      <p>Cargobase noted a 50% increase in express airfreight “cost avoidance” – a calculation of the average quotation received, minus the booked quote.</p>
      <p>“This indicates that average quotations received have experienced a surge, possibly due to providers raising rates due to the urgent situation.”</p>
      <p>To respond to the growing demand, Cargobase has launched a new service to allow shippers to use the platform within 24 hours of signing up, instead of the usual two-week onboarding process.</p>
      <p>“More than ever, shippers have an urgent need to know what they are spending on freight caused by the disruption. For some, it is to make business decisions, and for others it is to claim back cost  to suppliers or customers,” said Mr Helder.</p>
      <p>“These are the times that the volume of emails increases significantly and people lose track of what is going on, while management still needs full transparency. Our platform helps with that.”</p>

      <p>OOCL says it will be able to run a standalone Asia-North Europe loop following the delivery of five 23,000 teu newbuilds in 2023.</p>
      <p>Parent Orient Overseas (International) Ltd (OOIL), a subsidiary of Cosco Shipping, said it had entered into “arm’s length” commercial newbuild contracts with state-owned Cosco shipyards, Nantong Cosco KHI Ship Engineering for two vessels and Dalian Cosco for three, at $156m per unit.</p>
      <p>“Based on the group’s evaluation on price, technical terms and delivery schedule, the Nantong and Dalian offers were the best among bidders,” said OOIL.</p>
      <p>There would likely have been no shortage of bidders, given that the containership orderbook-to-fleet ratio is at its lowest since the 1980s.</p>
      <p>However, the South Korean yards and others would have been stretched to compete with the subsidised China state-owned yards and the flexible financing programmes provided by domestic banks.</p>
      <p>OOIL said it envisaged bank financing to be arranged “for about 60% of the contract price of each vessel”, with the balance “funded from internal resources”.</p>
      <p>The company explained: “These five new buildings are part of our ongoing programme to introduce large, modern, and fuel-efficient vessels to further strengthen our fleet competitiveness, as well as fleet rebalancing, by increasing the proportion of the ships we own in the core fleet, while a number of vessels leased under long-term charters will be returned to the owners.”</p>
      <p>The carrier currently owns six 21,000 teu ULCVs deployed on the Asia-North Europe route, which was the “first step” in expansion plans postponed by the “terrible market conditions of 2016”, and which subsequently resulted in a $6.3bn deal for Cosco to acquire OOIL in 2017.</p>
      <p>It said the announcement of the mega-ship order was the “long-awaited second step” of the strategic plan.</p>
      <p>“We will have the potential to independently form a complete loop in the Asia-Europe trade, where we intend to deploy them in order to strengthen OOCL’s overall competitive position in the market and improve services to customers.</p>
      <p>“Balancing this expansion, over the next five years we plan to return or dispose of 13 vessels from our fleet, a total of around 76,000 teu.”</p>
      <p>Currently, OOCL partners with parent Cosco, CMA CGM and Evergreen in the Ocean Alliance, which was extended last year to run until 2027.</p>
      <p>However, the Cosco group could be keeping its longer-term options open in the case of a further reshuffling of alliance membership, should there be another liner bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>OOCL said the new vessels would “help to bring economies of scale to OOCL’s unit cost structure”.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to say that the latest engine technology and other state-of-the-art equipment will be used to achieve greater operational efficiency and reduce carbon emission,” said the carrier.</p>
      <p>There was however no mention of the newbuild ships having scrubbers installed.</p>
      <p>The cost advantages of the exhaust gas cleaning systems have become much less attractive, given the spread between compliant low-sulphur fuel and heavy fuel oil, used by scrubber-fitted ships, has fallen to $80 per ton, from the approximate $250 difference when the IMO regulations came into force on 1 January.</p>

      <p>Evofenedex, the Dutch trade and logistics association, has urged its government to scrap its proposed ‘environmental’ air cargo tax, which it claims could “kill air freight facilities” in the country.</p>
      <p>The government has opted for a tax on the maximum take-off weight, penalising larger aircraft, which, Evofenedex pointed out, hits particularly hard newer and cleaner aircraft.</p>
      <p>The group also pointed out that the tax would lead to “leakage” and therefore not the revenue the government was hoping for.</p>
      <p>“The tax alone will kill the air freight facilities at Maastricht Airport,” said chairman Steven Lak.</p>
      <p>“In addition, the council of state has already expressed great concern about the leakage effect of cargo flights to foreign airports as a result of this measure and its impact on our business climate and prosperity.</p>
      <p>“The spread of the coronavirus forces the aviation sector to cancel many flights. As a result, we are now close to a knockout for a large part of the air cargo facilities in the Netherlands. ”</p>
      <p>The Dutch government is expecting to raise some €200m ($227m) through the tax, which is designed, claims Evofenedex, to close a budget gap, rather than helping make aviation more sustainable. Cargo’s portion will be €12m.</p>
      <p>“Due to the levy, many cargo flights will be relocated abroad, where there is no levy on freight aircraft. Because the total revenue is based on the number of flights with freight aircraft in the Netherlands, and the leakage effect is not taken into account, the revenue for the treasury will simply be lower,” said the association.</p>
      <p>Evofenedex is arguing instead for a European variant of the tax, under the Green Deal.</p>
      <p>“The EU variant maintains a level playing field, stimulates innovation and does make air freight more sustainable. And that is smarter,” said Mr Lak.</p>
      <p>“We don’t get it. The levy slows the sustainability of air freight shipments, possibly curbs the air freight market and provides the government with less financial means than it thinks. This should therefore be smarter.”</p>
      <p>Evofenedex joins Air Cargo Netherlands and IATA in lobbying against the proposal.</p>

    <title>Delta, American cutbacks add to global airline meltdown on virus</title>

      <p>Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. walked away from their 2020 forecasts and said they will slash operations because of the coronavirus outbreak, joining carriers across the globe grappling with one of the worst crises in modern air travel.</p>
      <p>Delta plans to cut domestic capacity as much as 15% and international flights by 25%, the Atlanta-based carrier said in a statement Tuesday. The company also will freeze hiring and suspend share buybacks. American said it would reduce U.S. service 7.5% in April and cut foreign flights by 10% for the peak summer season.</p>
      <p>The adjustments illustrate the depth of the crisis for carriers worldwide as the virus’s spread upends economies and prompts travelers to stay home. An airline trade group said last week that the industry will lose as much as $113 billion in sales because of the virus, while Jefferies anticipates the biggest annual drop in commercial air traffic since at least the 1970s.</p>
      <p>Already this week, Qantas Airways Ltd. grounded most of its A380 jets, slashed management pay and cut about a quarter of international service for six months; Air France-KLM said its main Paris-based arm would cancel 3,600 flights this month; Finnair Oyj outlined plans to eliminate 2,400 short-distance services in April; and JetBlue Airways Corp. withdrew its 2020 forecast. United Airlines Holdings Inc. abandoned its 2020 forecasts last month.</p>
      <p>Cost Cuts</p>
      <p>“As the virus has spread, we have seen a decline in demand across all entities,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in the statement. “As a result, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to immediately reduce capacity and are implementing cost reductions and cash flow initiatives across the organization.”</p>
      <p>Despite the pain for airlines, U.S. carriers rose Tuesday amid a broad market rally following a historic rout the previous day. Delta climbed 3.4% to $44.99 at 10:02 AM in New York, while American jumped 6.7% to $15.74. A Standard &amp; Poor’s index of major U.S. carriers tumbled 32% this year through Monday, dragged down by the outbreak.</p>
      <p>Adding to the uncertainty for the airline industry, a Trump administration economic package to be unveiled Tuesday will leave out aid for the travel industry, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. While the White House wants to find a way to help reeling airlines, as well as hospitality companies, administration officials remained uncertain about the best way to do so.</p>
      <p>As a show of good faith during tough times, some airline executives have said they would give back some of their compensation. United CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby will give up their base salaries through at least June 30, the carrier said. At Southwest Airlines Co., CEO Gary Kelly said he would take a 10% pay cut amid the drop in bookings, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p>

      <p>CEVA Logistics has opened its own offices in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh, in support of its strategic expansion into the emerging Southeast Asian markets.</p>
      <p>The new head office in Dhaka and operational office in Chittagong were open as of March 9, and will offer freight management services such as purchase order management, container freight station (CFS), customs brokerage and project management, among others.</p>
      <p>CEVA has been operational in Bangladesh through local partners for 17 years, and is opening its own, fully staffed offices in response to the country’s continuing economic growth and increasing demand for exports.</p>
      <p>“Bangladesh is strategically located to support trading with multiple region,” said Russell Pang, managing director emerging markets for CEVA. These markets include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. “It has developed a mature and stable market of exports with the U.S., Europe and China. Our vision is to add greater value and increase service options to the market, notably the textile and garment industries, in addition to the increasing new higher value chain verticals of electronics, technology and health care.”</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, currently the third-largest economy in South Asia, is expected to grow the fastest in the region — by 7.2% in fiscal year 2019-20, according to projections from the World Bank, CEVA stated in a press release. According to CEVA, underlying this projection are the country’s solid macroeconomic framework, political stability, implementation of planned public infrastructure projects and ongoing reforms to improve the business environment.</p>
      <p>CEVA Logistics is a global logistics and supply chain company in both freight management and contract logistics with $7 billion in revenues. Founded in 2007 as a merger of TNT Logistics and EGL Eagle Global Logistics, its head office is located in Baar, Switzerland.</p>

      <p>Deutsche Lufthansa AG slashed capacity by as much as 50% in the most aggressive move yet by a major European airline to cope with the severe fall-off in travel triggered by the coronavirus.</p>
      <p>The German airline group cited “drastic declines in bookings and numerous flight cancellations” in recent days, saying all of its traffic is now affected. The carrier’s board decided Friday to reduce capacity even more than it previously had planned, it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“This measure is intended to reduce the financial consequences of the slump in demand,” Lufthansa said. “It complements the planned savings measures in personnel, material costs and project budgets as well as other liquidity measures.”</p>
      <p>Carriers across the globe are cutting back to cope with an oubreak that has rapidly curtailed worldwide air traffic as it spreads from China. Airline stocks in Europe and the U.S. have taken a major hit this week, as the companies scrambled to adjust schedules that had already been tweaked with the expectation the virus would be contained in Asia.</p>
      <p>The International Air Transport Association estimated carriers may lose as much as $113 billion in ticket sales this year — an impact from the epidemic almost four times greater than it had forecast just two weeks earlier.</p>
      <p>All told, Lufthansa shares have lost 23% in the past month, while British Airways parent IAG SA is down 31% and Air France-KLM tumbled 48%. Transatlantic discounter Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, perennially under financial strain, is off more than two-thirds. In the U.S., United Airlines Holdings Inc. skidded 36%, while Delta Airlines Inc. and American Airlines Inc. have declined 21% and 51%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa acted after investors started to question its ability to withstand the downturn. The company’s 5-year credit default swaps, which bondholders buy to protect their holdings against a potential default, more than tripled in the last 10 trading days to the most expensive level in seven years.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the German airline said it had idled capacity translating into about 150 of its aircraft. Grounding half of its about 770-strong fleet would be more than twice that. Lufthansa said it’s considering taking its entire fleet of 14 Airbus A380 super-jumbos out of service in Frankfurt and Munich.</p>
      <p>In another sign of concern, two British Airways baggage handlers at London Heathrow tested positive for the disease, potentially spelling trouble for travel at Europe’s largest hub.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa a week ago said it would extend capacity cuts beyond long-haul flights to and from China, initially the only routes affected, to also cover short-haul flights across Europe after the coronavirus spread to Italy, the group’s second-most-important foreign market.</p>

      <p>Kerry Logistics Network Limited has moved its air freight division in the U.K. into a new facility close to London Heathrow Airport (LHR) as its air freight operations continue to expand.</p>
      <p>The Hong Kong-based, third-party logistics company now occupies 40,000 square feet of warehouse space as it gears up to manage the continued growth of its air freight division, particularly in pharmaceuticals and perishables, including shellfish and seafood. The facility provides a 24/7, temperature-controlled, bonded warehouse that includes deep frozen storage, pick-and-pack machinery, vacuum cooling and other operations to meet tight delivery schedules and product shelf life requirements.</p>
      <p>“The new facility will allow us to accommodate the growth in our air freight volumes and help us grow our presence in different verticals,” said David Mallinson, general manager of Kerry Logistics’ U.K. Air Division.</p>
      <p>Mallinson added that the new site also offers full customs clearance and real-time tracking. Additionally, the facility has achieved a rating of AA+ under the new BRC Global Standard for Food Safety Issue 8.</p>

      <p>The impact of the novel coronavirus on the freight transportation industry appears to be growing, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey, which found that approximately 80% of stakeholders’ businesses were impacted by COVID-19, compared to around 60% just two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Results from the survey of more than 350 shippers, brokers and carriers overwhelmingly point to industry members’ expectation that the coronavirus impact will expand in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Although some shippers and carriers said they believe this reaction is overblown, they expressed concerns about West Coast and export-related business.</p>
      <p>While only 50% of respondents said they believe the current impact is still “low,” when asked about the impact in three months’ time, the number of respondents expecting “no impact” dropped to less than 15%. Additionally, the total share of stakeholders who believe the current level of impact is “medium” or “high” has doubled in the last two weeks, jumping to around 30%.</p>
      <p>The survey also found that half of those surveyed believe the level of impact will be “medium” or “high” in the next three months, up from 30% who believed this two weeks ago. However, commentary remains mixed as to what exactly what would constitute “medium” to “high” levels of impact.</p>
      <p>Brokers, more so than shippers and carriers, expressed the most negative outlook on the effects of COVID-19 on business, with one respondent saying it was not only a disaster in the short term but might precipitate a global economic downturn.</p>
      <p>Positive commentary, coming mainly from shippers, highlighted the spikes in demand from grocers and other retail partners, as consumers respond to the outbreak by hoarding products like canned food.</p>

      <p>Bin Yousef Cargo, which has a dedicated equine department, was awarded the contract for handling equine logistics for both the Concours Hippique International (CHI) Al Shaqab and the Longines Global Champions Tour. The contract saw Bin Yousef Cargo manage the travel arrangements for more than 150 horses, which raced in the two events.</p>
      <p>CHI Al Shaqab took place from February 27-29 and the Longines Global Champions Tour took place from March 5-7, both in Qatar. </p>
      <p>Bin Yousef Cargo’s director of cargo operations at, Jiju Haneef, commented: “Modern fleets of freighters with controlled temperature zones, comfortable and spacious horse stalls and experienced groomers accompanying these horses [are factors that] motivate horse owners around the world, to send their champions to Qatar.</p>
      <p>“The state-of-the-art, on-ground live animal facilities such as air-conditioned holding stalls, a paddock as well as on-site veterinary personnel in Qatar, assures the care, comfort, safety and reliability required for the smooth and stress-free transportation of each equine guest that we handle.”</p>
      <p>Celebrating its thirty-fifth year of operation, Bin Yousef Cargo is one of the leading logistics providers in the region, offering air and sea freight forwarding, along with customs clearance, and warehousing and distribution services – all while delivering timely operational support.</p>
      <p>Bin Yousef Cargo has also provided logistics services for sporting events such as the World Cycling Championships in Doha and ATP Qatar ExxonMobil Open.</p>

      <p>IBS Software has signed a five-year contract with Lufthansa Cargo to host and maintain the carrier’s iCAP cargo handling application.</p>
      <p>After having evaluated the capabilities of hosting service providers on factors such as “application availability, security regulatory and data privacy”, Lufthansa Cargo selected IBS Software’s SaaS (software as a service) platform as part of its move to focus on its “core cargo business without compromising on IT operations”.</p>
      <p>As a result of its partnership, Lufthansa Cargo will benefit from IBS Software’s “zero outage” functionality, which enables planned maintenance to be carried out with disruption to Lufthansa Cargo’s IT system.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for IBS Software explained: “This unique capability results in operational stability, which is essential to fulfill the customer promise and to provide effective and seamless cargo handling operations around the clock across all time zones without any service disruptions.</p>
      <p>“Lufthansa Cargo will also benefit from superior and faster application performance of highly complex cargo business functions and processes. As an example, Lufthansa Cargo processes one million messages per day. Each message will now be processed noticeably faster than before in less than one second on the IBS Software SaaS platform.”</p>
      <p>Initial running of the system, which operates from IBS Software’s new data centre in Frankfurt, has shown that the SaaS service has exceeded parameters set by Lufthansa Cargo and with service-level agreement compliance.</p>

      <p>The British International Freight Association (BIFA) is celebrating the first anniversary of its Young Forwarders Network (YFN).</p>
      <p>BIFA launched the YFN, which involves events run by young forwarders in regional networks, in March 2019.</p>
      <p>Since its establishment a year ago, six regional networks have been formed and more than 20 YFN events have been held.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the YFN events is to help young talent and BIFA members to enhance their knowledge and skills in a structured, social environment.</p>
      <p>According to Carl Hobbis (pictured), BIFA’s training development manager, more than 400 young individuals have attended the networking events, “which gives a clear demonstration of their perceived value by the younger generation in the freight forwarding and logistics sector”.</p>
      <p>Hobbis commented: “Each event they attend – whether that is a tour or a talk from an industry professional – they return to the workplace with more knowledge.</p>
      <p>“When the YFN was launched, we said we thought it would prove to be a major step forward for the industry in developing its future freight forwarding ambassadors and leaders.</p>
      <p>“The young people who are joining the various regional groups are improving their knowledge of the sector, trends within it, as well as building their skill sets and learning from others.”</p>

      <p>Airfreight rates from China increased rapidly last week as demand from China begins to ramp up but spare capacity remains tight.</p>
      <p>The latest figures from TAC Index show that last week average airfreight prices from Shanghai to North America increased by 32.3% on a week earlier to $4.02 per kg, while prices from the Chinese city to Europe jumped by 15.8% compared with the prior seven days to $2.71 per kg.</p>
      <p>Prices from Shanghai to North America are now above the $3.29 per kg that carriers were charging on the route at the corresponding point last year and to Europe they are just slightly lower than the $2.75 per kg reported in early March 2019.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, prices from Hong Kong to North America increased by 11.5% week on week to $3.59 per kg and there was a 3.2% increase to $2.58 per kg on services to Europe.</p>
      <p>The price jump from China comes as factories continue to ramp up production following an extend Chinese New Year break as part of efforts to contain the coronavirus.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, capacity remains tight as passenger flights – and therefore belly space – has been cut.</p>
      <p>Peter Stallion of derivatives broker FIS said the price spike doesn’t really come as a surprise.</p>
      <p>He adds that carriers are set to benefit from an emerging price war between oil producing OPEC states and Russia.</p>
      <p>“However, the ongoing impacts of coronavirus dull the benefits of lower input costs, whilst the high airfreight price, although beneficial to the global freighter fleet, cannot be booked as revenue due to the missing belly capacity,” Stallion said.</p>
      <p>“Thus, we’ve seen carriers with a highly abundant fleet of parked passenger aircraft utilise these assets to provide much needed cargo lift.”</p>
      <p>Cathay’s passenger only cargo flights</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Air Cargo News sister title FlightGlobal has reported that following cuts made to its Japan passenger network, Cathay Pacific is considering operating cargo-only services on its passenger aircraft.</p>
      <p>In a notice sent out to its clients, Cathay’s cargo arm says it only expects passenger belly cargo operations to be impacted by recently-announced cuts. However, it is looking at ways to “continue serving our cargo customers to and from Japan”.</p>
      <p>“This includes the retention of certain passenger services for cargo carriage only,” the notice reads.</p>
      <p>Cathay cut most of its flights to and from Japan for March, following newly-imposed travel restrictions – related to the coronavirus outbreak – by Japanese authorities, which said Chinese and Hong Kong passport holders will face a mandatory, two-week quarantine on arrival.</p>
      <p>From 9 March, the airline cut all passenger flights between Hong Kong and Fukuoka, Nagoya, Sapporo, as well as Tokyo Haneda. From 13 March, Tokyo Narita and Osaka Kansai, as well as services between Taipei and Tokyo Narita and Osaka Kansai, will be cancelled.</p>
      <p>The carrier says its freighter operations to Japan remain unaffected. “We will communicate a revised schedule in a timely manner,” it adds.</p>
      <p>Beleaguered Cathay has recently cut capacity across its network, after the coronavirus outbreak hit its already-weakened performance.</p>

      <p>As part of its strategic expansion in the emerging Southeast Asian markets, CEVA Logistics has opened its own offices in Dhaka and Chittagong.</p>
      <p>The logistics firm has been operational in textiles hotspot Bangladesh for 17 years through a network partner, providing logistics services to a number of multinational and local customers.</p>
      <p>The company has now decided to open its own offices with a fully-staffed team in order to meet the country’s continuing economic expansion and increasing demand for exports.</p>
      <p>Its lead office will be located in downtown Dhaka, complemented by an operational office in Chittagong, Bangladesh’s second largest city.</p>
      <p>Through these offices, CEVA will offer a “full range of freight management solutions including purchase order management, CFS (container freight station), customs brokerage, project management and other value-added services”.</p>
      <p>CEVA pointed to statistics showing that Bangladesh, currently the third-largest economy in South Asia, is expected to grow the fastest in the region (by 7.2%) in 2019-20 according to projections from the World Bank.</p>
      <p>“A solid macroeconomic framework, political stability, implementation of planned public infrastructure projects and ongoing reforms to improve the business environment, underlie this projection,” CEVA said.</p>
      <p>Russell Pang, managing director emerging markets (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar), CEVA Logistics, added: “Bangladesh is strategically located to support trading with multiple regions. It has developed a mature and stable market of exports with the US, Europe, and China.</p>
      <p>“Our vision is to add greater value and increase service options to the market, notably the textile and garment industries, in addition to the increasing new higher value chain verticals of electronics, technology and healthcare. We look forward to developing our service profile in line with the increasing demands of our customers.”</p>

      <p>A new £200m logistics and industrial park is being developed at Teesside International Airport in the north east of England.</p>
      <p>A groundbreaking ceremony was held at the start of the month and infrastructure work is now set to begin on the project that will see the creation of 3.4m sq ft of logistics, manufacturing and commercial space built on 270 acres of land at the southside of the airport.</p>
      <p>“Once complete, the development has the potential to create 4,400 jobs and deliver £3m per year to reinvest into the airport,” Tees Valley Combined Authority said.</p>
      <p>The southside land, comprising 270 acres and running parallel to the runway, is the largest area for such a development and will be carried out under a joint venture partnership.</p>
      <p>The Tees Valley Mayor and Combined Authority previously committed to an investment of £23.6m for the development of critical infrastructure, including connecting the site to the main utilities and providing access to the Southside of the airport from the A67.</p>
      <p>Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said: “Hot on the heels announcing summer flights to Alicante for this summer, and the introduction of six new routes across UK and Ireland rolling out now, today I’ve broken ground on the next huge project to secure the future of Teesside Airport.</p>
      <p>“Ever since bringing our airport back into public ownership, I have always said that for it to succeed, we need to be supporting our businesses as well as attracting flights to fantastic destinations for consumers.</p>
      <p>“Today is the next step in achieving a sustainable, appropriate development around our airport, providing a high quality site for businesses, a huge number of which have already expressed an interest at being based here.</p>
      <p>“Not only that, it will help create thousands of good-quality jobs for local people and make sure our airport will be here for years to come, with money from the site reinvested into our airport.”</p>

      <p>Broker Air Charter Service (ACS) has opened a new office in Chicago as it continues its US expansion.</p>
      <p>The office, which is the broker’s tenth in the US, will be headed up by Caitlin Uhlmann, who has worked at ACS for nine years at the company’s offices in Los Angeles, London and Manhattan offices.</p>
      <p>Richard Thompson, ACS Americas’ president, said: “Chicago has been on our radar as a natural location for another US ACS office for a number of years. The city is the third largest in population in the US and has one of the highest GDPs in the world – generating $689bn last year.</p>
      <p>“O’Hare Airport is the sixth busiest in the world and the city is home to many Fortune 500 companies, some of whom are household names. We believe that there is a large market for both our passenger and cargo aircraft charter services here.</p>
      <p>“We have been conducting business with clients from Chicago and the rest of Illinois for many years and are looking forward to building closer relationships with them, as well as welcoming new customers on board.”</p>
      <p>Thompson concluded: “Uhlmann has been instrumental in setting up our last few US offices and I am extremely confident that she is the right person for the job and I’m looking forward to the progression of the new office under her leadership.”</p>

      <p>TIACA has signed an memorandum of understanding (MOU) with CLIVE Data Services to create and deliver air cargo market and route analyses to TIACA members.</p>
      <p>CLIVE, the creator of the new ‘dynamic load factor’ analysis, strives to give the earliest possible barometer of market analysis based on cargo data – volume and weight perspectives of the cargo flown and capacity available – shared by a representative group of global airlines.</p>
      <p>Under the terms of the MOU, CLIVE will provide market data for TIACA’s Cargo Pulse newsletter and social media platforms, and for speakers at TIACA conferences.</p>
      <p>Steven Polmans, chairman of TIACA, explained: “As part of the transformation of TIACA, we are promising to deliver more content to our growing membership – but only content of value to their businesses and which accurately represents and promotes the global air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>“CLIVE’s dynamic load factor [analysis] is registering a lot of interest because it breaks with tradition and is changing the way air cargo usage is measured based on the realities of today’s market. It is also the fastest source of data, which is also very appealing for our members.”</p>
      <p>Niall van de Wouw, managing director of CLIVE Data Services, added: “Working with TIACA enables us to put our market intelligence in front of a large group of respected decision-makers, who we hope will embrace our new load factor methodology.</p>
      <p>“This represents another important step forward in getting the industry to accept there is a new and more accurate way to measure how full flights are.”</p>
      <p>CLIVE Data Services, which also recently became a recent member of TIACA, will deliver its first market analyses to the Association’s members thislater month.</p>

      <p>Luxembourg Airport has selected Nallian to implement a cargo community system (CCS) in order to offer a neutral data sharing platform for businesses based at the hub.</p>
      <p>The airport said that the CCS represented an important component of the Luxembourg Single Window for Logistics programme and will be open to all actors involved in international trade.</p>
      <p>The CCS will enable real-time capturing and sharing of granular information regarding shipment processing, to “better plan and execute” processes and “drive efficiency and visibility with in-depth insights in performance”.</p>
      <p>The first phase of the roll out will cover perishable and live animal shipments and will only be available to Cargolux, LuxairCargo, Kuehne+Nagel, Arthur Welter and the public administrations concerned.</p>
      <p>The CCS will then be rolled out to all types of cargo and all companies that are interested to join.</p>
      <p>René Steinhaus, chief executive of lux-Airport, said: “Lux-Airport is excited to implement, together with its cargo community, a data sharing platform.</p>
      <p>“With this decision lux-Airport demonstrates its commitment to support the airport cargo community and to foster the competitiveness and further growth of Luxembourg as a European multimodal logistics hub.”</p>
      <p>In 2019 Luxembourg airport handled 893,090 tons of cargo.</p>

      <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) Cargo, the first airline in the Asia Pacific region to be gain CEIV Pharma certification in 2017, has received renewed certification from IATA.</p>
      <p>The renewed certification comes after SIA expanded its cool chain corridor with the addition of pharma-handling hubs in Copenhagen, Osaka and Stockholm.</p>
      <p>The new cool chain hub destinations are part of SIA’s expanding THRUCOOOL1 pharma corridor, launched in 2018 after initial certification from IATA a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Last year, SIA Cargo signed a three-year agreement with SkyCell that enabled it to lease of temperature-controlled containers designed to optimise the conditions for pharmaceutical products to be transported.</p>
      <p>Chin Yau Seng, SIA’s senior vice president of cargo, commented: “We are pleased that our IATA CEIV Pharma certification has been renewed after a re-certification audit. It reinforces the importance that we place on quality and reliability in the transportation of key pharmaceutical products.</p>
      <p>“We remain committed to rolling out THRUCOOL to more locations with the expansion of our quality corridor network, while also looking for new ways to further enhance the product.”</p>
      <p>Conrad Clifford, IATA ‘s regional vice president, Asia Pacific, added: “Cold chain logistics for pharmaceutical products is a growing segment of the air cargo business, with spending expected to grow 5-6% annually.</p>
      <p>“Singapore Airlines’ renewal of their CEIV Pharma certification ensures that they continue to be well placed to serve the needs of pharmaceutical companies and transport these time and temperature sensitive products to locations around the world where they are most needed while ensuring the product integrity.”</p>
      <p>IATA’s CEIV Pharma certification affirms an airline or businesses’ capability of handling time-sensitive and temperature-controlled cargo with integrity, reliability and efficiency.</p>

      <p>VRR has unveiled an updated design of its inflatable AKE container.</p>
      <p>VRR had planned to showcase the Air7, which it believes will be certified by the third quarter of 2020, at the IATA World Cargo Symposium. However the event was recently postponed due to coronavirus-related fears.</p>
      <p>A prototype of the inflatable AKE, named the Air5, was revealed at last year’s World Cargo Symposium in Singapore and the container design also won the interDESIGN excellence award at Inter Airport Europe 2019.</p>
      <p>Like the prototype, the Air7 can be inflated in seconds and collapsed in less than two minutes by two people.</p>
      <p>However, the Air7 has several also has improvements over the prototype, such as being weatherproof and having a lower folding height.</p>
      <p>Geert van Riemsdijk, managing director of VRR, explained: “Current methods of relocating ULDs are expensive and time consuming.”</p>
      <p>“A container that can be collapsed quickly and easily and then stacked seven high on a lower deck is a game changer for fleet managers.</p>
      <p>“That’s really going to help them cut costs and increase capacity. And we have not even discussed the cost saving when it comes to storage of the containers.”</p>
      <p>Going forward, VRR will incorporate new features into the Air7, such as a fire resistance and a thermal cover.</p>
      <p>“We’re exploring these options because specialised cargo such as perishables and lithium batteries are mostly transported on imbalanced routes with one-way
direction freight,” van Riemsdijk added. </p>

      <p>To mark International Women’s Day (March 8) Emirates SkyCargo has released a video (see below) following an all-women flight deck crew operating multi-stop B777F flights across four continents.</p>
      <p>Captain Ellen Roz from the US and first officer Heidi McDiarmid from Australia cover close to 30,000kms in 10 days on five freighter flights from Frankfurt to Mexico City onwards to Quito, Aguadilla, Amsterdam and finally to Dubai transporting over 300 tonnes of cargo ranging from fresh flowers and fruits to pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>The two pilots were also joined by captain Heather Wolf from Canada for operating the flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Over 75 tonnes of fresh flowers were transported on the freighter flights operated by Roz and McDiarmid from Quito to Aguadilla and from Aguadilla to Amsterdam.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>“Emirates’ freighter flights from Quito create a direct channel for exports for the Ecuadorian floriculture industry to Amsterdam, the world’s largest flower distribution hub,” the carrier said.</p>
      <p>“This supports the local economy in Ecuador and the livelihoods of over 100,000 people in the country who work to cultivate and harvest flowers.</p>
      <p>“Freighter flights also allow for rapid transportation of goods such as life-saving medication from the location where they are manufactured to patients who may urgently need them for treatment. Close to 10 tonnes of valuable pharmaceuticals were transported on the freighter flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City operated by the all-women flight deck crew.”</p>
      <p>Emirates said that women constitute more than 40% of its total workforce with the majority working as cabin crew. Emirates’ female pilots come from over 30 nationalities, covering an age range from 23 to 62 years.</p>
      <p>Women from over 160 nationalities, including more than 1,100 Emiratis, are employed across the Emirates Group in operational roles in functions including flight operations, engineering, aircraft maintenance and appearance, catering, cargo and ramp operations; in customer facing roles in airport services, sales and customer affairs and corporate roles across business support functions.</p>

      <p>Japan Airlines (JAL) has signed up to use IBS Software’s cargo management software as it seeks efficiencies in its IT operations.</p>
      <p>The Japan-based carried will replace multiple legacy systems with IBS’s iCargo Terminal Operations solution for Japan to manage the entire operations process covering the import, export, transfers, warehouse operations and airports operations across the network. It will also implement iCargo for its cargo sales, inventory and reservations.</p>
      <p>“Along with significant savings in legacy system maintenance costs, JAL will also benefit from major efficiency improvements through the iCargo solution,” IBS Software said in a release.</p>
      <p>IBS claims iCargo is the only non-Japanese system in this market that has full Japanese Customs NACCS reporting capabilities.</p>
      <p>“The real time availability of operational information through iCargo also helps generate actionable intelligence to understand the overall utilization of assets and thereby improve operational efficiencies,” the company said. </p>
      <p>Ashok Rajan, senior vice-president and head, cargo and logistics solution business, IBS Software, said: “JAL is an iconic name in the airline industry and we are proud to welcome them to the iCargo community.</p>
      <p>“Their aim is to drive efficiency improvements and iCargo, the leader and IT platform of choice for airlines especially in the Japanese market, will help their transformation into digital freight.”</p>

    <title>Etihad Cargo sees volumes and revenues fall in 2019</title>

      <p>Etihad Cargo saw both cargo volumes and revenues fall in 2019 as a result of fleet rationalisation programme and a weak market.</p>
      <p>The Abu Dhabi headquartered carrier saw 2019 cargo volumes fall by 6.9% year on year to 635,000 tonnes, while total revenues fell by 15.7% year on year to $700m,</p>
      <p>This decline is mostly attributable to the full-year effect of belly-hold and freighter capacity rationalisation undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2018, combined with adverse market conditions that resulted in yields dropping by 7.8%.</p>
      <p>IATA estimates that the overall cargo market declined by 3.3% last year.</p>
      <p>The carrier said it “remained committed to its transformation in 2019” despite the “challenging market headwinds”.</p>
      <p>Etihad has reduced its freighter fleet and invested in its digital services over the last couple of years.</p>
      <p>It also recently entered into a major GSA partnership with the ECS Group.</p>
      <p>“Underlying transformation results were visible in the fourth quarter, having recorded a 5.6% increase in FTKs over the same period in 2018, with 1.7 percentage points higher load factors,” the carrier said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the overall Etihad business saw revenues drop by around 5.4% to €5.6bn while losses were reduced to $870m, compared with $1.3bn last year.</p>

      <p>“The platform represents an excellent channel for effectively marketing products to freight forwarders with fast lead times, better exposure, and less complicated processing than with traditional channels.</p>

      <p>From today (Friday 13), individuals from 23 countries in the European Union will not be permitted to travel to the US, due to US’ fears about the spread of coronavirus.</p>
      <p>In response to the news, United Airlines Cargo explained that to compensate the Europe restrictions, it is adding additional road feeder capacity to feed cargo into other routes in its global network.</p>
      <p>In a statement, United explained: “We will continue to utilise additional trucking and interline options to serve you. Please contact your United Cargo Sales professional to inquire about and/or book this space”.</p>
      <p>The carrier also thanked its customers for their “loyalty and understanding during this challenging time”.</p>
      <p>Although the ban imposed by the US does not apply to cargo, Delta Cargo is refraining from shipping live animals and human remains while the restrictions are in place.</p>
      <p>Live animals human remains are “Embargoed effective immediately until further notice on all flights to, from and through Europe and the UK”, Delta Cargo informed.</p>
