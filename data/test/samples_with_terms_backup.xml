      <p>Ethiopian Airlines is improving the quality of its climate-controlled services through the use of DoKaSch Temperature Solutions' Opticooler container.</p>
      <p>The Opticooler is equipped with battery powered cooling compressors and heaters as well as a self regulating temperature control, so that temperature sensitive goods, in particular pharmaceuticals such as insulin and vaccines, stay within range at any point in the storage area.</p>
      <p>The airline has also signed a master agreement with the German ULD provider and has also opened the largest cargo terminal in Africa at its hub in Addis Ababa.</p>
      <p>The Addis Ababa hub focuses on handling temperature sensitive goods, and since February, Ethiopian Airlines has offered the DoKaSch active container to fly goods through the hub.</p>
      <p>Ethiopian Cargo &amp; Logistics Services managing director, Fitsum Abady says: "We are very glad to offer our customers a highly reliable packaging solution to transport temperature-sensitive shipments with DoKaSch's Opticooler.</p>
      <p>"In this fast growing and strongly competitive market, it is important that we offer our customers the best packaging solution for their sensitive cargo."</p>
      <p>DoKaSch Temperature Solutions managing director, Andreas Seitz says: "Ethiopian Airlines is the most successful African carrier and their hub in Addis Ababa develops very positive regarding the cargo handlings. Therefore, we are very pleased, that we could expand our African network by signing the master agreement with Ethiopian Airlines."</p>

      <p>Brussels Airlines Cargo has switched its GSSA from European Cargo Services (ECS) to Air Logistics Group for belly-hold space on its passenger services. The carrier said the decision to break with its representative of 13 years was part of "an ambitious strategic plan to further grow its cargo business." It said it marked "a new era in which Brussels Airlines wishes to get even closer to the customer" in its freight activities. Cargo has become an increasingly important activity for the Belgian carrier, with over 41,000 tonnes transported on its routes, which major on Africa but also include the US and the rest of Europe. Freight volumes have grown by double digits over the last five â€“ and by 34% on North Atlantic routes and 8% in revenue terms on African routes. Brussels Airlines vice president sales Africa and cargo, Philippe Saeys-Desmedt explained: "Brussels Airlines Cargo is more than ever a strategic revenue contributor of our business and we foresee a further growth of our tonnage by 6 percent in 2016." ALG will represent Brussels Airlines Cargo worldwide from September 1 except for Africa, where the carrier will continue to represent itself. The carrier already offers a 'Fresh-to-shelf' service for perishable goods from Africa and to launch new products to serve other market segments in the next few months. Saeys-Desmedt added: "This cooperation will allow us to continue to raise Brussels Airlines Cargo's unique cargo brand to our customers, thanks to a dedicated sales team in Brussels and a vast worldwide network of agencies." ALG's chief operating officer Stephen Dawkins said: "Together we are very complementary, as we have extensive experience in the Asian and US markets, while Brussels Airlines is the Africa expert, with their unique and comprehensive network of destinations on the continent. "We will work together very closely to meet their customer's high expectations, so as Brussels Airlines Cargo can build an even stronger market position."</p>

      <p>Qatar Airways Group chief executive Akbar Al Baker hinted that his airline could place orders for further 747-8 freighter aircraft from Boeing, at a handover for the first of the aircraft at the plane-maker's Seattle base on 25 September. He told a press conference that the carrier had "already sold" the capacity on the first two planes. A second 747-F is due to join the Qatar fleet in November. He told the press conference that Qatar Airways was currently experiencing a cargo boom following the blockade imposed by neighbouring countries over the country's alleged support for Middle East terrorist groups. Tonnage was currently up 160% compared with the same time last year, said Al Bakar. He was also confident that the carrier would continue to find a use for additional freighter capacity at such time as the blockade ended, for example by serving additional markets or moving cargo from bellyhold to freighter aircraft. At the conference, he also confirmed an order for an additional four 777-300 passenger aircraft, bringing the carrier's total order book with Boeing to $2.2bn.</p>

      <p>Maersk has responded to a call by forwarders toÂ share efforts toÂ standardiseÂ digitisationÂ through itsÂ TradeLensÂ platform, saying it is "cultivating diverse membership" and welcomes all-comers.</p>
      <p>This month, former DSV executive Steve WalkerÂ warned thatÂ the forwarding industry was at risk of losing out as shipping lines look to take control of data.</p>
      <p>"Maersk announced it wants half its earnings to come from inland logistics; a bold statement without reassuring words for their customer base of forwarders," wroteÂ MrÂ Walker.</p>
      <p>"IÂ feelÂ that the container shipping lines' threat of removing the forwarder and gaining greater direct FCL market share, is in fact growing.</p>
      <p>"And the threat is not about vessels, containers, rates, rebates or landside equipment, it is now driven by the one thing forwardersÂ mustÂ keep control of â€“ data."</p>
      <p>Pointing to Maersk'sÂ TradeLensÂ blockchain initiative, he added: "Here is a concerted effort, with multiple linesÂ under the Maersk/IBM joint venture banner, offering a secure controlled end-to-end solution where documents are no longer exchanged physically or digitally, but instead, the relevant data is shared and distributed using blockchain technology under single ownership principles determined by the type of information.</p>
      <p>"These veryÂ lines, who have been unable to give us any data, by phone or online are capable of leaping decades to seek control of a potential industry standard data flow mechanism."</p>
      <p>He asked ifÂ MaerskÂ wouldÂ allowÂ FiataÂ to sit on an independent management board,Â "now that the carriers want to become one of us", adding:Â "ThereforeÂ all data would reside under the control of an independent entity."</p>
      <p>Maersk issued a statement toÂ The Loadstar in response, which, while not directly addressing that point, said it welcomed forwarders on to its platform.</p>
      <p>"We are committed to embracing international standards and working with the bodies and organisations that help to driveÂ digitisationÂ broadly, such as the Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA) and the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT).</p>
      <p>"We are also committed to cultivating diverse membership on theÂ TradeLensÂ advisory board to ensureÂ TradeLensÂ works for all.</p>
      <p>"TradeLensÂ is an open and neutral platform which brings togetherÂ hundreds, and ultimatelyÂ thousands, of separate trading partners with the common approach to sharing information and documents securely and quickly, as well as to connect and simplify customers' supply chains.</p>
      <p>"Freight forwarders have always been forerunners when it comes to adapting new technologies that drive innovation and increase efficiency. They provide valuable services, andÂ TradeLensÂ helps to facilitate these activities in the global shipping network. Freight forwarders and 3PL providers, like Agility, Livingston, WWA and Kerry Logistics, are alreadyÂ working with the platform."</p>
      <p>However, there are industry concerns that TradeLens could fall foul of antitrust authorities, and may need to work harder at member diversification and openness.</p>
      <p>JOC noted last week that with five of the six biggest lines on board, "eventually, it's likely that antitrust authorities will view these sorts of private blockchain consortia as no different from the cartels they are currently cracking down on".</p>
      <p>Private platforms such as TradeLens could be "viewed as providing advantageous trading access. This could run the risk of being seen to unfairly exclude competitors", according to one law firm.</p>
      <p>Eight forwarders or groups have now joined TradeLens, along with some 18 shipping lines, 28 ports and terminals, and 10 inland transport companies.</p>
      <p>MrÂ Walker also suggested that another potential way forward would be forÂ FiataÂ to become involved with Kuehne + Nagel's Accenture platform.</p>
      <p>"I hear instantly the negative response," he wrote,Â "but if theÂ lines can collaborate, in this fast-changing world, could we the forwarding community at least consider this? We do not have time to lose; we need a partner on this journey already."</p>
      <p>However, a K+N spokesperson toldÂ The Loadstar: "KuehneÂ + Nagel does not wish to comment."</p>
      <p>FiataÂ toldÂ The LoadstarÂ last weekÂ it was broadly in agreement withÂ MrÂ Walker and would meet him next month to discuss a way forward.</p>
