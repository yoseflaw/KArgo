      <p>Ethiopian Airlines is improving the quality of its climate-controlled services through the use of DoKaSch Temperature Solutions' Opticooler container.</p>
      <p>The Opticooler is equipped with battery powered cooling compressors and heaters as well as a self regulating temperature control, so that temperature sensitive goods, in particular pharmaceuticals such as insulin and vaccines, stay within range at any point in the storage area.</p>
      <p>The airline has also signed a master agreement with the German ULD provider and has also opened the largest cargo terminal in Africa at its hub in Addis Ababa.</p>
      <p>The Addis Ababa hub focuses on handling temperature sensitive goods, and since February, Ethiopian Airlines has offered the DoKaSch active container to fly goods through the hub.</p>
      <p>Ethiopian Cargo &amp; Logistics Services managing director, Fitsum Abady says: "We are very glad to offer our customers a highly reliable packaging solution to transport temperature-sensitive shipments with DoKaSch's Opticooler.</p>
      <p>"In this fast growing and strongly competitive market, it is important that we offer our customers the best packaging solution for their sensitive cargo."</p>
      <p>DoKaSch Temperature Solutions managing director, Andreas Seitz says: "Ethiopian Airlines is the most successful African carrier and their hub in Addis Ababa develops very positive regarding the cargo handlings. Therefore, we are very pleased, that we could expand our African network by signing the master agreement with Ethiopian Airlines."</p>

      <p>Brussels Airlines Cargo has switched its GSSA from European Cargo Services (ECS) to Air Logistics Group for belly-hold space on its passenger services. The carrier said the decision to break with its representative of 13 years was part of "an ambitious strategic plan to further grow its cargo business." It said it marked "a new era in which Brussels Airlines wishes to get even closer to the customer" in its freight activities. Cargo has become an increasingly important activity for the Belgian carrier, with over 41,000 tonnes transported on its routes, which major on Africa but also include the US and the rest of Europe. Freight volumes have grown by double digits over the last five – and by 34% on North Atlantic routes and 8% in revenue terms on African routes. Brussels Airlines vice president sales Africa and cargo, Philippe Saeys-Desmedt explained: "Brussels Airlines Cargo is more than ever a strategic revenue contributor of our business and we foresee a further growth of our tonnage by 6 percent in 2016." ALG will represent Brussels Airlines Cargo worldwide from September 1 except for Africa, where the carrier will continue to represent itself. The carrier already offers a 'Fresh-to-shelf' service for perishable goods from Africa and to launch new products to serve other market segments in the next few months. Saeys-Desmedt added: "This cooperation will allow us to continue to raise Brussels Airlines Cargo's unique cargo brand to our customers, thanks to a dedicated sales team in Brussels and a vast worldwide network of agencies." ALG's chief operating officer Stephen Dawkins said: "Together we are very complementary, as we have extensive experience in the Asian and US markets, while Brussels Airlines is the Africa expert, with their unique and comprehensive network of destinations on the continent. "We will work together very closely to meet their customer's high expectations, so as Brussels Airlines Cargo can build an even stronger market position."</p>

      <p>Qatar Airways Group chief executive Akbar Al Baker hinted that his airline could place orders for further 747-8 freighter aircraft from Boeing, at a handover for the first of the aircraft at the plane-maker's Seattle base on 25 September. He told a press conference that the carrier had "already sold" the capacity on the first two planes. A second 747-F is due to join the Qatar fleet in November. He told the press conference that Qatar Airways was currently experiencing a cargo boom following the blockade imposed by neighbouring countries over the country's alleged support for Middle East terrorist groups. Tonnage was currently up 160% compared with the same time last year, said Al Bakar. He was also confident that the carrier would continue to find a use for additional freighter capacity at such time as the blockade ended, for example by serving additional markets or moving cargo from bellyhold to freighter aircraft. At the conference, he also confirmed an order for an additional four 777-300 passenger aircraft, bringing the carrier's total order book with Boeing to $2.2bn.</p>

      <p>The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) will work closely with AMACARGA to expand its presence in Latin America and support the air cargo community in the region.</p>
      <p>As part of the partnership, the two organisations will cooperate on their signature events including TIACA's Air Cargo Forums 2018 and 2020, as well as explore joint training and network initiatives.</p>
      <p>AMACARGA, the Mexican Association of Freight Forwarders will send a delegation to the 2018 ACF this October in Toronto, Canada to promote trade links and the airfreight industry in Mexico, whilst also looking to have a key presence at the 2020 event in Miami.</p>
      <p>TIACA secretary general, Vladimir Zubkov says: "Mexico is a very important country which has seen rapid economic growth in recent years, and we are keen to forge closer links with the region to help promote and represent its expanding air cargo community.</p>
      <p>"We believe closer collaboration will help exporters and importers in the region find new markets and will encourage the development of new airfreight links both within Latin America and between the rest of the world."</p>
      <p>The association is keen to build its presence in Latin America as part of its increased focus on areas that are outside the major airfreight markets, aiming to support growth and unify global standards throughout the world.</p>
      <p>AMACARGA president, Gaby Altuzar says: "Technological advances and new developments such as logistics 4.0 have encouraged AMACARGA to seek out strategic alliances, to find new ways of improving our industry as well as training the next generation, to help us meet the challenges that these emerging trends set – which is why we established our partnership with TIACA."</p>

      <p>Ethiopian Airlines has ordered an additional 10 Airbus A350-900s to enable further development of its long-haul network.</p>
      <p>The airline took delivery of its first A350 in June 2016, making it the first African operator of this aircraft, and Ethiopian now has four A350s, two of which are on lease.</p>
      <p>Ethiopian Airlines Group chief executive officer, Tewolde GebreMariam says: "The performance, operational and cost efficiencies we have achieved with our initial A350-900s have resulted in these additional ten aircraft order placement and thereby suffice our ever-expanding global network."</p>
      <p>"We will deploy the additional aircraft on our long haul routes connecting Addis Ababa with destinations in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia."</p>
      <p>Airbus Commercial Aircraft chief operating officer customers, John Leahy adds: "Ethiopian Airlines' repeat order is a resounding endorsement of the A350, its suitability, flexibility and unmatched economics. We are delighted that innovative aircraft as the A350 are closely associated with the world's fastest growing and profitable carriers."</p>
      <p>The A350 features the latest aerodynamic design and materials including carbon-fibre fuselage and wings, and is powered by fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, all of which improves efficiency with a 25 per cent reduction in fuel burn and emissions in addition to lower maintenance costs.</p>

      <p>Aeronautical Engineers (AEI) has chosen KF Aerospace as an Authorized Conversion Center to provide additional capacity for passenger-to-freighter conversions.</p>
      <p>KF Aerospace has major facilities in Kelowna, British Columbia and Hamilton, Ontario, and will start converting Boeing 737-400s from April this year.</p>
      <p>AEI says the success of its 737-400SF, MD80SF, CRJ200SF and soon the 737-800SF when certified this year, required additional conversion capacity to handle demand.</p>
      <p>It has three conversion centres including Commercial Jet in Miami, Florida, Commercial Jet Services in Dothan, Alabama and Boeing Shanghai Aviation Services in Shanghai, China, offering 11 to 13 conversion lines at any one time.</p>

      <p>PEMCO World Air Services has redelivered its second 737-300F to Europe Airpost (EAP). This latest quick change (QC) to full freighter modification was completed under a two aircraft agreement with an option for a third. All modifications were accomplished at PEMCO's Tampa facility. Said PEMCO: "While PEMCO's original contract with EAP consisted of the conversion of B737-300 aircraft from passenger to QC, EAP's requirements changed and PEMCO responded accordingly. The first two -300 QC to full freighter modifications were completed during the fourth quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015."</p>

      <p>After less than one month on the market, ACL Airshop's real-time Bluetooth-enabled ULD tracking technology is already translating into more cargo business, as carriers take steps to eliminate so-called "black spots" from the airfreight supply chain.</p>
      <p>"Improved ULD logistics has become one of our strategic focuses, as it directly contributes to the bottom line, while substantiating the growth of the top line," said Emile Khasanshin, vice president of global operations for Silk Way West Airlines, which confirmed a multi-year ULD management agreement with ACL Airshop.</p>
      <p>Khasanshin also said that ACL Airshop's technology fit into the carrier's "substantial expansion plans," adding that the new Bluetooth technology "will be a game-changer for us both, and for our end-customers."</p>
      <p>The Silk Way deal builds on ACL Airshop's announcement last month of a strategic alliance with CORE Transport Technologies, and the introduction of real-time Bluetooth tracking on its ULDs. ACL Airshop is now installing CORES's low-energy Bluetooth devices into the company's ULDs, which report ULD locations within airports and around the globe.</p>
      <p>Air freight nets at ACL Airshop's South Carolina facility</p>
      <p>After decades of being relegated to the fringes of air freight, ULDs are now being recognized as an important unit for tracking and measurement, ACL said, prompting renewed interest in technology that can track individual units and compile that into system level data on efficiency and movement.</p>
      <p>This alliance extends 10 years of ACL Airshop's service partnership with other airline units of Silk Way Holding.</p>

      <p>Aéroports de Paris and Sodexi have opened a 7,600 sq m express freight warehouse at Paris-Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport. The warehouse, with a €22m investment, will be used to manage and process flows of air freight and mail for express specialist Sodexi, which is 65 per cent  owned by Air France-KLM and 35 per cent by Geopost. Construction of the logistics building was completed in autumn 2014, following the signing of a long-term building lease in October 2012. The new facility can process up to 55,000 tonnes per year from over 160,000 commercial flights at CDG. Jérôme Balbi, managing director of Sodexi, said: "With the new express hub, located right next to the passenger terminals, Sodexi has acquired a modern, high- performance facility, ideal for processing flows of international express freight, particularly e-commerce-related. "Located just a few minutes from the aircraft parking stands, we will be able to offer our customers extremely rapid transit times between two commercial flights, just like passengers making a connection at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. "A parcel collected at the end of the previous afternoon in Hong Kong will arrive in Paris early in the morning, and can be connected straight away to a flight to southern Europe or Scandinavia, for example, with delivery in the early afternoon."

    <title>Finnair aims at doubling cargo</title>

      <p>Finnair Cargo is aiming to double the amount of cargo it handles by 2020, as part of its investment in its widebody fleet and construction of a new freight terminal.</p>
      <p>The carrier is set to receive 19 Airbus A350 over the next five years, increasing total bellyhold capacity by 50 per cent. In 2014, the airline handled 149,000 tonnes of cargo and is aiming to process 300,000 tonnes by 2020. Cargo made up 17 per cent of Finnair's revenues last year.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Air Cargo Week (ACW) on Tuesday 30 June before the cornerstone ceremony of the new terminal, Finnair Cargo vice president and head of cargo, Antti Kuusenmaki, says the facility heralds a new era for cargo and is part of a bigger plan and investment by Finnair, totalling three billion euros.</p>
      <p>Kuusenmaki explains Finnair's cargo strategy: "The construction is based on our model of transit cargo and specialised cargo. We have a strategy focusing on life sciences (pharma), perishables, mainly seafood and general cargo." Finnair has introduced eight services for specialist types of cargo including pharma and seafood and will have two more by the end of 2015, Kuusenmaki adds, as part of its bellyhold cargo strategy.</p>
      <p>The key trading lines for Finnair are central Europe and Asia, according to Kuusenmaki, and he says the airline is focusing on driving growth in these regions. The carrier is also set to add more bellyhold routes into high demand regions. "We are strong into North East Asia, China and Japan, as we have the optimum flying time from Europe of nine hours, so we want to get the most from this region," Kuusenmaki tells ACW.</p>
      <p>Kuusenmaki says a high growth area is salmon to Asia, and the carrier's proximity to Norway means they can move salmon to Japan within 36 hours. Finnair is also seeing demand for high-end products to China. The Scandinavian market has not been too well, Kuusenmaki says, and he adds that Helsinki is not the strongest market and has challenges along with nearby Sweden. He says the uncertain macro economic situations in the Eurozone and Russia have not had too much of a negative effect, as strengthening currencies in Asia have helped balance any impact out.</p>
      <p>Another key part of Finnair's strategy, Kuusenmaki explains, is the twice-weekly freighter service into Brussels Airport, its only freighter route. He says this is integral to growth as it feeds the carrier's network in Europe.</p>

      <p>Who'd have thought a product called "Amazing Liquid Fire" could be dangerous air cargo? Apparently, not Amazon.</p>
      <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) didn't think carrying the product, sold as a drain cleaner, was such a hot idea and is looking to slap Amazon with a US$350,000 fine for allegedly shipping prohibited and dangerous goods by air. The proposed fine stems from a 2014 spill of the caustic product, which sent nine UPS employees to the chemical wash after they felt a burning sensation.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time that shippers have been burned for moving prohibited cargo. In 2015, the FAA levied more than $4.5 million in penalties for improper shipments of hazardous air cargo, an increase from $3.4 million in 2014, according to the Dallas Morning News.</p>
      <p>Amazon is feeling the heat, and working with the FAA on the issue, the Seattle-based online retailer said in an e-mailed statement. "We ship tens of millions of products every day and have developed sophisticated technologies to detect potential shipping hazards and use any defects as an opportunity for continuous improvement," the company said. And with an estimated 3.3 million packages a day, 24 documented violations per year jives with the company's defense.</p>

      <p>Kenyan cargo handler Siginon Aviation has renewed its ground handling agreement with Singapore Airlines Cargo (SIA Cargo) at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi for three years.</p>
      <p>The new agreement follows a rigorous audit of Siginon's processes, facilities and systems in the newly opened air cargo terminal on the airside of JKIA.</p>
      <p>Siginon Aviation has handled SIA Cargo at JKIA for over a decade, a relationship that has been renewed repeatedly due to the handlers achievement of high service standards in ground handling.</p>

      <p>"The renewal of the ground handling agreement by Singapore Airlines reaffirms our commitment to ensure customer satisfaction and business growth."</p>
      <p>Siginon Aviation launched operations in its state of the art air cargo terminal in 2014 as well as acquired a series of global certifications such as; IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operators (ISAGO), RA3 and local certifications such as regulated agent by the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA).</p>
      <p>Siginon Aviation was incepted in 1997 and also runs a similar operation in Eldoret International Airport.</p>

      <p>Solar Impulse 2 completed its historic solar-powered flight around the globe with the logistics support of Chapman Freeborn and Volga-Dnepr Airlines.</p>
      <p>Chapman Freeborn and Volga-Dnepr provided logistical assistance with the provision of both cargo and passenger chartered aircraft to transport spare parts, a mobile hangar and the technical team to support the record-breaking round-the-world trip. Other support included a Volga-Dnepr IL-76TD-90VD and an ATR-72 support aircraft and Chapman Freeborn's Wing 24 flight support team to help manage project operations including flight permits and customs clearance, ground handling and immigration arrangements.</p>
      <p>Chapman Freeborn cargo business development director, Pierre van der Stichele says: "The project required all of our global charter market expertise as we were working around Si2's changeable flight schedules – with support solutions required in Asia, North America, Europe, and North Africa."</p>
      <p>"We would also like to thank Volga-Dnepr for its professionalism for assisting in ensuring the cargo always reached its destination safely and on time."</p>
      <p>Volga-Dnepr Airlines regional sales manager, Georgy Sokolov says: "Volga-Dnepr Group is strongly committed to improving the environmental efficiency of its fleet and to embracing all levels of aviation innovation so it was a special pleasure for us to play a long-term role in the historic achievement of the Solar Impulse 2 team."</p>
      <p>Solar Impulse is the first aircraft to fly day and night without fuel or polluting emissions and was piloted around the world in stages by Swiss pioneers, Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg. The journey started in March 2015 from Abu Dhabi and returned on 26 July 2016 after a 17-leg journey covering 43,041 kilometres, completing 23 days of flight.</p>

      <p>Boeing won a major freighter order from Turkish Airlines for three 777 Freighters as the flag carrier of Turkey continues to soar on record financial results and double-digit passenger and cargo growth.</p>
      <p>Based on the 777-200LR (Longer Range), the 777 Freighter can fly 4,900 nautical miles (9,070 kilometers) with a full payload of 112 tons (102 metric tonnes or 102,000 kg). The long range means fewer stops and associated landing fees, less congestion at transfer hubs, lower cargo handling costs and shorter delivery times.</p>
      <p>"The additional aircraft will provide us more flexibility to serve even more destinations as we continue to grow our global freight network," said M. Ilker Ayc?, Turkish Airlines chairman of the Board and the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p>The new order comes days after Turkish Airlines posted record profits for the first nine months of 2018 on strong passenger and cargo demand. The carrier's air freight business saw a 25-percent tonnage increase and a 29-percent revenue increase compared to the same period a year ago. The results extend the airline's success in recent years as Turkey has become one of the largest and fastest-growing aviation markets.</p>
      <p>In line with the rapid growth, Turkish Airlines has steadily expanded its current and future fleet. Last January, the carrier announced the order of three 777 Freighters. Two months later, Turkish finalized an order for 25 787-9 Dreamliners and five options to prepare for growing demand at Istanbul's third airport, named "Istanbul Airport" by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an during its official opening last month. Over the past few months, Turkish has begun taking delivery of new 737 MAX airplanes to refresh its single-aisle jets. In all, the airline's fleet of Boeing jetliners has grown to more than 160, with nearly 100 additional jets on order.</p>
      <p>With more than 30 777s in its fleet, Turkish Airlines is among the top 10 operators of the wide-body jet in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, Boeing has launched a strategic partnership programme in Turkey last year, called the National Aerospace Initiative. Aligned with the targets of Turkey's Vision 2023 that set for the 100th anniversary of Turkish Republic's foundation, the initiative lays out a strategic collaboration framework in four key areas: industrial development, technology acceleration, services collaboration and advanced-skill training.</p>
      <p>In line with these goals, Boeing is planning to open an engineering center in Istanbul that would specialize in research and support Turkey's growing aerospace capability. The company also recently expanded its collaboration with Turkish Technic, the maintenance arm of Turkish Airlines. Under the agreement, Turkish Technic becomes a strategic supplier for Boeing's Global Fleet Care programme, providing operators with line maintenance, heavy maintenance, component service and repair for multiple aircraft models. Additionally, Boeing and Turkish Technic will partner to train and certify aircraft technicians.</p>

      <p>US carrier American Airlines Cargo will utilize ULD management provider Jettainer's "Cool Management" service. The service includes the leasing, managing and positioning as well as process-related monitoring of temperature-controlled ULDs.</p>
      <p>The airline now has access to the 24/7 service of Jettainer's own Cool Center of Excellence in Abu Dhabi, which is specifically responsible for managing temperature-controlled ULDs.</p>
      <p>After a successful test run, Jettainer's Cool Center of Excellence in Abu Dhabi has been managing the entire fleet of American Airlines Cargo reefer containers.</p>
      <p>With this service, Jettainer minimises the risk involved in the transportation process of temperature-sensitive air freight, especially the complex interaction between shipper, forwarder and airline, and to some extent the owner of the containers.</p>
      <p>In addition, the service reduces costs that can arise, for example, due to positioning or overcapacity.</p>

    <title>Bimco brings new proposal to shipping emissions debate</title>

    <content>
      <p>Shipping association Bimco has submitted a new proposal on regulating ships' power to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) working group.</p>
      <p>The move is a bid to stimulate debate on reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from shipping .</p>
      <p>The proposal to improve the operational energy efficiency of vessels will be introduced at the next IMO intersessional meeting on reducing GHG emissions from ships, in London this month.</p>
      <p>A French-led delegation to the IMO has this year called for mandatory slow-steaming as the most effective way to reduce emissions, and at the G7 summit in Biarritz in August, President Macron reaffirmed France's commitment to slow-steaming.</p>
      <p>However, shipowner associations have been critical of slow-steaming lobbyists, claiming a mandatory speed reduction in shipping could have "unwanted consequences".</p>
      <p>Policy director of the UK Chamber of Shipping Anna Ziou said speed limits as the tool for cutting vessels emissions would give a "false impression" of the industry acting.</p>
      <p>"To achieve a 50% cut in emissions, the shipping industry needs continued investment in green technologies," she argued, suggesting instead that the future for lay in a range of low-carbon propulsion, such as battery power and hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
      <p>And in a guest post in The Loadstar last week, senior analyst at Maritime Strategies International Dan Richards argued that liner companies faced a "trade-off" between minimising fuel bills, thus cutting emissions, but no longer being able to offer a full network of port pairs.</p>
      <p>"Put another way, a liner company could reduce its fuel bill only to find its market share eroded by a different carrier offering more varied and faster transits," he wrote.</p>
      <p>In a discussion document, Bimco agrees that a ship's speed is the "single most important variable influencing its CO2 emissions" and that short-term measures reflecting this should be "pursued as a priority".</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it says the capping of a ship's speed is "not easily assessed", and that environmental conditions such as sea currents, sea state and weather "impact heavily on the relation between speed over ground and speed through water".</p>
      <p>Instead, aiming a regulatory measure at the wide range of options related to a ship's efficiency "would be desirable".</p>
      <p>"Measuring a ship's speed is not an accurate exercise, therefore other avenues have been investigated. It has been concluded that limiting ships' propulsion power can be controlled accurately and, at the same time, it has a close correlation to speed," said Bimco.</p>
      <p>Noting that setting a limit for ships' power has already been suggested by Japan, Bimco recommends in its proposal that the power unit should be derived from "an assumed performance of an average ship sailing at current average trading speed within each sector".</p>
      <p>So far The Loadstar has failed to find a single carrier source in favour of a mandatory speed limit on containerships, with several commenting that power flexibility was essential for safety and operational reasons.</p>
      <p>One executive told The Loadstar the company already had a very strict system to maximise the efficiency of its fleet.</p>
      <p>"It is in our interests to save money and, of course, to cut emissions," he said. "Our captains have to go through many hoops before they can increase the speed of their ships, but we don't want to take that option away from them completely."</p>

      <p>LUG air cargo handling has modernised and expanded its Health Care Center (HCC) at Frankfurt Airport in a 650 sq m first step programme that paves the way for possible expansion to 1,200 sq m. The company has also recruited Dominik Misskampf as senior project manager to handle the expansion project. The HCC, said a LUG spokesperson, has an "all-embracing temperature monitoring and recording as well as an alarm system guarantee clients a transparent, qualified air cargo supply chain for pharmaceutical products". LUG is currently going through the IATA CEIV Pharma certification programme, a process that is due to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Patrik Tschirch, chief executive of LUG, said: "We are undertaking considerable investments in the area of temperature sensitive cargo handling with the expansion and modernization of the HCC. "We are thus adapting our facilities to our new client structure. From October, we have Emirates SkyCargo in our customer portfolio, an airline with a relatively high share of life science and healthcare shipments ex Frankfurt/Main." As part of that expansion, Misskampf will "look after the enhancement of processes and their adaptation to the new infrastructure as well as the IATA certification," said the spokesperson. Previously Misskampf was responsible for supply chain optimisation projects at Ground Handling Services Fraport. He is also head of the competence team pharma of the Air Cargo Community Frankfurt. The aim of the platform is the optimization of processes across companies and supply chains in order to enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of Frankfurt as a cargo hub. Said Misskampf: "The project is an important step to increase the performance of the company and to safeguard and strengthen its competitiveness." Tschirch added: "We do not only meet the rising demands of our clients but also underline our own claim to quality leadership with the new infrastructure and the independent certification by IATA."

      <p>THE bellyhold of a China Southern passenger A321 caught fire on Monday 13 September, the second fire for the airline in 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The cargo hold caught fire after passengers and cargo had been loaded and before taxiing for take off at Gungzhou Baiyun International Airport.</p>
      <p>The cause has so far been limited only to "combustibles" in the hold. No further information is currently available.</p>
      <p>While not necessarily cause for alarm it does nothing to ease worries about China's aviation industry, following, as it does, immediately after a China Southern tyre fire the day before, the Hainan Airlines crash that killed 42 and an investigation that revealed 200 pilots who forged their employment history papers.</p>

      <p>The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) will allow a consortium of ro-ro shipping lines to jointly negotiate the procurement of tug services at US ports, but the decision was not unanimous.</p>
      <p>Last week, the FMC voted four-to-one in favour of allowing an amendment to the service agreement between international car carriers Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics (WWL), Eukor, American Roll-on Roll-off Carrier (ARC) and Hyundai Glovis.</p>
      <p>FMC chairman Mario Cordero said: "Careful analysis of what was proposed yielded no concerns about potential anticompetitive behaviour, or adverse consequences to ports or the American shipper.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately, this amendment should increase efficiencies, benefiting our nation's port gateways."</p>
      <p>However, commissioner William Doyle voted to reject the amendment, claiming that allowing foreign carriers to negotiate collectively for US-flagged tug services went "beyond the scope of the Shipping Act".</p>
      <p>Mr Doyle added that the maritime business community had raised objections and that "tens of thousands of family wage jobs are supported by these services".</p>
      <p>Mr Doyle quoted from the American Waterways Operators' objection to the amendment which suggested: "Such a provision would allow ocean carriers to gain an advantaged bargaining position."</p>
      <p>He argued the FMC concession "tilts the playing field" and "opens the door to anti-competitive behaviour".</p>
      <p>The amendment could set a precedent which could spark a similar move by container carriers.</p>
      <p>The THE Alliance agreement (filed with and approved by the FMC and can be accessed here) between container carriers Hapag-Lloyd, K Line, MOL, NYK and Yang Ming states in Article 5.2 (l) that the parties are allowed to jointly contract with tug operators "provided they are procured outside the United States".</p>
      <p>Mr Doyle was directly involved with the THE Alliance agreement discussions and enthused that the grouping was the first to provide safeguards in case of a failure of one of its members, responding to the concerns of shippers in the wake of the Hanjin bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>The wording in Section 7.4 of THE Alliance agreement authorises the remaining (non-bankrupt) parties to "make financial or operational arrangements directly with shippers, providers of vessel space to the affected Line … agents service providers and sub-contractors … and other measures necessary to maintain continuity of operations and to minimise disruption or congestion."</p>
      <p>Mr Doyle said that the intent of the "framework language" in THE Alliance agreement was to avoid a repeat of the significant disruption to the supply chain caused by the sudden crash of Hanjin Shipping in August last year.</p>
      <p>He added that the members of the Ocean Alliance are "in the process of reviewing their safeguard offerings post-Hanjin", and noted that the 2M had "recently announced that it had safeguards in place for its strategic operation agreement with HMM".</p>

      <p>Canada is edging closer to a revised air cargo security process that will allow shippers to screen outbound airfreight consignments prior to arrival at an airport. Department officials at Transport Canada estimate that the amendments would result in a net benefit of C$202m over 10 years. "Shippers need to be given the authority to screen their own goods," said Transport Canada, adding: "In order to do so, there must be a regulatory framework in place to establish, maintain and enforce a security program that international partners will recognize." The fresh proposals by the federal government in Ottawa aim to replace the current registered shipper process with "a more robust known-consignor program, in order to address security gaps in the secure supply chain," said Transport Canada. The country's current Air Cargo Security Program does not allow shippers to screen and secure their own goods intended to go by air. The proposed amendments would allow consignors or originators of the freight to become known-consignors and to screen and tender their own goods as secure cargo, either to members of the existing Air Cargo Security Program or directly to air carriers. Transport Canada says that goods worth C$100bn are processed every year at Canadian airports, with more than 400 tonnes of cargo moved on passenger aircraft. Eighty per cent of all air cargo departing Canadian airports is destined for non–US international destinations.

    <content>
      <p>Maersk has responded to a call by forwarders to share efforts to standardise digitisation through its TradeLens platform, saying it is "cultivating diverse membership" and welcomes all-comers.</p>
      <p>This month, former DSV executive Steve Walker warned that the forwarding industry was at risk of losing out as shipping lines look to take control of data.</p>
      <p>"Maersk announced it wants half its earnings to come from inland logistics; a bold statement without reassuring words for their customer base of forwarders," wrote Mr Walker.</p>
      <p>"I feel that the container shipping lines' threat of removing the forwarder and gaining greater direct FCL market share, is in fact growing.</p>
      <p>"And the threat is not about vessels, containers, rates, rebates or landside equipment, it is now driven by the one thing forwarders must keep control of – data."</p>
      <p>Pointing to Maersk's TradeLens blockchain initiative, he added: "Here is a concerted effort, with multiple lines under the Maersk/IBM joint venture banner, offering a secure controlled end-to-end solution where documents are no longer exchanged physically or digitally, but instead, the relevant data is shared and distributed using blockchain technology under single ownership principles determined by the type of information.</p>
      <p>"These very lines, who have been unable to give us any data, by phone or online are capable of leaping decades to seek control of a potential industry standard data flow mechanism."</p>
      <p>He asked if Maersk would allow Fiata to sit on an independent management board, "now that the carriers want to become one of us", adding: "Therefore all data would reside under the control of an independent entity."</p>
      <p>Maersk issued a statement to The Loadstar in response, which, while not directly addressing that point, said it welcomed forwarders on to its platform.</p>
      <p>"We are committed to embracing international standards and working with the bodies and organisations that help to drive digitisation broadly, such as the Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA) and the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT).</p>
      <p>"We are also committed to cultivating diverse membership on the TradeLens advisory board to ensure TradeLens works for all.</p>
      <p>"TradeLens is an open and neutral platform which brings together hundreds, and ultimately thousands, of separate trading partners with the common approach to sharing information and documents securely and quickly, as well as to connect and simplify customers' supply chains.</p>
      <p>"Freight forwarders have always been forerunners when it comes to adapting new technologies that drive innovation and increase efficiency. They provide valuable services, and TradeLens helps to facilitate these activities in the global shipping network. Freight forwarders and 3PL providers, like Agility, Livingston, WWA and Kerry Logistics, are already working with the platform."</p>
      <p>However, there are industry concerns that TradeLens could fall foul of antitrust authorities, and may need to work harder at member diversification and openness.</p>
      <p>JOC noted last week that with five of the six biggest lines on board, "eventually, it's likely that antitrust authorities will view these sorts of private blockchain consortia as no different from the cartels they are currently cracking down on".</p>
      <p>Private platforms such as TradeLens could be "viewed as providing advantageous trading access. This could run the risk of being seen to unfairly exclude competitors", according to one law firm.</p>
      <p>Eight forwarders or groups have now joined TradeLens, along with some 18 shipping lines, 28 ports and terminals, and 10 inland transport companies.</p>
      <p>Mr Walker also suggested that another potential way forward would be for Fiata to become involved with Kuehne + Nagel's Accenture platform.</p>
      <p>"I hear instantly the negative response," he wrote, "but if the lines can collaborate, in this fast-changing world, could we the forwarding community at least consider this? We do not have time to lose; we need a partner on this journey already."</p>
      <p>However, a K+N spokesperson told The Loadstar: "Kuehne + Nagel does not wish to comment."</p>
      <p>Fiata told The Loadstar last week it was broadly in agreement with Mr Walker and would meet him next month to discuss a way forward.</p>

      <p>American Airlines Cargo has picked G Force GSA Mexico as its general sales agent (GSA) for Mexico following the retirement of its current GSA.</p>
      <p>G Force will be responsible for selling American's services in Mexico City as of 1 July, as well as establishing a local sales presence in Cancun, Guadalajara, Leon, Puerto Vallarta and Monterrey.</p>
      <p>The GSA will provide local services throughout Mexico, bringing local expertise about American's entire product portfolio and vast global network as well as a higher level of customer service in these fast-growing markets.</p>
      <p>American Airlines Cargo GSA contract manager, Shanna Abbott says Mexico is very important for the airline's network with high demand for products including pharmaceuticals, auto parts and seafood.</p>
      <p>She says: "Having G Force represent us throughout Mexico will enhance service for our customers who ship to or from these key cities. A local presence is a sure-fire way for us to ensure that each customer's needs are being met."</p>
      <p>G Force station manager, Marcel Barjau says: "Our team has experience in cargo with a variety of airlines and logistics venues. We have a unique understanding of the needs of customers and of our local markets."</p>
      <p>"And we are very much looking forward to working with American Airlines Cargo, adding to the strength of their international cargo network and these growing areas."</p>

      <p>Embarking on a new phase of freight expansion, Taiwan's EVA Air is all set to put its new Boeing 777 freighter in service on routes between Asia and North America by the month end.EVA Air took delivery of its first Boeing 777 freighter recently and flew it from Paine Field to Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport (TPE). EVA plans to put its new Boeing 777 freighter in service on routes between Asia and North America in late November. Its freighter destinations in Asia include Shanghai Pudong, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Hong Kong, Osaka, Singapore, Bangkok, Penang and Hanoi. On the other hand, its air cargo gateways in North America are Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth and Atlanta. EVA currently offers airfreight services across 62 routes, including five dedicated cargo gateways, with 35 weekly freighter flights. Boeing 777 freighter is the world's largest twin-engine air cargo carrier. It was designed to replace the 747-400 and MD11 freighters. Based on the Boeing 777-200LR, the 777 freighter has the range to fly 5,000 nautical miles fully loaded with a maximum capacity of 103 tons.</p>

      <p>DHL Global Forwarding has launched a new online quote and booking platform for air and ocean shipments.</p>
      <p>The decision follows other operators already offering online booking, while Australia's Toll Group last month outsourced its online needs to Kontainers in a three-year deal.</p>
      <p>However, DHL GF has opted to develop its own service, DHLi Quote &amp; Book, which chief executive Tim Schwarth claimed would be the market's "most user-friendly" system.</p>
      <p>"With this new service, we continue our digital transformation with the clear aspiration to become the leading global logistics provider," he said. "During the development, we listened to our customers' needs and improved upon our prior online tool.</p>
      <p>"We added new features, increased coverage and implemented a highly intuitive user interface to achieve a simple and effective customer experience."</p>
      <p>The system allows for quotes and bookings to be made on a 24/7 basis, covering door-to-door shipments, and provides comparisons between the operator's services.</p>
      <p>It is currently available for use in more than 60 countries, and there are expectations it will be expanded.</p>
      <p>Toll's migration to online booking is expected later in the year, and a source told The Loadstar that two more forwarders were set to sign up to the Kontainers platform.</p>
      <p>Online booking is seen as one of the core tools for forwarders looking to land SME shippers.</p>
      <p>Toll Global Forwarding president Thomas Knudsen said: "The addition of Kontainers will allow clients instant quotes and to book shipments at the click of the mouse."</p>
      <p>The Loadstar's new IT and tech column, The Road Test, will examine DHL's new offering later this week. See here for the first in the series, on DSV's Lead Logistics offering.</p>

      <p>US-based custom ULD solutions provider ACL Airshop is participating in the ongoing annual ULD Care Conference in Montreal.</p>
      <p>The company is discussing continued progress with innovative technologies such as Bluetooth tracking &amp; tracing, "ULD Control" proprietary logistics programmes, and their latest "FindMyULD" free app, all in the context of the company's continued arrangement with Descartes through its acquisition of CORE Transport Technologies.</p>
      <p>Descartes is an Ontario headquartered Canadian and US publicly traded company with FY19 revenues of $275 Million (US).</p>
      <p>ACL Airshop launches new ULD fleet management app</p>
      <p>Jos Jacobsen, ACL Airshop's managing director-Global Leasing &amp; chief technology officer, who is also a Board member of ULD Care and attending in Montreal said: "Despite current tariff wars, long-term the air cargo sector is increasing in volume, value, and even as a percentage of total world trade shipments. Tracking ULDs and their contents in real-time not only can reduce costs, it helps answer shippers' questions about where their goods are, and their status along the supply chain. We are seeing new ways to add value for our customers with these initiatives."</p>
      <p>ACL, CORE to roll out Bluetooth-enabled logistics technology to track air cargo</p>
      <p>ACL Airshop and CORE Transport Technologies teamed up several years ago, announcing in September 2017 during the ULD Care Conference in Budapest their ambitious strategic alliance plans.</p>
      <p>Wes Tucker, ACL Airshop's executive VP for The Americas who helped ink that initial partnership said: "We are in actual implementation of Bluetooth, ULD Control, and FindMyULD with multiple airlines. Like most first adopters, we are continuously improving the service product as we go along. We will actually demonstrate FindMyULD for any airlines clients attending ULD Care who wish to check it out, it's intriguingly effective."</p>
      <p>He continued: "We believe the strength of Descartes as CORE's new globally-networked parent bodes well for continuing advancements."</p>
      <p>ACL Airshop is one of the corporate signatories to the ULD Care CODE OF CONDUCT.</p>
      <p>Pieter van Calcar, ACL Airshop's managing director-Asia Pacific, said: "It's always about quality, safety, and service with us, for our hundreds of airlines and air cargo clients. ULD are flight safety critical and costly items of aircraft equipment. The Code of Conduct creates a foundation for all players in the air cargo industry worldwide to deliver safe, sustainable, cost-effective ULD operations."</p>

      <p>AIRBRIDGECARGO Airlines (ABC) has added a fifth 747-400 freighter to its fleet.</p>
      <p>This brings the airline's total freighter fleet to eight, which includes two 747-200s and one 747-300.</p>
      <p>ABC had ordered five of the new 747-8 freighters, but Boeing's production delays have put delivery of those back to February next year.</p>
      <p>"The decision to take this extra aircraft represents our commitment to continue our development plans despite delays in the delivery of brand new Boeing 747-8," said Tatyana Arslanova, ABC's executive president.</p>
      <p>"By the end of 2009, we could clearly see that there are some markets in the world, such as Shanghai, that require increased aircraft capacity. With no Boeing 747-8 being delivered this year, the additional Boeing 747-400 will enable ABC to increase number of frequencies from Shanghai to 12 a week, thus providing our customers with more capacity as dictated by the market demand."</p>

      <p>AirBridgeCargo (ABC) Airlines has further enhanced pharma services by gaining Envirotainer QEP accreditation at its global hub at Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport and in Dallas.</p>
      <p>Envirotainer created its Qualified Envirotainer Provider Training and Quality Program (QEP) to recognise transport service providers which demonstrate their ability to properly manage Envirotainer container shipments in accordance with Good Distribution Practices.</p>
      <p>ABC global director of pharma, Fedor Novikov says: "We have been heavily involved in pharma transportation since 2016 and our focus over the last 18 months has been to invest in developing the products and services our customers need. QEP accreditation is one of the benchmarks we and our customers recognise as being very important as we grow pharma volumes across our network."</p>
      <p>The abcPharma product was developed in close consultation with customers by ABC's pharma industry vertical team, which includes qualified staff at all levels.</p>
      <p>This has led to ABC enforcing strict handling procedures and control processes required for pharma shipments during all stages of transportation.</p>
      <p>In November 2016 ABC became the first airline in Russia to receive IATA CEIV Pharma certification, which addresses the need for more safety, security, compliance and efficiency through a globally consistent pharma product handling certification programme.</p>
      <p>When developing its pharma product, ABC conducted lane assessments to understand each international station's readiness to handle pharma shipments, including strict audits of ground handling agents and ramp agents, as well as trucking companies and other outsourced partners.</p>
      <p>Envirotainer compliance manager, Chris Fore says: "As one of the world's fastest-growing all-cargo airlines and with a network serving major pharmaceutical markets and trade lanes in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, AirBridgeCargo clearly realises its responsibility to its customers in terms of delivering a quality product to the end user- a patient."</p>
      <p>"QEP accreditation sends a strong message about the high standards the airline is committed to delivering."</p>

      <p>Vienna Airport has added 13,000 square metres of cargo capacity and opened a new Pharma Handling Centre to meet growing air cargo volumes and demand.</p>
      <p>The developments are part of a €17.9 million investment by operator Flughafen Wien to expand its cargo capabilities and it says further facility expansion of air cargo and locating of logistics partners is a "crucial" future growth area.</p>
      <p>As part of the plan four steps are being taken: the expansion of the Air Cargo Centre, the new pharma hub, the locating of logistics centres such as Cargo Partner, DHL and other firms as well as the improvement and expansion of transport infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The airport opened a new logistics centre in October adding 13,000 square metres to the Air Cargo Centre including deployment of latest technology and the Pharma Handling Centre.</p>
      <p>In the future, the airport explains there will be a strong focuson the new Pharma Handling Centre, which covers about 1,600 square meters and is located in the enlarged Air Cargo Centre.</p>
      <p>The facility features a 153 square metre cold store for shipments from 2°-8°C, and another 1,415 square metre area for 15°-25°C. Vienna Airport will invest a further €1.9 million in the new Pharma Handling Centre up until the autumn of 2018.</p>
      <p>The gateway is also focusing on sustainable growth and one of the country's largest photovoltaic facilities covering an area of 8,000 square metres was installed on the roof of the state-of-the-art Air Cargo Centre.</p>
      <p>Flughafen Wien member of the management board, Julian Jäger says: "Our good market position as an air cargo transshipment hub will be further strengthened thanks to the expansion of the Air Cargo Centre.</p>
      <p>"In particular, we can focus on a market niche with high standards on the basis of the future Pharma Handling Centre and position ourselves through first-class expertise and an optimal infrastructure.</p>
      <p>"Austria is an exporting country in the pharmaceutical industry, which is developing very well. We will support domestic pharmaceutical companies to generate growth by providing special, highly professional handling services."</p>
      <p>Fellow member of the management board, Günther Ofner adds that half the export production value of lower Austrian industry, products manufactured to the amount of €8 billion is transported as cargo throughout the world via Vienna Airport underlines the gateway's "essential role" as a cargo transshipment hub.</p>
      <p>He adds: "Further growth is expected in the years to come, especially due to the strong increase in e-commerce. Our own investments, especially the locating of logistics partners at the airport site such as cargo-partner, Kühne+Nagel and soon DHL contribute to exploiting this growth potential.</p>
      <p>"DHL will set up a logistics centre on an area of over 60,000 square metres and create 500 new jobs."</p>

      <p>Alphaliner's analysis of Ocean Network Express's Day ONE service network from April 1 – outside THE Alliance – reveals only "minor changes" to the current offerings of Japanese carriers K Line, MOL and NYK.</p>
      <p>"The Africa and Oceania routes will see no changes, with all current 3J service coverage retained," said the consultant.</p>
      <p>It added that ONE's coverage of the Latin American trade would also be "largely retained", with the exception of a new service from Asia to Central America and the South American west coast.</p>
      <p>This is due to the restructuring on the tradelane caused by Maersk Line's acquisition of Hamburg Süd. ONE has announced three new weekly loops deploying 34 vessels of 6,000-13,000 teu.</p>
      <p>Alphaliner said the main changes in the new ONE network would be on its intra-Asia network, where overlaps would see "services being consolidated".</p>
      <p>The analyst expected the rationalisations to be limited to slot charters on third-party carriers and Alphaliner does not anticipate "any significant removal of existing 3J tonnage". This will be welcome news for shipowners expecting to see a number of ships returned after the three carriers merged.</p>
      <p>But with rivals ready to pounce on any weakness in the ONE debut network, the commercial teams in the new entity would appear to have won their first battle with the operations and vessel planners.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, in the mid-to-longer term, the operational synergies will be more closely aligned to the strategy of the ONE business plan to achieve a saving of $440m in the first fiscal year – ending 31 March 2019 – and thereafter $1bn a year.</p>
      <p>"During the period preceding the official commencement of ONE on 1 April, there will be up to four companies operating on the same service," said Alphaliner.</p>
      <p>ONE began accepting bookings on 1 February for vessel departures in April, and initial reports to The Loadstar from customers is that the transition is being handled with little disruption or confusion.</p>
      <p>The Loadstar understands that most of the key commercial contacts from K Line, MOL and NYK are being retained in ONE to offer customers continuity. This will be particularly important for the Japanese trading house behemoths that have supported the individual carriers for decades.</p>
      <p>It would appear that the cost savings required to meet the $1bn a year target will mostly come from operational and back office staff redundancies, along with a reduction in and consolidation of port agencies, commercial feeders and service provider fees and cuts to stevedoring rates.</p>

      <p>Egyptair Cargo has revealed plans to expand its freighter fleet as it targets the launch of new intercontinental services. The airline told Air Cargo News that it will take delivery of three Airbus A330-200 passenger-to-freighter conversions before the end of March 2019. The first of the freighters is due to join Egyptair Cargo's fleet in June, with the second due in October and the third in March 2019. There are also plans to take delivery of two Boeing 737-800 freighters, although these are part of future plans and not likely to arrive until 2020. The new 58 ton capacity Airbus freighters will operate services to the US and east Asia, with airports likely to include New York JFK, Guangzhou and Hong Kong via its central hubs Cologne-Bonn, Ostend East and other locations in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the 20-22 ton capacity Boeing freighters will be used on intra-African routes serving the local market. The airline also plans to add 15,000 sq m of ground handling warehousing to existing facilities at its Cairo base. The airline hopes that the new aircraft and expansion of warehousing facilities will help boost cargo volumes by around 30%. Meanwhile, the airline also revealed figures pointing to cargo growth on its Cologne services last year. Total volumes transported by Egyptair Cargo through the German airport increased by 36% last year to 13,171 tonnes. The improvements have continued this, with volumes increasing by 33% year-on-year in January and February combined. Egyptair's freighter fleet currently stands at four A300F aircraft. In 2012, it signed up to be the launch customer for EFW's A330-200P2F programme in 2012, with delivery of the first aircraft originally slated for the end of last year.

      <p>Kuhne+Nagel (K+N) is hoping to speed up the process of digitisation in the supply chain with the opening of new innovation centres. The Switzerland-based freight forwarder this week announced the opening of innovation centres in Utrecht, Netherlands, and Singapore. The Innovation Centre in Utrecht will primarily focus on automation and picking technologies. The Asia Pacific Innovation Centre in Singapore will research and deploy new solutions on connected warehouses, with a focus on data analytics and Internet of Things. Both centres hold partnerships with universities, start-ups and organisations to develop innovative supply chain solutions. K+N chief information officer Martin Kolbe said: "We are working on seamless data exchange of different systems to drive automation and to minimise manual efforts. "In addition we create new services and interfaces allowing customers to easily connect with K+N. "Applying Big Data and predictive analytics, supply chains can be managed more efficiently and effectively." K+N member of the managing board Gianfranco Sgro added: "The innovation centres in Singapore and Utrecht will boost our digital road map by exploring, applying and deploying leading technologies to manage our customers' supply chains even more efficiently and effectively. "The market for contract logistics services is transforming substantially due to the effects of digitalisation. "With the Innovation Centers we invest in research and new technologies to accelerate this transformation." During the inauguration ceremony in Singapore, the forwarder announced a strategic partnership with global software-industrial provider Honeywell to support its warehouse initiatives. Last week, the forwarder launched a new digital supply chain management platform. The forwarder's new end-to-end purchase order management service will allow customers to connect with their vendors, their buyers and sellers, Kuehne + Nagel's physical assets and experts, and their cargo flows.

      <p>Ground handler dnata has officially opened a 37,000 sq ft cargo centre that includes the only dedicated cool-chain perishable cargo facility at Dallas (DFW) airport. Dnata said the cargo handling centre, which started some operations last year ahead of full opening, is suitable for all perishable products and was developed as part of its agreement with AirLogistix USA, which it acquired last year Around 18,000 sq ft of the facility is dedicated to cool-chain solutions with staff trained to ensure that perishables such as pharmaceuticals, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and seafood, meat and flowers maintain their freshness during the entire air transportation process. Having recieved the IATA's CEIV accreditation, Japan Airlines was the first launch customer to experience the state-of-the-art facility from 1 November 2017, Dnata USA chief executive David Barker said: "We realised that it was not only important for us to build a modern cool-chain facility to meet our long term objectives, but to also go the extra mile and ensure the compliance of our operations against the highest international standards. "There is a clear need to increase capacity and ensure our customers have the flexibility that meets their specific needs via our cool-chain solutions." John Ackerman, executive vice president global strategy and development at DFW said: "Shippers in many trade lanes between Latin America and Asia with perishables like salmon, berries, and asparagus, can save as much as two days by using DFW over other airports. "DFW's strength lies in its airline network of passenger service with daily belly cargo capacity between Latin America and Asia combined with our excellent freighter services to Asia by nine Asian air freighter operators."

      <p>Delta Cargo is set to become the first bellyhold airline in the US to offer real-time ULD tracking with the introduction of Bluetooth tracking technology. The technology will replace manual tracking for all shipping containers and allow Delta's cargo control center to more accurately monitor and reroute shipments that are delayed due to irregular operations, like inclement weather. Delta vice president-cargo Shawn Cole said: "Our customers have told us they want improved tracking and immediate transparency for ULD shipments, and this best-in-class product will deliver exactly that. "Our innovative tracking technology, in conjunction with our 24/7 cargo control center, gives us the competitive edge when it comes to serving our customers." When implemented, the new tracking system will also enable Delta to produce electronic unit control receipts, which is required by the International Air Transport Association when ULDs are transferred between parties – making Delta the first airline to offer a fully automated solution for customer transactions. "Delta was the first major airline to test Bluetooth tracking technology, beginning in 2016, and has since deployed readers to 23 locations," the airline said. "By the end of 2018, the tracking system will be available on all of Delta's ULDs, with more than 1,400 readers tracking customer shipments at more than 200 airports across six continents." The airline's current GPS-enabled cargo tracking products, including a recently-announced service for highly time-sensitive shipments called Equation Critical, will continue to be available for both narrow body and wide-body aircraft shipments traveling internationally and within the US.

      <p>Dutch inland waterway container terminals are consolidating volumes to improve efficiency, with several joining the newly established North West Central Corridor (NWCC).</p>
      <p>Spearheaded by TMA Logistics, CTU Utrecht and VCL Velsen, the NWCC bundles cargoes to improve capacity utilisation of inland vessels and cut waiting times at Rotterdam's deepsea terminals.</p>
      <p>This week, the CTU Lelystad, HOV Harlingen and Hasselt's Westerman Multimodal Logistics terminals announced they would be joining the initiative.</p>
      <p>"The establishment of this corridor means we can expect significant improvements in our performance," said Tim van der Roest, general manager at Westerman Multimodal Logistics .</p>
      <p>"[And it will also] offer our clients something to which they are entitled: a reliable, affordable CO2-saving transport alternative."</p>
      <p>Eight terminals are now participating in the project, which launched in February, resulting in a total shipment volume of 6,500 teu a week. According to the group, this adds approximately 100,000 teu to the 250,000 teu currently shipped via this trade route.</p>
      <p>NWCC said: "A partnership such as this results in a sustainable and reliable barge product and also contributes to the modal shift from transport by road to transport by vessel."</p>
      <p>Alongside fewer handling delays at terminals, schedule reliability has improved by more than 95%, it claimed.</p>
      <p>Barge congestion has blighted European inland waterways for years and while the port of Antwerp announced an upgraded barge traffic system (BTS) last May, problems persist.</p>
      <p>"This is not surprising, given that the crux of the problem is the lack of dedicated barge berths and capacity," one source told The Loadstar. "Plans for consolidation centres for less than 30 moves (per barge call) had been announced, but there has been no update on progress since."</p>
      <p>As such, the efforts seen via the NWCC were welcomed by port authorities in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Hinterland manager at the port of Amsterdam Rob Smit said both he and his opposite number in Rotterdam were "delighted" by the initiative.</p>
      <p>"It's a fantastic development that demonstrates the added value of cooperation," said Mr Smit. "By bundling capacity, knowledge and cargo, they are making a real difference, resulting in an improved logistics product that also makes transport by water more attractive."</p>

      <p>Volga-Dnepr Airlines has organised the delivery of a 38-ton crankshaft from Mexico to India. The flight from Apodaca to Mumbai was chartered by DHL Global Forwarding, with the shipment packaged in a 7-metre long box alongside some support equipment required for loading. Within 12 hours of receiving the request, Volga-Dnepr's logistics specialists developed several loading and packaging options for the customer. This quick response, and Volga Dnepr's ability to provide a bespoke cargo platform for the required weight distribution, reduced the lead-time for the uplift. Ekaterina Andreeva, deputy commercial director, Volga-Dnepr Charter Cargo Operations, said: "Our unique ramp-loading IL-76TD-90VD freighter is equipped with onboard cranes and winches which facilitate optimised loading." For the first nine months of 2018, Volga-Dnepr has recorded an increase of 6% in cargo transportation for the energy and heavy machinery industry.</p>

      <p>Port of Liverpool owner Peel Ports is set to launch a container rail service to offer shippers integrated quayside-to-inland destination distribution.</p>
      <p>Peel told attendees at last week's London International Shipping Week it was in "advanced contract discussions with both a rail provider and shippers, with the aim of running the first services before the end of 2017".</p>
      <p>It would be a first for the UK's north-west container gateway, which has spent the past few years touting itself as a port-centric alternative to the southern ports of Felixstowe, Southampton and London.</p>
      <p>Jerome Wildsmith, head of supply chain at retailer B&amp;M, said: "Routing through the port of Liverpool has already saved us the equivalent of four million road miles, massively cutting our onward transport costs, reducing the carbon emitted and reducing the likelihood of delays on the UK network.</p>
      <p>"We are excited about the possibilities this new service will provide for our growing operation."</p>
      <p>Gary Hodgson, Peel Ports' strategic projects director, said: "This is the next step in our journey to provide shippers with a more integrated, end-to-end answer for their cargo needs. It's also an important milestone in our evolution as a company, and underlines how serious we are about being a genuine partner in the supply chain community."</p>
      <p>However, he added there were hinterland infrastructure issues that needed to be addressed.</p>
      <p>"There are generally good connections on routes heading north and south, but cross-country is a real problem. It's long overdue that the east-west infrastructure was brought into the 21st century so we can expand rail freight usage and reduce the impact of longer-distance road haulage."</p>
      <p>Liverpool gained a further fillip yesterday after Dutch shortsea operator WEC Lines announced a new weekly service connecting the port with Huelva, Vigo, Leixoes and Dublin next week, operating 300 teu vessels – although it expects vessels sizes "to grow significantly once trade develops".</p>
      <p>WEC Lines MD Nico Valkenier said: "We are delighted to announce a new maritime link connecting both Huelva in the south of Spain and Vigo in the north of Spain with Liverpool and Dublin. In addition, this new service will improve connection times from Leixoes to Liverpool and Dublin."</p>
      <p>Last year WEC Lines began weekly calls at Liverpool connecting with Lisbon, Setubal, Leixoes and Sines.</p>
      <p>Jouke Schaap, container port director at Peel Ports, said: "This further underlines what we've been saying about how the dynamics of the UK logistics sector is changing. Shipping directly into the north-west of the UK provides cargo owners with the chance to reduce costs, congestion and carbon emissions by getting closer to their end market."</p>

      <p>Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) and Sjømatterminalen have signed an MOU to operate the Seafood Centre at Oslo Airport, which will handle up to 250,000 tons a year.</p>
      <p>Norway accounts for half of the air cargo generated in the Nordic region, and Oslo was the fastest growing cargo airport in Europe with 36 per cent.</p>
      <p>Of the 185,000 tons flown in and out of the airport, 90,000 tons was seafood, and Norwegian seafood as air cargo is expected to reach 230,000 tons in 2018.</p>
      <p>Construction on the terminal is expected to commence in April 2019 and the opening is scheduled for 2021.</p>
      <p>Avinor Oslo Airport director of cargo, Martin Langaas says: "This is a unique opportunity to define the future of cool chain logistics for seafood as air cargo. The Seafood Centre at Oslo Airport will increase the competitiveness of Norwegian Seafood globally and industrialise the handling.</p>
      <p>"With an experienced international handler as WFS, we believe Oslo Airport will increase its competitive advantage as the preferred cargo hub in Northern Europe."</p>
      <p>Oslo Airport executive vice president, Øyvind Hasaas adds: "We have listened to the exporters and their needs to ensure quality and time to market. I believe the dedication from the Seafood Exporters in this project is an acknowledgement of the project itself.</p>
      <p>"The Seafood Centre will create value for all of Norway and increase the competitiveness of Norwegian Seafood globally."</p>
      <p>WFS executive vice president cargo EMEAA, John Batten says: "The Seafood industry is a unique opportunity for us to share our experience and excellence in air cargo handling. We look forward to opening a dedicated facility at Oslo Airport that is fully adapted to the future needs of the Seafood industry.</p>
      <p>"Our terminal will be a game changer in the handling of Seafood as air cargo and be an important part of ensuring the future growth of one of Norway's most important industries."</p>

      <p>The 240,000-square-foot second phase of Chicago O'Hare's US$220 million cargo development project came online last week, as a 15 percent year-over-year increase in year-to-date cargo volumes puts the Midwest airport on track to handle 1.8 million tonnes in 2017.</p>
      <p>The northeast cargo development is backed by a $160 million investment by Aeroterm and $62 million of airport funds. Burak, Cargolux and Swissport are the tenant operators.</p>
      <p>The addition of 747-8 capable aircraft ramps provides 50 percent additional cargo handling capacity, which, upon completion, will feed into 800,000 square-feet of warehousing and apron pavement. The facility will have space for 15 widebody aircraft to unload at any given time.</p>
      <p>The airport says that phase three should open in two to three years, also ahead of schedule, but has not provided a specific date yet.</p>
      <p>O'Hare benefits from its central geography and connectivity to regional manufacturing and other airports. International trade is also booming, particularly with China and other Asian countries.</p>

      <p>IAG Cargo is hoping its recently launched time-critical product will prove popular with shippers utilising new bellyhold capacity between New Orleans and London. Earlier today, IAG announced it would launch the first ever direct service from London to Louisiana from March 26 utilising a Boeing 787-8 aircraft with bellyhold capacity of up to 15 tonnes. IAG Cargo commercial director David Shepherd anticipated that the service would be popular for machinery parts and oil and gas components produced in the area. He added that IAG Cargo's recently launched Critical product for emergency shipments and offering a guarantee to fly, could prove particularly popular with these shippers. The service operates between London Heathrow and New Orleans International.</p>

      <p>Finnair Cargo is to join IAG Cargo's Partner Plus enhanced interline cooperation programme. Partners in the scheme enjoy confirmed bookings and higher priority for loading with IAG Cargo, the freight arm of British Airways and Iberia. Other members of the scheme are Qatar Airways, Japan Airlines, the Avianca group and American Airlines. Customers will gain access to markets in South and North America as well as Africa, taking advantage of IAG's connections via London Heathrow and Madrid. For IAG Cargo the attraction includes Finnair's strategic destinations in north east Asia. Finnair's chief commercial officer, Juha Järvinen, commented: "This closer cooperation with IAG Cargo will provide our customers better access to many markets beyond our own network. "This is an innovative way to grow reach and one that we believe will prove mutually beneficial to IAG Cargo and ourselves." • Finavia Corp is to renovate Helsinki Airport's main runway during the summer as part of a €900m development programme to strengthen the Finnish airport's position as a major northern European hub.  The work will take place between May and early August, but is not expected to affect traffic significantly and all wide-body and high-volume routes will operate as normal.</p>

      <p>Freight forwarder Kuehne+Nagel (K+N) saw airfreight volumes grow at almost double the market rate during the first half of the year, with performance improving during the second quarter. The Switzerland-headquartered freight forwarder saw first-half airfreight demand increase by 18% year on year to 731,000 tons, while the overall market increased by around 10%. During the second quarter, demand increased by 20.9%. K+N noted in the pharma, aerospace and perishables industries, while strong demand for industry specific solutions made a "significant contribution" to the improved figures. The company also noted strong exports from Europe and Asia. First-half airfreight turnover increased by the lower amount of 13.7% year on year to Sfr2.2bn and earnings before interest and tax were up 2.7% on last year to Sfr151bn. Profits in the first quarter and to a lesser extent the second quarter were affected by improvements in freight rates and the lag in passing these increases through to customers. Margin pressure is ongoing, the company said. Overall, the company saw revenues increase 8.2% to Sfr8.8bn, earnings before interest declined by 0.6% to Sfr452m, and earnings were flat at Sfr356m. K+N International chief executive Detlef Trefzger said: "The result of the first half of 2017 is a clear evidence of our growth-oriented business strategy as well as efficient cost management, which enabled us to counter the ongoing pressure on margins in seafreight and airfreight. "The remarkable improvements of results in contract logistics and overland are mainly due to the successful implementation of our market strategies. "During the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on volume growth, productivity increases and the scaling of industry-specific solutions." K+N International chairman of the board of directors Joerg Wolle added: "The half-year results of 2017 reflect the continuous strength of our Group which makes us confident for its further development despite that seafreight and airfreight markets can be expected to remain demanding and volatile. "Kuehne + Nagel remains committed to its proven strategy and continues to invest in growing markets and industry segments. With acquisitions, as the ones announced today, we are ideally complementing our organic growth and strengthen our position in a still fragmented market." Earlier today, the company announced it had expanded its global perishables network with the acquisition of sector specialist forwarders Commodity Forwarders Inc in the US and Trillvane in Kenya.

      <p>HONG Kong Air Cargo Terminals (Hactl) has signed a contract to handle cargo for S7 Airlines and Silk Way Airlines.</p>
      <p>Both airlines started services into Hong Kong (China) on 2 November. Azerbaijan's Silk Way began twice-weekly freighter services on a 744F aircraft operating Hong Kong–Baku (Azerbaijan)–Istanbul (Turkey) –Milan Malpensa (Italy), returning by the same route.</p>
      <p>Silk Way's all-freighter fleet comprises 16 aircraft: two 747-400Fs, eight Il-76s, two Stage 4-compliant Il-76 90SWs and four An-12s. The airline is expected to receive an additional 767-300F by mid-2012, when new routings will be developed. The carrier operates scheduled and charter flights to over 50 destinations, including points in Afghanistan, Iraq and west Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>Hactl provides the airline with cargo handling services including physical cargo handling, air cargo documentation and ramp handling services.</p>
      <p>"We have great hopes for Hong Kong, as the latest addition to our growing international freighter network via central Asia," Nidjat Babayev, business development deputy director of Silk Way Airlines, said.</p>
      <p>Hact is also providing services for Siberia's S7 Airlines' A320 belly cargo to Hong Kong from Vladivostok (Russia).</p>
      <p>"With initially limited capacity for cargo on this new service, we will focus on high-yield traffic and interlining. Hactl's impressive express facilities, and the large number of carriers handled within their facility, create interesting opportunities for us," China and southeast Asia general manager Vadim Shevalye comments.</p>

      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has transported KhalifaSat, the first satellite developed and built by Emirati engineers in the UAE. As the first step in its journey to space, KhalifaSat was flown from Dubai to Incheon International Airport in South Korea on a chartered Emirates SkyCargo Boeing 777 freighter. Emirates SkyCargo also unveiled a special branded truck to mark the event.   The KhalifaSat project was launched in 2013 with the aim of manufacturing the first space satellite on UAE soil. Following its launch in 2018, the remote sensing satellite will provide images of earth for  a variety of industries. "Over the years Emirates SkyCargo has transported a wide variety of unusual cargo but being able to transport the first satellite manufactured in the UAE is a unique honour. We are delighted to bring our expertise in air transportation to the table on this historic and momentous occasion," said Nabil Sultan, Emirates Divisional senior vice president, cargo. "Emirates SkyCargo worked with us over a three month period to make sure that the entire transportation process went smoothly," said Salem Al Marri, assistant director general for scientific and technical affairs, at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC). Teams from Emirates SkyCargo and MBRSC worked together from November 2017 to prepare and plan all the steps in the movement of the sensitive cargo from Dubai to Incheon airport. The satellite was first moved from MBRSC's manufacturing facility in Dubai to the Emirates SkyCentral DWC freighter cargo terminal at Dubai World Central airport on a dedicated remotely monitored Emirates SkyCargo truck. A number of trial loading exercises were also conducted by Emirates SkyCargo and MBRSC to ensure that operations went smoothly during the actual transportation of the satellite. In addition to loading and transportation, detailed planning was involved from Emirates Skycargo to ensure aircraft and crew availability as well as obtaining all relevant permissions for operating a chartered freighter flight to Incheon International airport.

      <p>A total of 37 newbuild ultra-large container vessels (ULCV) have been deployed by ocean carriers to the Asia-North Europe tradelane so far this year, increasing capacity by 2.3% against a headhaul demand decline of 3.5%.</p>
      <p>Moreover, according to Alphaliner there are a further 13 ships of 13,800-20,000 teu stemmed for delivery by December that will potentially throw the supply chain imbalance further out of kilter.</p>
      <p>"Supply growth would have been even higher if it were not for the 75 void sailings carriers imposed on this route so far this year," said Alphaliner.</p>
      <p>This compares to 2014 when just 28 scheduled sailings were withdrawn in the January-August period.</p>
      <p>However, the consultant notes that the number of ULCV deliveries in 2016 will fall to "only" 37 albeit the pace of newbuilds leaving Asian shipyards will accelerate again the year after when some 53 units are planned to be received.</p>
      <p>A number of the newbuilds of 13,500-14,500 teu could be deployed between Asia and the US west coast, but the ULCVs of 15,000 teu and above are all slated for Asia to Europe.</p>
      <p>Indeed, when asked – following Maersk Group's H1 2015 results presentation – about the options for the redeployment of its 18,000 teu ships should the Asia-Europe downturn worsen, CEO Nils Andersen admitted that the carrier was limited to laying-up the ships.</p>
      <p>The restriction on trades for the biggest ULCVs was also no doubt the thinking behind Maersk Line's recent order for nine 14,000 teu utility ships with "a flexible operational profile" which the carrier said could be deployed on either east-west or north-south trades.</p>
      <p>Carriers are also counting on the opening of the expanded Panama Canal next year as the game changer to enable significant cascading and scrapping to take place, thus helping to rebalance the supply/ demand equation. The enlarged locks will enable vessels of up to around 13,000 teu to transit the waterway from April 2016, compared with the current limitation to 'panamax' ships of around 6,000 teu.</p>
      <p>And, not least because of the substantial fall in the price of bunker fuel in the past year (IFO 380 is now below $200 per tonne, compared with almost $600 a year ago), carriers are also taking a second look at the unit cost advantage of 18,000 teu plus ships.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the presentation of Hapag-Lloyd's H1 results yesterday, chief executive Rolf Habben Jansen said: "The incremental benefits of building ever larger vessels are coming down."</p>
      <p>He added that although there was still "some merit" in operating 18,000 – 20,000 teu ships the trade restrictions, compared to the Asia – Europe 13,000 teu "workhorses" were off putting.</p>
      <p>These comments suggest that the ocean carrier 'race to the top' to operate the biggest containership in the world may be run for now.</p>

      <p>The FAIR@Link portal has gone live for air cargo handling at Hamburg Airport Cargo Center after a six-month test phase.</p>
      <p>Hamburg Airport head of cargo Alexander Müller said: "The new platform is an important step into the digital future for us. With FAIR@Link, we can significantly improve handling processes and manage the increasing volume of traffic on the ground more efficiently.</p>
      <p>"At the same time, we increase sustainability and promote environmentally compatible growth for the location."</p>
      <p>The platform was developed by Dakosy, which also operates the community systems for the Port of Hamburg and Frankfurt Airport.</p>
      <p>A Dakosy spokesperson said: "Using FAIR@Link, freight forwarders can book time slots for deliveries, resulting in shorter waiting and handling times, more transparency along the transport chain and improved documentation for handling agents, who no longer need to re-enter duplicate data – thus avoiding mistakes and saving time.</p>
      <p>"A particular advantage of digitalization is that the system can prepare export Customs declarations and then automatically submit the electronic forms to Customs upon entry to the Hamburg Airport Customs Office geofence area."</p>
      <p>Jens Sorgenfrei, managing director of Cross Freight Internationale, one of the forwarders in the system pilot at Hamburg, said: "Transports pre-registered via FAIR@Link are handled preferentially by the handling agents at the airport. The slot bookings save us several hours every day. Processes are easier to plan. All in all, we benefit in Customs and door clearances."</p>
      <p>Jürgen Vogt, managing director of cargo handler LUG, said: "With slot booking, our EDP system receives all information before the arrival of the goods. The data does not have to be entered again when the document is received.</p>
      <p>"This enables us to save a lot of time and speed up the receiving process. With FAIR@Link, we gain more transparency into all processes and can better manage our capacities with regard to door and personnel availability."</p>
      <p>Ulrich Wrage, chief executive of Dakosy, said: "Through connectivity and intelligent process support, FAIR@Link can optimize the physical processes between companies and achieve significantly faster and more transparent processing.</p>
      <p>"In addition, the platform promotes ecological concerns, as optimized traffic management and reduced check-in and waiting times lead to CO2 savings. And it saves paper, too."</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has partnered with va-Q-tec to offer the  temperature-controlled specialist's va-Q-tainer thermal containers at stations across the German flag-carrier's global network. The va-Q-tainer is a temperature-controlled container solution for six temperature ranges from -70°C to +25°C. Negating the need for external energy sources, it is available in five sizes, and can accommodate two US pallets inside of it. Lufthansa Cargo customers shipping pharmaceutical goods are expected to particularly benefit from the availability of the passive temperature-control containers. Being able to offer the va-Q-tainer directly to its customers represents an "excellent choice in the passive refrigeration segment", according to Alexis von Hoensbroech, head of product and sales of Lufthansa Cargo. Joachim Kuhn, chief executive of Würzburg, Germany-headquartered va-Q-tec, said: "Our thermal containers provide five days temperature stability under even the most challenging conditions. "These high-performance containers will now be directly available through Lufthansa Cargo. This will have a very positive effect on Germany as the fourth-largest pharmaceutical market in the world." Kuhn described Lufthansa Cargo as a strong partner "not only in Germany but also in Asia, India, the USA and South America". At Lufthansa Cargo's home hub of Frankfurt, customers benefit from a 'Cool Center' with the latest infrastructure, cooling rooms maintained at different temperatures, a deep-freeze compartment and direct access to the apron for the fastest possible loading. va-Q-tainers are now also available there. Plus, Lufthansa Cargo offers its 'Road Feeder Service Cool' option and has a special sun-reflective film available for all temperature-sensitive shipments. Read more ULD news</p>

      <p>Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) has renewed its lease on two units it currently occupies at Heathrow Cargo Centre, the airside freight facility owned and managed by real estate investment trust SEGRO at the UK's busiest airfreight gateway.</p>
      <p>The five-year leases are for airside units at 551 Shoreham Road and 552 Shoreham Road, which respectively incorporate approximately 60,000 sq ft and 80,000 sq ft of modern warehouse space.</p>
      <p>WFS has facilities covering about 400,000 sq ft across four different units at Heathrow Cargo Centre.</p>
      <p>Steven Greenhalgh, WFS UK's finance director, observed: "These airside facilities enable us to deliver a seamless service to our customers and so it was crucial to extend our occupation for a further five years.</p>
      <p>"Heathrow is a key strategic location for our business globally and we look forward to partnering with SEGRO on any future space requirements at the airside Cargo Centre."</p>
      <p>Alan Holland, head of the Central London Business Unit at SEGRO, declared of the extension: "WFS's renewed commitment underlines not only our close working relationship but also the continued demand we are seeing for well-located industrial units that deliver airside and landside access at the UK's hub airport.</p>
      <p>"With Heathrow reporting consistently high levels of cargo being exported and imported, demand for freight handling space around the airport shows no sign of abating."</p>
      <p>The SEGRO facilities on Shoreham Road offer direct airside access at Heathrow.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month (February), WFS confirmed that it is to invest in a new pharma facility at Copenhagen Airport.</p>
      <p>Construction of the new facility will begin in April. The facility will provide end-to-end handling in a temperature-controlled environment for 2-8°C pharma products incorporating acceptance, offload, pre-storage, build-up and storage.</p>

      <p>The Cool Chain Association (CCA) brings together leaders and professionals from across the cool chain industry to network, share insights and trial new ideas at its two annual events – one on pharma and one on perishables.</p>
      <p>This week (September 23-24), at the CCA's Pharma and Biosciences Conference, delegates learnt that cool chain partners are changing their mindsets to join shippers and start-ups in shaping the supply chain of the future – smart data applications, unmanned aircraft, and supplier management solutions were on the agenda.</p>
      <p>Drones to take off? The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA)'s Celine Hourcade said that despite not yet being cost-effective or scalable, the drone sector is a new emerging industry and added that it was important for the transport sector to share its expertise to help companies developing unmanned solutions.</p>
      <p>"The pharma and the air cargo industries have the knowledge and this must be transferred and shared with the new entrants, if that happens it will be a win-win situation," she said.</p>
      <p>Drone start-ups Avy and Dronamics have set their sights on developing unmanned aircraft that will improve the final mile as well as offering cost-effective, more environmentally friendly solutions.</p>
      <p>Ivet Arabadjieva, director of business development at Dronamics, said she felt the pharma and drone industries can learn from each other.</p>
      <p>"Tell us what you need, and we can come back with ideas and with costs," she said.</p>
      <p>Avy founder Patrique Zaman, added: "We are working really hard to make sure this new air ecosystem happens, and we have been focusing on tech, regulatory issues, and also use cases, but what we found really hard is to get in touch with the rest of the value chain," he said. "We need each other if we all want to step out of our bubbles and I invite you all to think today about what we can do and make sure we can help."</p>
      <p>Medical care by air Dr Radhika Batra, founder and president of Every Infant Matters, explained that the industry was helping by finding and promoting innovative solutions to bridge the gaps in the supply chain, with drones being just one example.</p>
      <p>"There are 1.5 million children dying every year from vaccine-preventable illnesses and many more living with blindness and other disabilities that don't need to be," she said.</p>
      <p>"Major stakeholders must join together in this war against poverty and disease, if we come together, network, and share, we can surely make a difference."</p>
      <p>Winning numbers Pharma manufacturer Novo Nordisk has developed its own risk-based analysis solution that uses big data harvested from temperature loggers on its consignments to map performance and temperature excursions on trade lanes. Thanks to the solution, Novo Nordirk has scaled down costs, improved reliability, and can identify areas for improvement much more easily.</p>
      <p>"We could see that our primary distribution spend was going up and we had to do something about it," said Navid Choudhury, senior manager – distribution and logistics network, supply chain planning, Novo Nordisk. "We worked with the data that we already owned to map the lanes. Then we went to our logistics partners and connected our data with theirs so that we could identify performance on future shipments.</p>
      <p>"We found collaboration easier because we were not trying to ask so much information from the airlines."</p>
      <p>Stavros Evangelakakis, Cool Chain chairman and global product manager, Cargolux, said the industry should be thinking about how to help improve the final mile in pharma.</p>
      <p>"I am not suggesting that the air cargo industry can save all of those lives, but I want to be able to say that we came together and started a dialogue, which can help make things better," he said.</p>
      <p>Presentations from the event are available to download at coolchain.org</p>

      <p>Cosco-controlled OOCL has joined the ranks of shipping lines looking to vertically integrate logistics operations into their core container transport activities.</p>
      <p>The Hong Kong-headquartered shipping line – of which last year Chinese carrier Cosco bought a 75% stake, but has since been largely run as an independent entity – posted 2018 annual results this week, reporting a 2017 net loss of $10m transformed into a $55m net profit.</p>
      <p>Its carryings last year were 6.3% up on 2017 and reached 6.7m, with growth on its main east-west deepsea trades – the transpacific and Asia-Europe – growing by 8.9% and 14.5% respectively.</p>
      <p>The carrier said it had seen some $400m in synergy savings, since Cosco became its majority owner, "in a number of areas, including fleet and network planning, procurement, container management, IT, commercial co-ordination and marine operations".</p>
      <p>However, it was also keen to emphasis the achievements of its OOCL Logistics division, in much the same way that peers such as Maersk and CMA CGM have in recent months.</p>
      <p>"This growing part of the group provides new business opportunities and diversification, as well as consistent profitability through excellence in customer service, as well as reliability and advanced technological solutions," it said.</p>
      <p>OOCL said: "The company will design and launch more end-to-end services and products, accelerate the development of extended services and endeavour to enhance the capacity in the one-stop transportation services.</p>
      <p>"In respect of railway transportation, the company will include more countries in Central and Eastern Europe into the service scope of the China-European Sea-rail Express, focus on integrated logistics solutions, develop more end-to-end customers and complement the advantages of OOCL Logistics, accomplish the design, construction and management of end-to-end service channels and solve the 'last mile' problem."</p>
      <p>Liner industry analyst Alphaliner noted that OOCL's return to profitability was accompanied by an adjustment "to exclude the earnings from its Long Beach Container Terminal, which has been reclassified as a discontinued operation pending its sale".</p>
      <p>OOCL said this should be completed in the next few months.</p>
      <p>"2018 saw a strong performance from our terminal in Long Beach. The second phase of the terminal has now been operational for a year, and all those carefully planned designs using the latest technology and the most environmentally friendly techniques have been proven to bear fruit.</p>
      <p>"It is public knowledge that we are required to sell our interest in the Long Beach terminal, and we expect to be able to do this within the coming months," it said.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Over the past decade, Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG) has grown in importance in the air freight universe to the point that it is now the second busiest airport in the world for international cargo, behind only Hong Kong (HKG), and the third busiest for total cargo, lagging only Hong Kong and Memphis (MEM).</p>
      <p>Pactl, the biggest cargo handler at PVG, has become something of a bellwether for the state of the air freight industry, in the sense that growth or decline in cargo volume at PVG in general and Pactl in particular usually reflects what is happening to overall air freight demand, whereas HKG is subject to wider swings, and MEM handles almost no freight other the FedEx's express volume.</p>
      <p>For those looking for clues about patterns in demand for air freight, PVG also offers the advantage of being one of the first major air cargo players to report monthly results. So, given some of the negative analyses recently published about the lack of year-over-year growth in March being a harbinger of difficult times ahead, it was with more than a little interest that we looked to Pudong International at the end of last week for publication of its April cargo performance.</p>
      <p>Of course, one month, for one handler, at one airport, even if that handler/airport combination is Pactl and Shanghai Pudong International, does not absolutely guarantee anything about worldwide cargo trends, but, for what it's worth, Pactl had a very good month, reporting its April handle up 7.2 percent year-over-year to 163,000 tonnes. For the first four months of 2018, Pactl's handle was up 6.3 percent to 600,000 tonnes. International volume was up 7.4 percent in April to 155,000 tonnes, and up 6.8 percent to 569,000 tonnes for the year through April. The much smaller domestic volume was up 3.8 percent in April to 8,000 tonnes. (Most of Shanghai's domestic cargo moves through Hongqiao Airport (SHA)).</p>
      <p>Given that Pactl's reported growth is usually one or two percentage points ahead of worldwide growth, it seems reasonable to hope for year-over- year demand growth worldwide in April in the range of 5 percent to 6 percent. Not as spectacular as last year's double-digit percentage growth, but a solid result that will leave air freight players more than happy.</p>

      <p>Qantas is no longer accepting shipments of lithium ion batteries on its freighters or passenger planes due to concerns of fire or explosion. The ban applies to batteries packed on their own rather than those packed in equipment. The carrier will make an exception if a shipment of the batteries is needed for an emergency. United Airlines and Delta Airlines have already banned the batteries as cargo.</p>

      <p>UPS will strengthen its presence in healthcare logistics with the purchase of Marken, a global supply chain specialist serving the pharmaceutical and life science industries. The US-based parcels and logistics giant has entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Marken, subject to regulatory approval, which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of UPS. Financial terms were not disclosed. Teresa Finley, UPS chief marketing and business services officer, said: "Healthcare logistics is a strategic market for UPS. Our acquisition of Marken strengthens our portfolio and demonstrates our commitment to customers. "We plan to offer new solutions to our customers and generate further growth opportunities for UPS."   UPS said that clinical trials require the strict regulatory compliance, streamlined logistics services and global reach offered by Marken. The acquisition of Marken follows multiple UPS acquisitions that have expanded the company's healthcare logistics services portfolio. "We are excited to join the UPS organisation," said Wes Wheeler, Marken's chief executive. "UPS' capabilities, particularly in mature markets, will provide many opportunities for us to enhance our service offerings in clinical trials logistics. "With UPS, we will improve our efficiency, while continuing to provide our clients with the high-touch, personalized services that they have come to expect from us." Wheeler will continue to lead the Marken business. Highlighting the reasons for the acquisition, UPS said that pharmaceutical companies, clinical research organisations and contract manufacturers "rely on Marken for collection and transportation of clinical trial material and investigational medicinal products to 49,000 clinical trial sites". Marken is also involved in the shipment of biological samples from these sites to central laboratories. Said UPS in a statement: "These shipments are time- and temperature-sensitive, and their rapid, on-spec delivery is a key factor in the treatment of patients and the success of the clinical trial." Marken has more than 650 employees with an "asset-light" operating structure and 44 locations worldwide, including 10 depots that are compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). "UPS is focused on the logistics complexity of clinical trials, and the acquisition fits well into our long-term growth plans in the biopharma segment," Finley added. "Marken's significant industry expertise and flexible network, combined with UPS's vast integrated global air and ground networks, will provide the life sciences industry with an attractive portfolio of global logistics options." In July 2016, UPS announced expanded logistics capabilities for clinical trials. The company's network includes temperature-sensitive storage and transportation (from ambient and controlled-room temperature, to frozen and cryogenics), 24-hour monitoring and security. UPS now has more than 100 healthcare-dedicated facilities with 60 GMP-compliant locations strategically positioned within global markets. The Air Cargo News Life Sciences and Pharmaceuticals Air Cargo Conference will take place in London this year at the Hilton London Heathrow Airport at Terminal 4 on November 22 and 23.</p>

      <p>Austria-based leading full-range info-logistics provider, cargo-partner GmbH, will be handling weekly air and sea freight transportation of exhaust aftertreatment system for Dortmund-based Albonair.</p>
      <p>Albonair is a leading manufacturer of exhaust aftertreatment systems primarily for diesel engines used in commercial vehicles.</p>
      <p>cargo-partner has been providing logistics solutions to Albonair since last several years. It has proven ability to provide flexible supply chain management and personal consultation from a single source.</p>
      <p>Albonair specialises in developing and producing urea dosage systems for on-and off-road commercial vehicles. Since worldwide emission norms for diesel engines are becoming more stringent, the demand for cost-efficient exhaust aftertreatment solutions continues to increase.</p>
      <p>As one of the most modern providers in the market, Albonair relies on innovative technology, developed and produced in-house. The automotive sector — arguably more so than any other industry — represents the demand for efficient methods of dealing with complex supply chains, within the framework of globalised production processes.</p>
      <p>To meet requirements of a challenging business environment, cargo-partner was the best choice for Albonair, as it offered reliable and versatile logistics services, including flexible solutions in sea, and road transportation, besides customs clearance services.</p>
      <p>cargo-partner also has the capacity to handle communication, shipment tracking and documentation from a single source.</p>
      <p>Convinced by the comprehensive, process-optimised service package that was elaborated in close cooperation between Albonair and cargo-partner, Michael Franke, head of logistics projects, Albonair said: "No matter whether it's optimal transport solutions or comprehensive supply chain management, Albonair can focus on its strengths and core competencies, while cargo-partner can handle the most important logistics services to our full satisfaction."</p>
      <p>Thanks to cargo-partner's long-standing cooperation with airlines and ocean carriers, it can reliably secure cargo space for Albonair's weekly air and sea freight transports.</p>
      <p>It includes LCL services between Albonair's headquarters and its locations in Taicang, China or Chennai, India. Whenever necessary, cargo-partner also has the expertise to organises same-day emergency shipments through airfreight, from various locations. Most recently, cargo-partner handled 100 tonnes of freight for for Albonair.</p>
      <p>In addition to transport services, the door-to-door solution of cargo-partner, includes warehousing, consolidation of shipments and import customs clearance.</p>
      <p>Its spot visibility &amp; collaboration platform ensures transparency along the entire transport chain, and streamlines communication and document management for both companies.</p>

      <p>Cargolux has successfully completed the transport of two former captive whales, Little Grey and Little White, to Iceland following a 6,000 mile flight from China.</p>
      <p>The SEA LIFE Trust confirmed that Little Grey and Little White arrived yesterday afternoon at Keflavik Airport after having successfully completed the first leg of their landmark journey.</p>
      <p>The whales will now continue by truck and ferry to their new home, a large sanctuary in a natural bay on Heimaey, one of the Westman Islands, located off the southern coast of Iceland.</p>
      <p>The two belugas were transported in custom-made slings designed to their exact physical requirements, and were then placed in tailored containers.</p>
      <p>After a lorry trip from Changfeng Ocean World to Shanghai Pu Dong airport, the whales were loaded onto a specially branded Cargolux freighter.</p>
      <p>Little Grey and Little White were monitored by their care teams to ensure they remained safe and comfortable throughout the 11.30-12-hour flight.</p>
      <p>A Cargolux engineer and a team of global veterinary experts with experience in transporting marine mammals were also on board, to guarantee the whale's  welfare, whilst ensuring flight safety requirements were upheld.</p>
      <p>Andy Bool, Head of SEA LIFE Trust, said: "We're absolutely delighted Little Grey and Little White have safely touched down in Iceland. This is a complex but inspiring project and we've been working with the whales for months helping to prepare them for travelling to their new home.</p>
      <p>"We'll continue to carefully monitor the whales but we're pleased with their overall progress and welfare checks, which have been taking place throughout the relocation. The co-ordination of this project has been down to so many people and we're extremely grateful for all their hard work, and are thrilled this epic journey has gone as planned."</p>
      <p>The 747-400ERF freighter plane was welcomed onto the tarmac with a ceremonial water salute from two fire trucks firing a water arc over the plane, in celebration of Iceland's newest residents' safe arrival.</p>
      <p>Little Grey and Little White will now be transferred on board two lorries from Keflavik Airport before catching a ferry to Heimaey – off the south coast of Iceland. Once they arrive on the island, they will be placed in their dedicated sanctuary quarantine care pool for monitoring and resting after their epic journey. They will then move to their new home in the secluded open-water bay.</p>
      <p>Richard Forson, Cargolux President and Chief Executive Officer, added: "We are delighted that Little Grey and Little White enjoyed a seamless journey onboard our Cargolux aircraft. The success of this undertaking is the reflection of the dedication and commitment of teams across all of our organisations who worked tirelessly to make this happen.</p>
      <p>"This epic relocation required complex logistical efforts, and we are proud to have been part of this incredible journey. We hope that Little Grey and Little White rapidly adapt to their new home and that their story will serve as a precedent for other cetaceans held in captivity."</p>
      <p>The sheltered bay will be the world's first open water sanctuary for beluga whales in what is a ground-breaking global marine welfare project. The bay, which measures approximately 32,000 sq m with a depth of up to 10m has been chosen to provide a more natural sub-Arctic environment and wilder habitat.</p>
      <p>How will Little Grey and Little White travel from China to Iceland?</p>
      <p>The complex logistical challenge of transporting two beluga whales by air, land and sea is being carefully planned by a team of global experts with experience in transporting marine mammals.</p>
      <p>The 6,000-mile journey will take around 24 hours to complete – from the time Little Grey and Little White leave Changfeng Ocean World in Shanghai until they arrive at the sanctuary on Heimaey Island.</p>
      <p>1. The journey will begin at Changfeng Ocean World in Shanghai. Each beluga will be individually lifted onto specially designed stretchers measured to their physical requirements and carefully placed into specially built transportation boxes before they are lifted out of the aquarium by crane and placed carefully into two lorries</p>
      <p>2. Little Grey and Little White will then travel by road, from Changfeng Ocean World to Pu Dong International airport, where a specially chartered Cargolux cargo plane will be waiting on the runway to fly them to Keflavik Airport (the main International airport) in Iceland.</p>
      <p>3. Little Grey and Little White will then be transferred on board two lorries from Keflavik Airport before catching a ferry to Heimaey – off the south of Iceland.</p>
      <p>4. Once they arrive in Vestmannaeyjar via ferry, two lorries will drive a short distance to the main town of Vestmannaeyjar where Little Grey and Little White will be transferred to the beluga sanctuary landside facility and placed into a special care pool so they can be assessed following their journey.</p>
      <p>5. They will spend a minimum of 40 days in the sanctuary quarantine care pool for monitoring and resting after their epic journey before moving to their new home in the open-water bay in the summer.</p>

      <p>HOT on the heels of news that a robo-freighter is in development comes the announcement that plans are afoot for a robo-pallet.</p>
      <p>The US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has put out a call for companies to develop intelligent mechanical platforms that can load cargo autonomously. In the solicitation, the AFRL stipulated that the "intelligent robo-pallet" must be able to move on its own, lift and stack as cargo masters instruct, possess a built-in navigation capability, fit and operate in tight quarters, and talk with all other similar technology.</p>
      <p>"The technology developed by this effort will have direct application to commercial air-cargo handling, shipping and receiving, and warehousing," the AFRL said.</p>

      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo has added Colombo in Sri Lanka and Dublin in Ireland to its extensive Pharma Network – bringing the total it services to 73 destinations.</p>
      <p>Colombo was added to its Pharma Network on 15 May, while Dublin's pharma operation begins on 12 June, when Qatar Airways commences its B787 Dreamliner flights to the same city.</p>
      <p>The carrier says Ireland has become one of the leading global hubs for the pharma industry, with nine of the top ten largest pharma companies operating in the country.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka, while also an importer of pharma and healthcare products, expects future earnings from pharma exports to surpass tea export revenue, following the launch of a pharma manufacturing project at the country's Export Processing Zone last year.</p>
      <p>Qatar Airways' chief officer for cargo, Ulrich Ogiermann says: "We are experiencing consistent growth each year in the airfreight of pharmaceuticals and healthcare products globally.</p>
      <p>"The expansion of our pharma network to these destinations gives us the opportunity to support expanding pharma businesses in Sri Lanka, the Republic of Ireland and globally. Customers stand to benefit from a seamless cool chain as well as uncompromised service standards.</p>
      <p>"Qatar Airways Cargo customers in the Republic of Ireland will also greatly benefit in terms of time and cost savings, as they will no longer have to truck their freight from the Republic of Ireland to United Kingdom."</p>
      <p>The addition of Colombo and Dublin to the pharma network will enable Qatar Airways Cargo to offer its specialist pharmaceuticals transport solution, 'QR Pharma' to an expanding global customer base.</p>

      <p>The freight business is moving online, but not everyone is eager to get on board. The most recent annual "State of Online Logistics Sales 2016 Mystery Shopping Survey," conducted by Freightos, found that large forwarders have made surprisingly little progress with their online freight booking platforms. "I think it's time for this industry to catch up," said Freightos CEO, Zvi Schreiber.</p>
      <p>However, behind the scenes, Schreiber said that the wakeup call is beginning to be heard, and forwarders are scrambling to catch up with early movers like Kuehne + Nagel and Delta Airlines.</p>
      <p>As most airfreight industry insiders are aware, the capabilities and sophistication of back-end IT systems are rapidly advancing, but what about on the front end? Is the customer experience dramatically different? For shippers looking to obtain quotes and book directly online with a forwarder, the answer seems to vary dramatically, according to Israel-based Freightos.</p>
      <p>For the "mystery shopping" experiment, Freightos interacted with the online booking portals of the world's top 20 global freight forwarding websites (the same ranking that was used in Air Cargo World's Power 25 list), and requested identical quotes for a less-than-container-load (LCL) shipment from a city in China to Chicago. The quote request included sufficient information for a forwarder to respond with a quote, including load type, harmonized system (HS) code, weight, dimensions, incoterms and a statement that the shipper would compare the quote with a direct competitor.</p>
      <p>Before diving further into the results, it should be noted that Freightos is a company that not only sells online quote-automation software, but also operates its own online freight marketplace, so the results of this exercise are not free from bias. Even so, the results indicate the majority of the world's top forwarders are not equipped to offer fast, automated freight quotes through online portals.</p>
      <p>Despite incessant talk about innovation in IT and digitization throughout the forwarding industry, the results from 2016's survey were actually worse than the conclusions from 2015. Schreiber told Air Cargo World, "the results from this year were abysmal. With the exception of Kuehne + Nagel, there was no improvement. In fact, the average quotation actually took longer."</p>

      <p>CORE Transport Technologies has shipped outs its 15,000th COREInsight Bluetooth Tracking tag for active deployment since its launch in October 2017.</p>
      <p>The tracking tag started as an idea in early 2016, and the patented container and pallet tags utilise Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to actively track assets.</p>
      <p>CORE says compared to other tracking solutions used to manage assets and shipments, the COREInsight Tracking brings dramatic increases in battery life, field of view, ease of installation and cost effectiveness.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand-based company says patented plug-and-play readers can convert any location into an Internet of Things (IoT) hub within minutes and public deployment started after launch customers Delta Air Lines, Air New Zealand and Alaska Airlines along with ACL Airshop realised the benefits of automated ULD tracking and an interconnected fleet.</p>
      <p>Over 15 airlines are in various stages of implementation with CORE's technology resulting in full deployment of BLE on their fleets.</p>
      <p>CORE chief executive officer, Ian Craig says: "Whilst others might have wishful upstart efforts with Bluetooth Low Energy or similar technologies for the Airline industry, it's factual and fair to say we are already there, with a very large proven network that is only getting bigger and more effective as a logistics tool every week, every month. We are accelerating our progress for our Air Carrier customers, others are merely playing catch-up."</p>
      <p>CORE's tracking network extends to over 100 major airports and 650 sub-locations worldwide, with the addition of 30 new cities and 85 sub-locations last month.</p>
      <p>As Bluetooth in air transport evolves, CORE says its technology can be used not only to track ULDs but also manage other customer owned resources, with airlines using the COREInsight portfolio to track aircraft tooling, galley carts, cargo and baggage carts, tractor/trailers and ground service equipment.</p>

      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has flown an 84 tonnes load of heavy machinery and steel parts for a new bridge being built across the Nile River in Uganda. The UAE-based passenger and freighter aircraft operator was awarded the charter by a Japanese construction company to carry the load from Tokyo's Narita Airport to Entebbe via the cargo carrier's hub in Dubai. The bridge, located at Jinja near the source of the Nile, is expected to improve transport flows on the Northern Corridor route which links Uganda and neighbours Burundi, Rwanda and eastern DRC to Kenya. To carry the cargo, Emirates SkyCargo used one of its Boeing 777 freighters. Ravishankar Mirle, Emirates vice president, cargo commercial, Far East and Australasia, said: "This was a very high profile charter for what clearly is a very important project in Uganda." He added: "Our field teams in Japan and Uganda along with our Dubai based Freighter and Charters and hub operations teams worked very hard to ensure the success of this charter."</p>

      <p>Gatwick Airport is gaining another long-haul connection with the launch of flights to Shanghai in December operated by China Eastern Airlines.</p>
      <p>Shanghai has been the showpiece of China's dramatic economic growth and is a global financial centre.</p>
      <p>It drives growth in the Yangtze River Economic Zone, a region accounting for 20 per cent of China's GDP and responsible for a third of the country's imports and exports.</p>
      <p>The services to Shanghai will begin on 7 December 2018, with Airbus A330-200 flights departing Gatwick on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 12.00h, and flying to Shanghai Pudong Airport, providing more than 3,700 tonnes of cargo capacity each year.</p>
      <p>Gatwick Airport chief executive officer, Stewart Wingate says: "I'm delighted to welcome China Eastern to Gatwick and look forward to the start of this vital new link to Shanghai which, like London, is undoubtedly one of the world's most important cities and business hubs."</p>
      <p>The airport has also released its figures for July, with monthly cargo volumes rising 28.8 per cent to 10,129 tonnes, and by 26.3 per cent on a moving annual basis to 109,315 tonnes, helped by new long-haul routes.</p>
      <p>Wingate says: "July's traffic figures demonstrate that Gatwick's long-haul network is driving the airport's growth. These connections to China and other non-European countries will take on extra significance in a post-Brexit Britain as we become more reliant on them to generate vital growth through trade and by exploiting the other business opportunities that they provide."</p>

    <title>IATA: April sees fuel prices pick up and load factors decline</title>

      <p>The latest Airlines Financial Monitor from IATA indicates that cargo load factors have dropped back to levels last seen at the start of 2017. Across the air cargo industry, the freight load factor fell 0.5% in April compared to the same month of 2017. Capacity (available freight tonne-km, AFTK) increased 5.1% year on year in April while demand as measured in revenue freight tonne-km (FTK) rose 4.1%. The report added: "The upward trend in SA seasonally adjusted FTKs has fallen below that of AFTKs over the past eight months or so. In fact, April was just the second time in 21 months in which the annual pace of capacity growth has exceeded that of demand." IATA said that unless demand picks up in the coming months, annual FTK growth will slow towards mid-2018. Fuel costs continue to be a concern for airlines, with oil prices having risen due to tighter supply as well as ongoing geopolitical tensions. The price of Brent crude oil stood at $76/bbl, almost 60% higher than a year ago, at the time the report was prepared. IATA noted that oil prices are expected to dip below the $70/bbl mark by 2020, however. Sign up to receive Air Cargo News direct to your inbox for free</p>
