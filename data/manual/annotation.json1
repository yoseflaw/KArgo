The facility is expected to be in operation in April 2017. Once finished, the terminal will have 31,000 square metres of warehousing space and 6,000 square metres of office space. It will be capable of handling 450,000 tonnes annually. The airline also has the option of expanding the site by a further 10,000 square metres and 100,000 tonnes annually.|The terminal will be split into three areas. This will feature a 3,000 square metre pharmaceuticals area with an average temperature of plus 20 degrees Celsius. There will be storage rooms for pharma needing to be kept from two to eight degrees Celsius. There will also be a frozen storage section.|Another section will be a 3,500 square metre perishables area. This will include a packing area for perishables needing to be stored at six to eight degrees Celsius. There will also be a storage area for products needing to be kept at two degrees Celsius. General cargo will also be stored separately. The development is part of a Finnair fleet development strategy that will see the Finnish carrier receive 19 Airbus A350s over the next five years, including four this year. This will result in cargo capacity being expanded and the opportunity to handle more volumes.|Speaking at the ceremony, Vauramo says the terminal investment is an integral part of the strategy to renew its widebody fleet. \"This cargo terminal is part of the strategy that will see us increase our bellyhold cargo. It is an important step for us. With this new terminal we are able to raise the bar for our customers with more cargo terminal services and specialist services that guarantee cool conditions for cargo needing to be temperature controlled.\" The facility fits in with Finnair's plans to focus on specialist types of cargo such as pharma and perishables, Vauramo explains: \"We want to specialise and find those niche cargo goods that are high-end in value.\"|The terminal will also have an automated unit load device (ULD) system with a capacity for 550 ULDs and an IT system that will aim to optimise operational processes.

He adds it gives Finnair the chance to understand, \"what cargo it is dealing with and when\". Once the terminal opens, he says, it will result in less cargo transited through the hub on trucks.

The money, from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and TKI Dinalog, the Dutch Institute for Advanced Logistics, will fund data collection and monitoring of Pharma Gateway Amsterdam (PGA) shipments to identify exceptions such as temperature excursions. The information will then be used to design a model to alert shippers when there has been an issue with their consignment. Schiphol has teamed up with Air France KLM Cargo, Cargonaut, and PGA members for the project, which starts this month and with results expected later this year.

First ULDs are unloaded from aircraft and the pallets contained within are taken out by forklift and placed on a yellow tray on the pallet handler and scanned. The pallet is then automatically whisked 12 m up onto the mezzanine floor where it is transferred to the correct area of the hub before heading back to ground level to be taken off the yellow tray and placed in a ULD waiting to be loaded on an aircraft heading to the shipment's final destination. The system can handle shipments with a maximum weight of 170kg and measuring 2 m wide with a depth and height of 1 m each.

{"id": 256, "text": "LUG ramps up Frankfurt slot management|Ground handler LUG Aircargo is implementing a new ramp service and time slot management system at its Cargo City South terminal in Frankfurt airport from mid-May. The software automatically allocates loading bays for the delivery and collection of shipments and for road feeder services. Users can reserve slots at the ramp in advance by entering their vehicle's expected time of arrival, whether it is an import or export and other consignment information such as weight or number of pieces into LUG's web-based aiRSS software. After validating the information, the system assigns a time slot and ramp based on the user's arrival information or makes an alternative suggestion if there are no available slots at the requested time. It also calculates the loading or unloading time based on the freight volume and initiates the documentation process before arrival. On arrival at the LUG terminal, drivers proceed directly to the pre-booked ramp. Identification and shipping documents are presented at the LUG Customer Service Centre, where they are compared with the pre-arrival information, and the cargo is then loaded or unloaded. If the vehicle arrives before the booked time slot, misses it or if the freight details have changed, the information can be updated on the website or via mobile devices, even at short notice, as the system allows for flexible rescheduling,  assigning a new time slot or ramp if necessary and alerting LUG staff to the change. Forwarders who use the Fair@Link Frankfurt cargo community system to pre-register transport can continue to do so – the pre-arrival notice is forwarded to LUG and automatically imported into aiRSS. Customers who arrive at the terminal without a pre-requested time slot will continue to be served on a first come, first-served basis but this might entail a waiting time if all ramps are occupied or pre-booked. LUG sales executive Sven Kaufmann said the system would benefit customers as \"it shortens idle and lead times and accelerates loading, unloading and the documentation processes. \"Forwarders can see on the website if we are busy or if capacity is available. Based on that information they can choose a time slot which enables them to drive directly to the booked loading ramp.\" Manager of the customer service centre and project manager aiRSS, Philipp Wahlig, added: \"Freight forwarders benefit from the accelerated handling procedures and increased planning security. \"LUG benefits by increasing its ability to improve and adjust staff and equipment deployment to better match the workload.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 3, "IRRELEVANT"]]}

'White Cover' is primarily used for protecting perishables such as fruits and vegetables having a higher temperature tolerance, whereas 'White Cover Advanced' is used for securing packaged pharmaceuticals shipments which are more susceptible to increase in heat. The new White Cover Xtreme will help shield temperature sensitive shipments, including pharmaceuticals, which travel through extreme and variable weather conditions from origin to destination.Emirates SkyCargo is the first air cargo carrier globally to be introducing DuPont's Tyvek Xtreme W50 material in its White Cover protection solutions focused on ground handling. Working together with the world's leading air cargo carrier with a global network of over 155 destinations, DuPont gets critical feedback to refine the research and development for new products & solution in cargo cool chain. The two companies worked extensively on ground trials for White Cover Xtreme and roll out for customers will begin in late August 2017.The collaboration between Emirates SkyCargo and DuPont on the new White Cover Xtreme is part of an existing agreement between the two companies to develop new temperature protection solutions, in particular thermal covers, for the air cargo industry. The agreement was renewed for a further period of two years until 2019 during the Air Cargo Europe event in Munich in May this year.

{"id": 222, "text": "United approves CSafe's RAP temperature-controlled container|United Cargo has approved the CSafe RAP temperature-controlled container for the shipping of pharmaceuticals and other life science commodities across its network under its specialised TempControl product. CSafe's RAP container makes use of heating and compressor-driven cooling technologies, along with effective insulation, to maintain constant temperatures within the ULD even at extreme ambient temperatures ranging from -30°C to +54°C – said to be the broadest operating range in the industry. The container has a capacity of 6.68 cubic metres, thereby easily accommodating up to four standard US pallets or five standard Euro pallets. It has a battery run time of more than 120 hours. \"The CSafe RKN container has been a key component of our TempControl service since 2010,\" recalled Jan Krems, president of United Cargo. \"The demand for pharmaceuticals and other health care products grows every year, and customers and patients worldwide are seeking expanded capacity across our TempControl network,\" he pointed out. \"With the new CSafe RAP container, we can meet this need using the innovative CSafe technology that is proven by years of impeccable performance and trusted by our customers.\" Jeff Pepperworth, chief executive of CSafe Global, added: \"The combination of United Cargo's expansive TempControl network and the superior performance of the CSafe RAP container offers life science companies a powerful and reliable solution to move temperature-sensitive healthcare products to patients across the globe.\" TempControl customers can lease the new CSafe RAP container directly from CSafe Global or through United Cargo.
