      <p>Brussels Airport unveiled the latest version of its Airside Pharma Transporter at the TIACA Air Cargo Forum in Paris and said it has proved so popular it is already considering ordering an extra one. Initially, four of the units have been put into action, but demand from cargo handlers means that the airport is already considering an extra dolly. The trailer-mounted insulated vehicle can operate autonomously for several days without being plugged into a mains supply. During the winter it can operate for around for around 24 hours without needing to be charged and in the summer this is extended to 36 hours. The refrigeration unit also reaches the required temperature much faster allowing it to be used several times a day. Temperature and location of the transporter can be monitored in real time and, thanks to an innovative insulation and cooling system, can maintain temperature even in strong sunlight, said Brussels airport. In conjunction with the launch of the dolly, the airport also launched a booking app for mobile devices. Nathan De Valck, cargo account manager at Brussels Airport, said that cargo handlers can use this to book the dolly for a single four hour period, or on a recurring basis. The handlers then pay for this usage. The original version of the Pharma Transporter was introduced last year at the airport's Brucargo terminal, but this is an "active" version, while the other was "passive". Brussels Airport chief executive, Arnaud Feist, said: "We innovated earlier with IATA by developing the CEIV guarantee certificate for the cold chain; our airport was also the first to achieve this worldwide standard. With the new Airside Pharma Transporter we have developed an efficient product that, thanks to the solar panels, is also extremely environmentally friendly." De Valck said that the airport had involved the entire cargo community – from forwarders to airlines, shippers and handlers – in developing the facility. As a group they had identified temperature protection, timings, traceability, cost and ability to handle various sizes of cargo as the main requirements. He said they could have developed a system that guaranteed temperatures at set levels but decided this would have been cost prohibitive. Instead, the dolly they developed will contain cargo with a range of five to 25 degrees Celsius, stopping any pharma shipments from being affected by spikes in temperature. Brussels says that other airports are now showing interest in the system.  The Air Cargo News Life Sciences and Pharmaceuticals Air Cargo Conference will take place in London this year at the Hilton London Heathrow Airport at Terminal 4 on November 22 and 23.</p>

      <p>Air France-KLM opened what it is calling "the world's first" combination-carrier-operated sorting system capable of handling package-level freight. Air France-KLM has pursued a number of cargo strategies over the years with limited success, however this new strategy suggests that the carrier's ambitions are still intact.</p>
      <p>The new facility "allows us to keep pace with the rapid increase in post and express consignments," said Marcel de Nooijer, executive vice president of KLM Cargo. "The system is faster and smarter, allowing us to offer better service to our customers," adding that "e-commerce is a fast-growing branch in the cargo industry."</p>
      <p>The package facility also dovetails with 12Send, a new intra-Europe same-day delivery service launched in cooperation with Netherlands-based Parcel International. The service is part of an effort by Air France-KLM to utilize more of its bellyhold capacity, especially on its extensive European network.</p>
      <p>An initial pilot program for same-day service was launched on KLM routes between Amsterdam (AMS) and Barcelona (BCN) in October.</p>
      <p>Judging by the pictures, the new facility is quite similar (if on a smaller scale) to some of the integrator hubs. With combination carriers reaching for a larger share of growing e-commerce volumes, this latest development could put Air France-KLM ahead of the pack.</p>

      <p>Brussels Airport is continuing to invest in services and products for the pharmaceutical sector, offering new infrastructure and technology including blockchain.</p>
      <p>The airport is investing €100 million in the construction of logistics buildings with 100,000m2 in the cargo area.</p>
      <p>Half of this infrastructure will be specifically designed to handle high-quality and temperature-sensitive goods such as pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>BRUcloud was launched as an open data sharing platform where companies in the scheme gather information through apps.</p>
      <p>Recent integration of new technologies such as blockchain has made part of the work paperless, which saves time and improves efficiency.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport was the first airport in the world to be awarded IATA CEIV Pharma certification and has developed products for the pharmaceutical industry such as the Airside Pharma Transporter to move cargo on the tarmac.</p>
      <p>It was also a founding member of Pharma.Aero along with Miami International Airport and Singapore Changi Airport, and has created pharma corridors to Montevideo and Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Arnaud Feist, CEO of Brussels Airport Company says: "We continue to invest heavily in logistical infrastructure that is adapted to the specific needs of pharma and biotech, and that guaranties a cold chain, vital for medicines and vaccines. We are also developing innovative solutions based on new technology such as blockchain, which is used on our digital platform BRUcloud, and allows all stakeholders to track in real time the route of the transported goods."</p>
      <p>In 2017, €40.3 billion of medicine was exported from Belgium, accounting for 10.6% of the country's total exports.</p>
      <p>Nearly half the exports are bound for countries outside the European Union, with Catherine Rutten, CEO of pharma.be saying: "In part, it is thanks to the investments of the logistical partners, such as Brussels Airport Company, that Belgium is a preferred country for pharma exports to overseas countries. Doing so also sees our country play its part in the pursuit of the global health objectives."</p>
      <p>Belgium plays an important role in the biopharmaceutical industry, accounting for 13% of European exports, according to Tom Van Wesemael, life sciences leader at Deloitte.</p>
      <p>He says: "The significant amount of biopharma exports and infrastructure, paired with Belgium's high level of connectivity, make the country an attractive place for companies to invest and expand.</p>

      <p>As the pharmaceutical and biotech industry gets more complex and the markets they serve become more diverse, the logistics involved in transporting these highly sensitive products gets more challenging. With changing regulations, strict temperature control and strong competition, it has become imperative for those involved in the pharmaceutical supply chain to consistently innovate and evolve to meet their clients' needs.Surya Kannoth</p>
      <p>Handling pharmaceutical products is a very complex, multi-tiered process, which requires compliance with strict requirements and procedures, while also adhering to specific shippers' demands. An extremely lucrative business, pharmaceutical logistics is expected to be worth $86 billion in 2019. As it currently stands, only 0.5 million tonnes of pharmaceutical products are transported by air compared with 3.5 million tonnes using maritime trade lanes. Currently, the annual product losses associated with temperature excursions range from $2.5-$12.5 billion, a figure that IATA describes as "unacceptably high".</p>
      <p>Since the last couple of years, the air cargo industry has placed a special focus on pharmaceuticals – a growing and profitable sector. Since cold supply chains control and maintain temperature at each stage of a pharma product's transhipment journey, the industry has begun developing new trends for various components of the cold supply chain, such as packaging, storage, transportation and distribution of pharmaceuticals, to ensure that the integrity of the product's requisite temperature remains uncompromised. Innovative packaging techniques such as passive, active or semi-active packaging to maintain stable temperature of the pharma products during transit are also being used. To support the temperature-controlled logistics of pharma products, warehousing service providers are developing cold storage infrastructure for temporary storage of the pharma products.  Apart from packaging and storing, cold supply chains are using refrigerated or reefer trucks to move pharma goods from the source of manufacturing and/or distribution centers to the end consumers while maintaining the products' respective ambient temperatures.</p>
      <p>Community initiatives for flying pharmaThe main quality assurance challenge within the supply chain of pharma is mainly the fact of not having a thoroughly evaluated quality program and the lack of transparency, initiating a potential risk to the stability of the product itself and linked patient safety. The IATA CEIV pharma program has exactly pushed to have these quality standards. Meanwhile, initiatives like Pharma.Aero help in bringing shippers, airports and stakeholders in the supply chain around one table in order to take action and share best practices.</p>
      <p>Explaining how the CEIV programme came into existence, Nathan De Valck, chairman of the industry-wide initiative Pharma.Aero recaps, "During pharma shipper workshops at the Brussels Airport, we listened to pharma shippers who wanted a more reliable and transparent handling service.  Therefore, Brussels Airport took the initiative to build a quality improvement programme to align and standardise the pharma handling processes at the airport, involving all the stakeholders in the cold chain.  The initial checklist was developed in collaboration with the shippers and based on the European GDP guidelines.  After a proof of concept of the program with some local BRU cargo partners, we reached out to IATA in order to create a community certification program that would involve the global end-to-end pharma lanes, becoming the CEIV pharma program."</p>
      <p>As Valck puts it, more and more shippers underline harmonization of quality management systems, in order to close the "language gap" between two different industries, the high demanding pharmaceutical industry on one hand and of the multi-complex industry of airfreight logistics on the other hand.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is important that independent validation of the quality of logistical providers is available to guarantee a transparent and reliable process. "It is not about 'forcing' stakeholders; it is all about raising awareness. More and more shippers see Pharma.Aero as the forum in which different industries underline one vision, CEIV certification and validation. This collaboration platform will create opportunities to enlarge the common interest, to improve the standard practices and to implement continuous improvement policies," said Valck. He further impressed upon the need for quality, the need for digitization and the need for sharing as the most critical points in the supply-chain.</p>
      <p>"Through our participation in Pharma.Aero and the launch of Pharma@Changi initiative, Changi Airport Group aims to promote stronger collaboration across the supply chain. In recent years, there has been a growing demand for greater visibility in the transportation of pharma cargo. Live temperature monitoring as well as tracking of the pharma shipment's location within the airport compound are some of the common requests from shippers. In response to these requests, Pharma.Aero has launched the "Certified Pharma lanes &amp; Identification of Performance Indexes and Dashboard" initiative to provide greater transparency and reliability of the air cargo supply chain across the certified pharma lanes," explains Lim Ching Kiat, managing director, air hub development, Changi Airport.</p>
      <p>The initiative will also be evaluating prevailing technologies that can help digitise data and implement live temperature monitoring throughout the supply chain. Members of this initiative comprise of pharmaceutical shippers, airlines and airports. Another initiative is the Pharma.Aero Shippers Advisory Group, which gathers inputs from the pharmaceutical shippers to guide the air cargo industry towards improving the transport of pharmaceutical shipments by air, identifies key issues that shippers encounter and comes up with possible solutions to address these issues. "As pharmaceutical shippers and logistics players gain an appreciation of the benefits of working with IATA CEIV Pharma certified companies, we are seeing greater interest from shippers to either route their pharmaceutical cargo on IATA CEIV Pharma certified trade lane or give preference to companies which are CEIV Pharma-certified. For the year ahead, we look forward to strengthening our handling capabilities and pursuing growth opportunities with our partners to better serve the needs of pharma shippers," Kiat added.</p>
      <p>"Raising the level of quality performance has been at the forefront of the industry, covering such hot-button aspects as digitalization, transparency of information, and 100 per cent traceability at all stages of transportation. 24/7 monitoring of consignment condition and temperature status (both in the air and on the ground), access to each supply chain stakeholder 'in one call' – these are must have features and services for air cargo companies involved in the transportation of pharma products," said Fedor Novikov - global director, Pharma, AirBridgeCargo Airlines.</p>
      <p>AirBridgeCargo Airlines, one of the leading carriers for medical cargo, is upping its services in pharma transportation with its abcPharma product. The airline achieved IATA CEIV Pharma certification in 2016 and has since developed a number of special benefits for pharma customers, including the use of digital technologies to send automated notifications to all supply chain stakeholders via the Sky Fresh web platform, and supporting industry-level initiatives such as Pharma.Aero to generate a home-grown pool of logistics experts and orchestration of all internal handling procedures. These initiatives have helped ABC report significant increases in its volumes of temperature-sensitive pharma cargoes in 2017 as well as improved overall performance. In September 2017, AirBridgeCargo enhanced its pharma services further by gaining Envirotainer QEP accreditation at its global hub at Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport and in Dallas. In the following two months, ABC gained additional accreditations for its online stations in Milan, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Los Angeles and Chicago.</p>
      <p>Another important player in the transportation of pharmaceutical cargo, Emirates Skycargo, has been steadfast in offering customised transportation solution for temperature sensitive pharma. The carrier introduced Emirates Pharma, which caters to a variety of requirements from shippers and forwarders. "Since the launch of Emirates Pharma we have witnessed a strong growth in demand underlined by positive response from our customers. We continue to refine Emirates Pharma keep in line with evolution of customer needs," said Julian Sutch, manager - global cargo development, Pharma, Emirates Skycargo.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo operates the largest GDP certified multi-airport hub in Dubai and with its recent pharma corridors initiative, it is working with ground handlers at different stations to ensure a certified service for pharma cargo passing through these stations. The first 12 stations in Emirates SkyCargo's pharma corridors are spread across three continents and include Amsterdam, Brussels, Bengaluru, Cairo, Dublin, Dusseldorf, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Milan, Rome, Shanghai and Singapore.</p>
      <p>"We constantly invest in developing technologies for better temperature protection on the ramp not just in Dubai but also across our network. The product development team at Emirates has developed the Emirates SkyCargo cool dollies. We have a fleet of 50 cool dollies dedicated for pharma in Dubai. Other developments include the White Container, of which we have a fleet of 120 containers and our White Cover thermal blankets. We work with all major container rental service providers to ensure that our customers have the widest choice of containers for their shipping requirements," Sutch added. It has also developed the White CoverXtreme thermal blanket in partnership with DuPont which can guarantee robust protection for temperature sensitive pharmaceuticals under hot, weather and rainy weather conditions.</p>
      <p>In a recent development, joint venture partners Virgin Atlantic Cargo and Delta Cargo opened a new Pharma Zone at their joint facility at London Heathrow Airport. The Pharma Zone is a fully-segregated area for handling and storing pharmaceutical shipments within a strictly-regulated temperature environment with active container storage. The area will support the temperature-controlled healthcare and life-science products being carried by both airlines.</p>
      <p>Speaking about how Delta Cargo is contributing to make its pharma supply chain transparent and trustworthy, Julian Soell, managing director, operations &amp; customer experience for cargo, Delta Air Lines said, "We has done so by achieving CEIV certification along with Delta's self-handled global hub in Atlanta. Delta is the first US based cargo belly airline to achieve CEIV certification. Additionally several vendor handled stations have a mix of CEIV, GDP, WDA and QEP certifications and qualifications throughout Delta's global pharma network. Delta has and continues to invest in the Pharma program which includes facility upgrades, training, policy and procedure, quality management and of course certifications so we can confidently support our customers who expect us to be accountable for their pharma shipments."Country-specific solutions that ensure regulatory compliance.</p>
      <p>Amidst increasing regulatory focus on pharma products and their handling requirements, life sciences and healthcare companies are looking for cost efficient and country-specific solutions that ensure regulatory compliance. Shippers and freight forwarders are also becoming more vigilant while partnering with logistics companies and are choosing business partners who recognise pharma as special cargo instead of general cargo, and who provide tailor-made temperature-controlled handling solutions.</p>
      <p>In India, for instance, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducts audits on pharma manufacturing, shipping, warehousing and distribution facilities in order to check the quality standards of the drugs being shipped. Similarly, the Good Distribution Practices (GDP) certification ensures efficient transportation and handling of pharma products in line with WHO guidelines. IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) certification ensures the uniform implementation of best practices amongst all participants in the supply chain, thus minimizing the odds of a compromised pharma product.</p>
      <p>"All organisations are working towards developing and improving their infrastructure in order to meet handling and quality requirements as expected by the certifying authorities. For instance, the AISATS COOLPORT and the AISATS Air Freight Terminal are GDP certified entities. The AISATS COOLPORT, which is India's first integrated on-airport perishable cargo handling centre, has witnessed a 62 per cent increase in pharma cargo handling within the last year. This perishable handling centre also has an in-house Custom Clearance and Drug Controller Lab Testing facility, which reduces the cargo dwell time and facilitates faster cargo processing time," reveals Mike Chew, CEO, AISATS.</p>
      <p>All stakeholders in the pharma supply chain are making sure that the high-value and temperature-sensitive shipments are taken care of in the best possible manner. This includes ensuring that their staff and handlers are well-trained to handle such sensitive shipments. CEIV and GDP certifications are becoming increasingly important worldwide to prove that transport quality is high. And with client needs and expectations exceeding by the day – there is no possibility for an airport "blackhole", no delays and no more temperature excursions. Shipment visibility and transparency is the key.</p>

      <p>1GSA – the independent general sales and service agents (GSSA) network launched at air cargo europe – has appointed e-Cargoware as its preferred supplier of IT systems, providing all members with access to a GSA management system at preferential rates.</p>
      <p>e-Cargoware is already installed and operational at 1GSA founder member and UK representative, Select Airline Management. Select had been using the system's predecessor since it commenced trading in 2004, and has recently migrated to e-Cargoware.</p>
      <p>M&amp;C Aviation, which was one of the first GSSA companies to join the 1GSA network, covering seven countries in Asia, has also chosen e-Cargoware; it is mid-way through implementation across its branch network.</p>
      <p>e-Cargoware is a state-of-the-art GSSA system with highly-advanced networking features, is web-enabled and cloud-based. Provided as a SaaS (software as a service) solution, it will enable all 1GSA members to interface with each other, and to act as a single unit managed from one location, in cases where airlines wish to appoint multiple 1GSA stations.</p>
      <p>The e-Cargoware system provides a suite of functions, including auto quotations, reservations, flight planning and capacity control, AWB stock management, pre-alerts and manifesting to handlers, and auto post flights.</p>
      <p>It also provides charges calculation, job costing, invoicing, schedule management, CASS settlements processing, sub-GSA management, Cargo-IMP message processing, management reports, customisable CSR reports and track and trace.</p>
      <p>e-Cargoware supports multi-station and multi currency, is e-AWB and e-freight compliant, and uses e-Pouch to store documents electronically. e-Cargoware GSA is one element in a total supply chain solution that can seamlessly link shippers, forwarders, airlines and GSSA, handlers and consignees.</p>
      <p>Using its FR8 Booking web interface, which is mobile-friendly, 1GSA members will be able to provide a customised web-based quotes and booking facility to forwarders, with full background CRM functions that will enhance their business prospecting and promotional capabilities.</p>
      <p>1GSA president, David Lee (above) says: "Our research and personal experience have shown e-Cargoware to be the most advanced GSSA system on offer today. In my own company, Select, it is revolutionising how we work, and definitely strengthens our offering both to forwarders and airlines. It was therefore the obvious choice as the first of our Preferred Suppliers, adding further value to 1GSA membership.</p>
      <p>"The system's web architecture and cloud-based operation, along with its innovative networking features, make it ideal as a uniform platform to support 1GSA's growth. e-Cargoware will enable 1GSA to offer a total cargo management solution to airlines. We will be the first truly digital network GSSA, and this will be a real differentiator, as well as enabling our members to work smarter."</p>
      <p>The 1GSA network covers Bangladesh, the Czech Republic, India, Madagascar, Mauritius, Pakistan, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Turkey and the UK. Members now signed up total six and include Select, CRS, GCAir, Kargo Sistem, and M&amp;C Aviation.</p>

      <p>Shanghai Pharma will partner with DHL Supply Chain to enhance quality control measures, streamline distribution processes, and strengthen compliance with local and international food and pharmaceutical regulations.</p>
      <p>Shanghai Pharma, one of China's largest listed pharmaceuticals groups, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with DHL Supply Chain to prepare its logistics infrastructure for rapid global expansion.</p>
      <p>The pharmaceuticals giant, which generated revenues of more than U$18 billion (RMB121 billion) last year – will partner with DHL Supply Chain on quality, efficiency, compliance and regulations.</p>
      <p>A range of recent government initiatives, including the 'two-invoice' or fapiao policy which was rolled out earlier this year, have put greater onus on China's pharmaceutical sector to improve the transparency and efficiency of local supply chains.</p>
      <p>Shanghai Pharma president and executive director, Cho Man says: "The quality and resilience of our logistics infrastructure will determine not only how successfully we adapt to new legislation like fapiao – which seeks to cut down on multiple distributors and mark-ups by only allowing two invoices per goods shipment, but also our ability to capitalise on the huge international growth opportunity for high-grade Chinese pharmaceutical products and medical devices.</p>
      <p>"China's national market for drugs has grown rapidly in recent years to become the world's second-largest with an estimated growth to around $167 billion by 2020. Our partnership with DHL will help Shanghai Pharma to become one of the world's foremost pharmaceutical manufacturers – supported by a global distribution network that combines world-class quality control with fast, seamless delivery."</p>
      <p>The MOU will grant Shanghai Pharma priority access to DHL's global logistics network including temperature-sensitive life sciences services to Europe. DHL Supply Chain will also support Shanghai Pharma's supply chain optimisation needs as the manufacturer ramps up its overseas distribution and retailing efforts.</p>
      <p>DHL Supply Chain CEO for Greater China, Yin Zou explains: "China's pharmaceutical industry has historically suffered from high levels of fragmentation amongst its local customers and distributors, an issue which recent legislative changes like the 'two-invoice' policy have sought to combat.</p>
      <p>"In this regulatory climate, end-to-end supply chain management plays an increasingly crucial role in determining how effectively Chinese pharmaceuticals firms not only maintain sales locally, but gain traction abroad in a cost-effective and sustainable manner."</p>
      <p>He adds: "We believe that our partnership will not only greatly benefit both parties, but raise the bar for quality control and supply chain efficiency across China's entire pharmaceutical industry."</p>

      <p>Ground services provider Swissport International has opened a new Pharma Center for handling temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical shipments at Brussels Airport.</p>
      <p>The new facility, opened today (October 23), has 3,620 sq m of temperature-controlled warehouse space.</p>
      <p>It incorporates two areas dedicated to the handling of pharmaceutical products. One area, covering 2,620 sq m, is for shipments require to be kept in a temperature range of +15°C to +25°C. This is three times the area formerly available to Swissport at the gateway for keeping cargo in this temperature range.</p>
      <p>Another 1,000 sq m of space is available for cargo to be kept at temperatures in the +2° to +8°C range.</p>
      <p>The facility has eight dedicated truck docks, allowing fully temperature-controlled transfer of containers and pallets to the warehouse.</p>
      <p>Its automated material handling system offers 432 rack and ground positions, castor decks and associated forklifts and pallet movers.</p>
      <p>The facility is said by Swissport to be the company's "most advanced temperature-controlled cargo warehouse globally". It is sited adjacent to the handler's pre-existing air cargo facility in the northwest area of the airport.</p>
      <p>Swissport has signed a 20-year lease contract on the new facility and is investing roughly €11m in interior fittings, including an automated material handling system and cooling systems.</p>
      <p>Luzius Wirth, executive vice president Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa at Swissport International, pointed out: "We can now provide a seamless, high-quality service from the trucks to the aircraft cargo hold.</p>
      <p>"The Swissport Pharma Center at Brussels Airport will play a key role in our growing global network of temperature-controlled warehouses," Wirth added.</p>
      <p>After a construction period of ten months (construction work on the new facility started in January this year), the Swissport Pharma Center represents the first part of a wider refurbishment project for the handler at Brussels Airport, which will come to take in a total of 25,000 square metres of warehouse space in a phased process of development.</p>
      <p>Landside, the completed warehouse will feature 47 truck loading bays in a closed perimeter. Airside, 'speed gates' will facilitate quick and efficient cargo handling.</p>
      <p>The full development project will also include a new four-story office building, to be completed in the autumn of 2020.</p>
      <p>Swissport Belgium currently handles more than 550,000 tons of air cargo a year.</p>

      <p>Cold Chain Technologies (CCT), a Massachusetts-based developer and manufacturer of temperature-sensitive packaging options for the pharmaceutical, biotech, healthcare, clinical trial distribution and medical device industries, has officially launched what it says is "the first solid phase change material (PCM) to maintain the integrity of drugs and vaccines during transport". Said by CCT to be in early use with some "market-leading pharmaceutical manufacturers", the new Koolit Advanced PCM Gel is provides uniform thermal payload protection in a flexible, break-resistant gel pack. "This solution defines the new state-of-the-art for the safe shipment of drugs, vaccines and clinical trials," declared T J Rizzo, CCT's senior vice president, global commercial operations. "Gelled PCM delivers extraordinary temperature control, protection, and efficiency, and it's been a vision of the pharmaceutical packaging industry for some time," he added. Koolit Advanced PCM Gel comes in a solid, uniform pack, thereby providing consistent protection however it is positioned. Moreover, CCT noted, the solid material and break-resistant packaging "virtually eliminate concerns about leakage". Finally, the gel pack benefits from its "modularity" – in other words, it can be used for various package sizes and shapes, and can easily wrap around the corners of a product box. "For the distribution floor, this means operational simplicity and flexibility. For the manufacturer, this means cost savings, as fewer PCMs and containers are needed," a CCT statement observed.

      <p>IATA will be seconding staff to Swiss WorldCargo in a development programme to enhance the association's capabilities in the cargo field and "ensure closer alignment on the key issues facing global cargo".</p>
      <p>During the placement period, the secondee will be exposed to key management functions including revenue management, tracking and tracing, e-commerce activities, operations, security and network management.</p>
      <p>IATA said the initiative aims to build on the past success of the association by facilitating dialogue and progress on agreed industry issues and priorities, and to further global cargo agenda items such as e-Freight and Secure Freight.</p>
      <p>"This initiative is an important part of IATA's efforts to develop its key talent," Des Vertannes, IATA head of global cargo, said. "Our goal is a more reliable, secure, efficient and profitable supply chain through the implementation of industry change programs like e-freight, standard quality performance measures, and relevant standards that support global operations. Better understanding the environment of our members, and the broader supply chain, through first hand experience, is critical to being able to do that effectively."</p>

      <p>TIACA has developed a new online Cargo Service Quality (CSQ) tool to help improve visibility and facilitate global standards across the air cargo supply chain – a step towards providing shippers with the ability to view the quality of service delivered in the air cargo supply chain.</p>
      <p>The initiative was launched at TIACA's 2017 Executive Summit in Miami today, and comes after a year of research undertaken by TIACA board members – led by chairman Sanjiv Edward, head of cargo business at Delhi International Airport, and Cheemeng Wong, senior vice president of cargo services at SATS.</p>
      <p>Other board members backing the CSQ measure include Steven Polmans, head of cargo and logistics at Brussels Airport Company, and Amar More, chief executive officer at Kale Logistics Solutions.</p>
      <p>Edward says: "In my interactions with shippers it has been reaffirmed that the lack of visibility and absence of uniform global standards results in air freight business deals being limited by cost considerations, lack of product improvements, and perceived lack of value for money."</p>
      <p>"The CSQ initiative is a logical step for an association like TIACA, that integrates all the players of the air cargo supply chain," explains TIACA secretary general, Vladimir Zubkov.</p>
      <p>"This initiative will play a key role in standardising cargo quality assessment globally, establishing new benchmark parameters, identifying strength and improvement areas, optimizing investments, and sharing best practice in the industry," says Wong.</p>
      <p>Participants will be able to fill out an online 'Cargo Quality Assessment Form' either every quarter, or every six months, and will have access to a customised 'Quality Dashboard'.</p>
      <p>Key benefits of taking part include gap analyses in order to identify strength and improvement areas, and best practice sharing.</p>
      <p>Polmans says: "It will challenge companies that are underperforming and those that are overperforming."</p>
      <p>The pilot phase of the program includes assessment tools for airports and cargo terminal operators, and the CSQ will eventually be available to measure other segments of the air cargo supply chain.</p>
      <p>The program has received backing from players at leading airports including Hong Kong International Airport, Singapore Changi Airport, New Delhi Airport, Brussels Airport, and Beijing Capital Airport.</p>
      <p>Over 300 industry leaders from across the globe are attending TIACA's Executive Summit in partnership with the 14th Annual End-to-End Supply Network Summit.</p>

      <p>RIOgaleão Cargo has been awarded the International Air Transport Association's (IATA)  Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Pharma certificate.</p>
      <p>The freight arm of Rio de Janeiro International Airport becomes the first hub in Latin America to gain CEIV and it says it confirms it as one of the leading gateways for pharmaceutical products in the region.</p>
      <p>CEIV Pharma certification confirms compliance with the highest international pharma handling standards and best practices and significantly reduces logistics costs and risks for the airport's clients.</p>
      <p>The certification comes after the inauguration in 2016 of the airports 'TECA Pharma 2' facility, which tripled cold storage capacity to 17,000 square metres at the cargo terminal, offering 1,400 additional pallet positions.</p>
      <p>The facility features a fully automated cargo storage system and comprises two temperature environments (+2° to +8° and +16° to +22° degrees Celsius) as well temperature controlled anterooms and docks.</p>
      <p>Approximately 25 per cent of RIOgaleão Cargo's revenues are related to temperature controlled pharmaceutical freight and the hub is the country's main gateway for government vaccination initiatives.</p>
      <p>RIOgaleão Cargo director, Patrick Fehring says: "Airfreight provides the pharmaceutical industry with the speed and efficiency high value and temperature sensitive products require.</p>
      <p>"Our CEIV Pharma certification demonstrates to our customers that we operate to the highest international standards and it gives us a strong competitive advantage over other airports in the region.</p>
      <p>"Together with our airport and airline partners we can now offer our pharmaceutical customers a CEIV Pharma certified trade lane, giving them peace of mind from origin to destination."</p>
      <p>IATA's director in Brazil, Carlos Ebner adds: "Air transport, nowadays, requires special capabilities for the handling of pharmaceuticals. CEIV Pharma is a program that seeks to implement international standards of supply chain management, addressing chain challenges, including the latest achievements in the transportation of pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>'The program is proof that the air transport industry is truly committed to its challenges and we are very proud of RIOgaleão's CEIV Pharma certification."</p>

      <p>Brussels Airport Company will invest €100 million over three years in ultra modern logistics buildings to strengthen its position as a vital logistics cluster in Belgium.</p>
      <p>The buildings will cover 50,000m2 on the West side of Brucargo with direct apron connection for four different companies, with Kuehne + Nagel, dnata and WFS among the companies making use of these buildings for shipping, packaging and stocking cargo.</p>
      <p>The new infrastructure will be specifically suited for the handling of high-quality and temperature sensitive products including pharmaceuticals, products which are important to Brussels Airport and Belgium as a whole.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport will also redevelop existing handling buildings that have direct access to the tarmac, with the building Swissport is active in being systematically transformed into a modern and energy efficient storage and office space with a surface area of 30,000m2.</p>
      <p>An additional new building will provide a secured area for the specific transport of extremely valuable goods, with Brinks moving into this building in 2019.</p>
      <p>Part of the investment will go to an exclusive animal border inspection area of more than 2,500m2, fitted out in various temperature and/or light areas to create the perfect environment for all types of animals.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport head of cargo and logistics, Steven Polmans says: "It is our ambition to remain an import cargo hub in future and strengthen the position of BRUcargo as an efficient and important logistical platform.</p>
      <p>"In recent years we have proven our commitment to cargo and we reconfirmed this in our Strategic Vision 2040 launched last year. This investment is another step in realising this ambition together with all our stakeholders and customers."</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport Company chief executive officer, Arnaud Feist adds: "These investments are of huge importance for the logistics landscape in Belgium and are entirely in line with our Strategic Vision for 2040.</p>
      <p>"With these investments, Brussels Airport will remain in the future a crucial hub for air transport and the logistic chains in Europe, at the service of many hundreds of companies in our country."</p>

    <content>
      <p>The WCA's IT platform WIN, which connects forwarders to over 90 airlines, is to offer free e-Air Waybills (eAWBs) to its members for the rest of 2016.</p>
      <p>The move is part of package designed to induce more forwarders to connect to the system.</p>
      <p>WIN previously charged $1 per eAWB, and the impact of the new free regime would be immediate for forwarders – other platforms tend to charge forwarders $1.75-$3.50 per eAWB while airlines offer fee reductions for filing eAWBs due to the increase in efficiencies.</p>
      <p>US airlines commonly charge $25 per paper AWB.</p>
      <p>WIN managing director John DeBenedette said the advantages went far beyond the purely financial.</p>
      <p>"The real benefit is the real-time tracking of cargo that the system provides.</p>
      <p>"Independents can act now to gain the same level of efficiencies already enjoyed by multinational forwarders and tap into the growing trend of airport fast-lanes for cargo tendered with electronic data in advance."</p>
      <p>Mr DeBenedette said the biggest challenge in seeing the system adopted across the WCA network was "getting the software companies in 180 countries to do a one-time connection to WIN".</p>
      <p>"But what WIN does is bridge dissimilar systems around the world and keeps them completely in sync. If you are connected to the system and tracking a shipment through it; when an airline updates information about it, or a member in another country inputs data about it, it is automatically update on your system," he explained.</p>
      <p>Mitch Kamdar, director of US-based WCA member Worldwide Logistics Partners, told The Loadstar that the system had allowed his company transform itself from a straightforward air and sea freight forwarder to something approaching a global logistics provider – thanks to the increased connectivity and visibility it now has with its WCA partners across the globe.</p>
      <p>"With our WCA partnerships we are able to offer global end-to-end supply chain solutions, and we have invested in the WCA's WIN system, which means we have the same IT capabilities that the large multinationals have," he said.</p>
      <p>Dan March, WCA chief executive, added: "For our members, going electronic is not just about eliminating paper or helping airlines increase their efficiency which is all well and good, but equally important it's about benefiting from the real-time shipment visibility, system integration, and member collaboration features that we've also built into WIN."</p>
      <p>The development today was also welcomed by Glyn Hughes, IATA's global head of cargo.</p>
      <p>"I applaud WCA's leadership for supporting air cargo's drive to go paperless. Air cargo needs to upgrade its value proposition as shipper expectations become ever more demanding and paper-based solutions just can't deliver the quality, transparency and predictability that is required."</p>
      <p>The WIN eAWBs are also available to non-WCA members, although they will continue to be subject to the $1 per booking fee, and Mr March revealed that a couple of multinational forwarders have also signed up to the system.</p>
      <p>"It is not the whole multinational but rather some offices in particular countries which haven't yet been connected up to their respective corporate systems, but urgently need to be filing eAWBs," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are at a tipping point with the level of e-AWB adoption in the industry approaching the halfway mark," Mr DeBenedette added.</p>

      <p>Turkish Cargo, the airfreight arm of Turkish Airlines, has been awarded IATA's 'Center of Excellence for Independent Validators' (CEIV) certification for pharmaceutical logistics at its Istanbul hub. The carrier has also trained a dedicated team to preserve the integrity of the cold chain and products and will introduce a thermal dolly service to protect shipments from the heat on the tarmac at Istanbul Atatürk airport. Turkish Cargo has 3000sq m of storage area at Atatürk covering four different temperature ranges (from -20 °C to +25 °C) with healthcare products stored in a dedicated 1030sq m area. Temperatures are monitored by telemetry, and all cargo movements are tracked with COMIS, Turkish Cargo's IT software, in real time. IATA established the Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) in Pharmaceutical Logistics to help companies from the entire air cargo supply chain achieve excellence in their pharmaceutical handling operations. The carrier's senior vice president cargo, Şeref Kazancı, said: "Transportation of pharmaceuticals and healthcare products is a priority for Turkish Cargo. As we continue to expand our operations in this area, we remain committed to ensuring that we are operating to the highest possible quality standards. "Achieving IATA CEIV Pharma certification means that our customers can have the confidence that their sensitive cargo will be handled – at every stage in the process – in accordance with the very best practices." IATA's head of cargo, Glyn Hughes, added: "With the airline group's commitment to investing in its workforce, state-of-the-art facilities, innovative products and certifications, Turkish Cargo's customers can be confident that their life-saving and temperature sensitive products will be delivered in impeccable condition." </p>

      <p>After almost two years of development, the completely automatic warehouse inventory solution using drones, perfected by Geodis and Delta Drone, will be operational at the end of 2018.</p>
      <p>More than 1,000 flight hours in prototype mode across three pilot warehouses were required to arrive at this unique solution, which allows companies to perform completely automatic warehouse inventories without interrupting their usual operations or requiring any human intervention. The main advantages of this solution are the productivity gains generated by performing the inventories outside warehouse operating hours, greater safety at work for the site's employees, who no longer have to carry out this tedious and sometimes risky task and a greater reliability of the inventory.</p>
      <p>In the prototyping phase, multiple tests were carried out in real operating conditions in order to meet the specific constraints of warehouses, such as low light or the impact that the plastic film covering pallets has on image capturing, which required special adaptations to the cameras embedded in the drones.</p>
      <p>This phase ended in 2017 with the development of a complete "plug and play" solution that can be easily moved from one warehouse to another without requiring that any prior changes be made to the warehouse. This solution also adapts to all types of Warehouse Management Systems (WMS).</p>
      <p>Based on these extremely positive results, Geodis and Delta Drone are now working on producing a system that can be manufactured, focusing their attention on the solution's design and the final choice of the best components. The aim is to move to the industrial production stage at the end of the year. Initially, Geodis will be the exclusive user of this solution in its own warehouses.</p>
      <p>The solution combines a ground-based robot and a quadcopter drone equipped with four high-definition cameras.</p>
      <p>This set, equipped with indoor geolocation technology, operates autonomously during the hours the site is closed. From an IT point of view, the solution enables the counting and reporting of data in real time, the processing of data, and its restitution in the warehouse's information system. The tests conducted during this initial development phase show that the solution enables inventory to be managed reliably with rates close to 100 per cent.</p>

      <p>Emirates SkyCargo, the freight division of Emirates, has beefed up its commitments to securely transport temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical shipments through its recently opened pharma corridors that offers additional protection across selected stations in its network.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Emirates SkyCargo is working with ground handling partners and other stakeholders at multiple cities across its global network to ensure that handling operations for pharmaceuticals at various stations are uniform and comply with the Emirates SkyCargo's stringent norms for pharma transport, as well as EU Good Distribution Practices (GDP) or IATA Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) pharma guidelines.</p>
      <p>This is expected to enable Emirates SkyCargo to offer a supplementary protection of product integrity during transport of temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical cargo through these cities.</p>
      <p>Delivering Life-saving Medicine through Emirates SkyCargo</p>
      <p>During 2016, Emirates SkyCargo's operations at its hub in Dubai, including its dual cargo terminals at the Dubai International Airport, Dubai World Central and the interconnecting trucking operations were certified as compliant to EU GDP guidelines by Bureau Veritas, Germany.</p>
      <p>Operating the largest GDP certified multi-airport hub in the world, Emirates SkyCargo offers round-the-year secure transportation of pharmaceutical cargo at its hub in Dubai. The introduction of pharma corridors with a focus on non-hub handling activities allows it to go one step further for the protection for pharma cargo.</p>
      <p>Nabil Sultan, divisional senior vice president cargo of Emirates said: "As a customer-focused organisation, we received feedback from stakeholders in the global pharmaceutical industry. We realised that it was essential to work with our partners on the ground at the various stations in order to ensure the pharmaceutical cargo is transported under the best conditions, not only through our state-of-the-art facilities in Dubai when onboard our modern aircraft, but right from the point the cargo gets dropped off at the origin airport until it is collected at the destination airport. We are also actively exploring the rollout of dedicated pharma flights across our network. Emirates SkyCargo is constantly striving to offer the best solutions for our customers."</p>
      <p>The first 12 stations in Emirates SkyCargo's pharma corridors are spread across three continents, which include Amsterdam, Brussels, Bengaluru, Cairo, Dublin, Dusseldorf, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Milan, Rome, Shanghai and Singapore.</p>
      <p>The rollout of pharma corridors was led by pharma specialists in the Emirates SkyCargo team working in coordination with cargo service delivery teams and ground handlers locally at stations.</p>
      <p>In addition to enhanced training provided to staff handling pharmaceutical cargo at the stations, the team also undertook a number of engagement and qualification visits in order to prepare for the rollout. Additional cities are expected to be added over the course of the year.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo's pharma corridors is expected to enhance Emirates Pharma air transportation solution. The air cargo carrier has also invested in developing white cover thermal blankets in addition to innovative containers, such as the Emirates SkyCargo cool dolly or the white container to guarantee that lifesaving medicines travelling through its network are not compromised.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has a fleet strength of over 50 cool dollies dedicated to pharma cargo. The carrier also works with leading container rental services across the globe to ensure that customers have the widest choice of products and solutions to meet their requirements.  It operates to over 155 destinations across six continents and operates a fleet of over 265 aircraft including 14 freighters.</p>

      <p>The recent surge in demand for air cargo services is putting the squeeze on Brussels Airport (BRU), so it is investing €100 million in expanding its cargo facilities.</p>
      <p>The expansion of the cargo processing area, called BRUcargo, is part of a continuing effort to accommodate freight forwarders, like Kuehne + Nagel, as well as ground handlers, such as Swissport Cargo Services and Dnata.</p>
      <p>In 2016, the airport made known its intent to invest further in cargo by forming a cargo community organization, called Air Cargo Belgium, and defining objectives to further expand its cargo department in its Strategic Vision 2040 plan.</p>
      <p>The 50,000-square-meter "ultramodern logistics buildings" will have direct apron connections for four different carriers, and will be used for shipping and packaging, as well as temporary storage for high-quality, temperature-sensitive products, like pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>In addition to the new buildings, BRU also intends to make some renovations — transforming existing handling buildings into energy-efficient storage facilities and office spaces.</p>

      <p>SHANGHAI – IATA and the city of Shanghai, China, are partnering on an initiative to help stamp out cumbersome paper processes in the logistics industry.</p>
      <p>On March 10, during IATA's World Cargo Symposium, the organization announced that it had signed a "letter of initiative" to promote e-freight efforts jointly with Shanghai Customs, Shanghai Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau, Shanghai Airport Authority, China Eastern Airlines and Shanghai E-port.</p>
      <p>Under the terms of the agreement, the six organizations said they will cooperate to phase out the need for a security check stamp on paper air waybills (AWB). The groups will also work toward eliminating the need for paper AWB and facilitate the implementation of paperless customs clearance at Shanghai Pudong Airport by optimizing and streamlining data sharing between the parties</p>
      <p>"China is the second-largest market for international freight by air. With much of the world's manufacturing taking place in China, it is essential that processes are kept as efficient as possible," said Zhang Baojian, IATA's regional vice president for North Asia. "This can be achieved through partnership and adoption of global standards. This agreement will bolster Shanghai's position as a leading airfreight hub in China and in the world."</p>
      <p>The air cargo industry is well-known for its paper-intensive processes. E-freight is a global initiative to modernize the air cargo industry and enhance efficiency by eliminating the pouch of more than 20 documents that accompany every air cargo shipment.</p>
      <p>IATA's target is to achieve 45 percent e-AWB penetration globally by the end of 2015, and 80 percent by the end of 2016. At the end of 2014, the penetration rate was 24.9 percent.</p>
      <p>E-freight pilots have been implemented at Shanghai Pudong Airport, Guangzhou Baiyun Airport and Beijing Capital Airport. In June 2014, China Cargo Airlines successfully launched the pilot e-AWB pilot at Shanghai Pudong Airport. To date, Shanghai is the leading airport in China in terms of the number of e-AWBs processed.</p>
      <p>Shanghai Pudong Airport ranks third globally for cargo handled and is the gateway for more than 60 percent of China's cargo throughput. In 2014, Shanghai Pudong Airport saw an 8 percent increase in its cargo throughput.</p>
      <p>The e-freight initiative was tied to an announcement from IATA on the same day, calling for further action on three vital aspects of the air cargo business: transitioning to paperless freight processes, focusing on global handling standards for pharmaceutical freight and taking tougher action to ensure the continued safe transportation of lithium batteries by air.</p>
      <p>"We still have work to do to help businesses transition, but there has been a big change in the mentality of the industry," said Tony Tyler, IATA's Director General and CEO.</p>

      <p>Improvements in meteorological forecasting have opened a "critical window" for supply chains to mitigate risks posed by weather phenomena including cyclones and hurricanes.</p>
      <p>Forecasts for the 2019 hurricane season indicate a "below-average" number are expected to hit North America, with DHL's cloud-based risk management system Resilience360 putting this down to cooler ocean temperatures.</p>
      <p>Citing scientists at Colorado State University, the system is predicting five hurricanes during this year's season, which runs from June to November, peaking in September.</p>
      <p>While other forecasters have put the number at seven, chief executive of Resilience360 Tobias Larsson said it is important to remember that even a minor hurricane affecting a small region can "prove disastrous" for supply chains.</p>
      <p>"Despite increasing complexity of supply chains, advanced technologies allow us to map out multi-tiered supply chains, including interdependencies up and down stream," he said.</p>
      <p>"This makes it possible to understand how changes at one node – such as cargo ships stranded at a port – could impact the entire supply chain and when businesses are able to visualise where problems could arise, they can also plan appropriately."</p>
      <p>Mr Larsson added "preparedness is key", noting that with greater timeframes in which to plan, supply chains can reroute and find back-up suppliers for areas due to be hit by storms.</p>
      <p>Alongside short-term measures, he said in the longer-term visibility tools, diversifying the company's network, and establishing long-term partnerships with logistics suppliers can strongly influence how seriously a supply chain is affected by a hurricane.</p>
      <p>Last year, US ports lost a total of 35 days' container port activity as a result of tropical storms, with typhoons causing the closure of four Chinese and one Japanese air freight hub.</p>
      <p>And while the US may be facing a relatively calm hurricane season, for East Asia, 2019 has already represented a record storm season, with expectations of 17 typhoons more than 10 of which are expected to be high-strength.</p>
      <p>"Even before the season officially started, two records have already been broken," stated Resilience360's latest report.</p>
      <p>"Pabuk, the season's first named storm, became the earliest-forming tropical storm of the Western Pacific Ocean on record, while Wutip, the season's first typhoon, became the strongest tropical storm recorded in February in the Northern Hemisphere."</p>
      <p>Among industries expected to be hit in East Asia by this season's storms are automotive, electronics, and engineering supply chain locations in China's Pearl River Delta.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the report warned that most common trajectories for typhoons take in Shanghai and south west Japan, with industries in these regions likely facing secondary impacts of storms such as flooding and power outages.</p>
      <p>"Established national and regional meteorological agencies regularly provide forecasts and timely alerts on developing storms," added the report.</p>
      <p>"Supply chain managers can receive advanced warnings to proactively initiate mitigation plans ahead of a storm's arrival, monitoring weather alerts also allows ample time to assess potential impact areas, align with suppliers, plan productions, and schedule shipments."</p>

      <p>Air Cargo News' Life Sciences and Pharmaceuticals Air Cargo Conference has again attracted a top level line-up of industry speakers to debate issues affecting the international supply chain. Conference programme: click here… Hear from: Five of the world's leading pharmaceutical manufacturers Three of the world's leading temperature-controlled solution providers Three of the world's largest airlines Two of the world's leading forwarders on how they have implemented Good Distribution Practice (GDP) into their businesses Plus, there will be speakers from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UKMHRA), IATA and the latest news from the temperature-monitoring technology sector. With ample time for healthy and constructive debate, this conference provides an unrivalled opportunity for practical learning in the field of GDP and how the industry needs to collaborate constantly for success. Senior representatives from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), AstraZeneca and Napp Pharma will speak at the conference. Stephen Mitchell, Compliance and Quality Manager at GSK, will open the conference with an industry-related viewpoint on the aspects of visibility, harmonization and performance that manufacturers expect from their supply chain. Tom Grubb, Manager, Cold Chain Strategy, American Airlines will continue the collaboration theme by showing how air cargo can really deliver to the user in a presentation with a theme of 'real drugs for real patients'. The pharmaceutical sector will speak about the value of 'GDP Certified' supply chain services offered by forwarders and airlines and whether differential pricing can be justified, whilst David Beecham of Qatar Airways – on of the world's fastest growing cargo carriers – will consider whether there is any greater value in being GDP certified as opposed to 'GDP Compliant' GDP inspector Cheryl Blake will address how the UKMHRA has been monitoring the aspect of GDP compliance within the UK logistics sector and will present the latest views on how the audits of transportation providers have been progressing. From the forwarders perspective, Andrew Lester, Global Director of Healthcare at Expeditors, and Sarina Walidin, Compliance Manager, IJS Global, will present and then discuss with the audience how GDP was implemented into their businesses. Julian Wann of AstraZeneca, who spoke at last year's event and challenged the air logistics industry to improve or to risk losing more traffic to seafreight, will give his views on the latest issues affecting modal shift. What has changed in the last 12 months? In response to this, Glyn Hughes, Head of Cargo at IATA will look at how 'air cargo' is fighting back, while Soufiane Daher of the Seabury Group will provide the latest update on how the sector is performing. On Day Two, the issue of choosing packaging and logistics solutions that offer temperature control and address the aspect sustainability will be addressed and will challenge the solutions industry. Responding to this will be the chief executives from three of the world's most important providers: Simon Angeldorff from Envirotainer, Brian Kohr of CSafe and David Walsh of DGP Intelsius. The importance of good communication and collaboration in end-to-end temperature management is highlighted in a presentation by Alan Dorling, Head of Life Sciences, IAG Cargo, which looks at the roles of the shipper, forwarder and ground handler Supply Chain Security and how the logistics sector can improve its compliance with the EU Falsified Medicines Directive will be discussed by Henry Moran – UK and International Supplies, Napp Pharmaceutical Group.

      <p>2019 has started on a good note for Etihad Cargo as it becomes the first Middle Eastern carrier to be awarded IATA's Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) certification in Pharmaceutical Logistics.</p>
      <p>Also, the Abu-Dhabi based airline is one of only 16 carriers to hold this important certification worldwide.</p>
      <p>The certifications cover both the airline operations of Etihad Cargo, as well as cargo handling and warehousing at its hub in Abu Dhabi International Airport. Etihad's cargo handling subsidiary Etihad Airport Services LLC has also been awarded the CEIV Pharma certification.</p>
      <p>Abdulla Mohamed Shadid, managing director Cargo and Logistics at Etihad Aviation Group, said: "Since we launched our refreshed strategy in early 2018, a lot of focus has gone towards enhancing our premium product verticals and offering the highest quality and reliability standards to our customers. Today our TempCheck product receives a major boost with this important certification."</p>
      <p>The carrier has undergone a major enhancement program to its facilities, systems and processes to meet the stringent standards that CEIV Pharma demands, which combines IATA's Temperature Control Regulations, GDP best practices, and other international benchmarks. These enhancements include the planned use of cool dollies at Abu Dhabi International Airport, thermal blankets both in Abu Dhabi and at key stations globally, and a tie up with additional active container suppliers to expand the options of temperature-controlled containers across its global network, among other initiatives.</p>
      <p>Some other enhancements include commencement of a major expansion and refurbishment program to its cargo terminal at Abu Dhabi International Airport in the fourth quarter of 2018, which aims to add additional temperature-controlled space to its existing pharma zone by 2020, in addition to a dedicated staging facility at its Midfield complex in time for the airline's move to the new state-of-the-art terminal.</p>
      <p>Shadid added: "We redefined our freighter fleet strategy focusing on the Boeing 777 freighter, as well as a new and refreshed freighter network adding key capacity on core trade lanes. We also recently launched two new products, FlightValet and FreshForward, both of which have seen remarkable successes, and in October we completed our digital migration to the leading iCargo technology platform."</p>

      <p>Cargo iQ has launched an 'Air Cargo Intelligence Hub' giving members real-time access to data for the first time.</p>
      <p>It was detailed at its Commercial Summit in Geneva, where the IATA interest group also revealed a new Sales Toolkit, including a short animated film (above) outlining the value of the organization.</p>
      <p>The Hub allows members to search their Cargo iQ data by route, milestone, station, product, customer, or provider, enabling them to develop new products, improve processes, and drive quality in the air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>The online self-service access gives members real-time information on performance for the first time, enabling them to develop new products and improve processes.</p>
      <p>The 'Air Cargo Intelligence Hub' gives members access to their data on any given route and produces customised reports, allowing them to compare their own performance against Cargo iQ standards, and that of the Cargo iQ community overall.</p>
      <p>Cargo iQ members work with shared shipment planning called route maps, based on its Master Operating Plan (MOP), which measures each individual cargo journey from shipper to consignee against 16 milestones.</p>
      <p>Through analysis of the data generated by these measurements, members can work with their customers and suppliers to improve performance, develop new products, and drive quality in the air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>Cargo iQ executive director, Ariaen Zimmerman says: "Our members can now analyze their data and see it in an easy to understand, meaningful way; giving them the tools to focus their resources to where they need to improve processes, and supporting them to optimize their products and requirements both for their industry partners and of course, our customers, the shippers.</p>
      <p>"Cargo iQ members are focused on quality in the air cargo industry and our new Hub will help demonstrate the value that air freight brings to the global logistics market.</p>
      <p>"Members will be better able to explain to current and potential customers exactly what it is they are paying for, and offer them a choice of products – something new and refreshing for the somewhat traditional air freight sector."</p>
      <p>Delegates were joined by Global Shippers' Forum (GSF) head of global policy, Alex Veitch who brought a customer perspective to the debate.</p>
      <p>Cargo iQ chairman and DHL Global Forwarding senior vice president and global head of network carrier management, Henk Venema says: "Cargo iQ members continue to innovate and make quality the focal point of the air cargo industry, collaborating to improve airfreight, and using Smart Data to optimise their products.</p>
      <p>"Our work with shippers shows the need to have timely and clear information shared and our members understand that better than anyone.</p>
      <p>"Cargo iQ will take part in GSF's next meeting in preparation of a joint launch of the industry's first shipper KPIs later this year, marking another important milestone for our industry."</p>
      <p>The Hub is one of a series of initiatives aimed at improving the value Cargo iQ delivers to its members and to the industry as a whole, which has included the appointment of independent auditors.</p>

      <p>A second Good Distribution Practice (GDP) academy training course organised by IAG Cargo and Exelsius was attended by students from the UK, the Netherlands, Korea and Switzerland. Aimed at improving industry compliance to GDP standards for healthcare and life science products, the two-day course offered a combination of classroom training and an airport airside visit to the IAG Cargo Constant Climate Centre. Participants included freight forwarders, logistic service providers, training organisations and ground handling companies, with students awarded a certificate of completion to the required GDP standard.  Tony Wright, chief executive of Exelsius, commented: "The course programme was designed to provide students with an understanding of the compliance needs of GDP from a truly end–to-end perspective and uses many interactive methods of teaching." One participant was Andrew Taylor, operations development manager EMEA at PDP Couriers, who commented: "An excellent overview of how GDP impacts and how it should be applied within the airfreight environment." With the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency requiring all those handling temperature-sensitive healthcare products to obtain a Wholesale Dealers Authorisation, Tony Roberts, UK &amp; Ireland GM cargo operational services at Swissport, also found it particularly useful: "Great lessons, well presented and resulting in lots learnt." IAG Cargo and Exelsius expect to extend the GDP academy, with further courses planned for India, the UK and Europe. Alan Dorling, global head of pharmaceutical and life sciences at IAG Cargo, said: "I am delighted that all delegates found the unique course enhanced their understanding of GDP and the standards required throughout the end-to-end supply chain to achieve certification."

      <p>To prepare for an expected increase in pharmaceutical and high-tech air cargo traffic in the Southeast Asian region, DHL Supply Chain has opened a new logistics center in Singapore that the company said will improve the efficiency of its current operations by 20 percent. The design, DHL said, will be considered a model for its future expansions in densely settled urban areas.</p>
      <p>Called the Advanced Regional Center (ARC), the new 90,000-square-foot Singapore facility features advanced robotics and increased the warehousing footprint on the island nation by 40 percent. DHL will use 130 robotic shuttles to retrieve and store products from up to 72,000 locations arranged in 26 levels.</p>
      <p>"We see the Asian region as a swift adopter of technologies for enhanced productivity and efficiency," said Frank Appel, CEO of Deutsche Post DHL Group. "By 2020, Asia will constitute 30 percent of our total revenue." Facilities like the ARC, he added, will help DHL reduce complexity, while it improves accuracy and productivity.</p>
      <p>In addition, the ARC includes "clean rooms" for the storage and handling of life sciences and healthcare-related shipments. There will also be specialized infrastructure for aerospace operations and customizable storage options for various high-tech customers.</p>
      <p>DHL's move comes a few months after Kuehne + Nagel opened its own pharma-friendly facility in January – a 164,000-square-foot logistics hub in west Singapore, located near the country's pharmaceutical and healthcare centers. The new facility, K+N said, will be large enough to serve its clients across the ASEAN countries.</p>

      <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) say IATA's Cargo-XML messaging standard has now been fully integrated into ASYCUDAWorld.</p>
      <p>The integration of Cargo-XML in ASYCUDAWorld – the UNCTAD automated customs management system used by 90 countries for customs procedures – standardises the electronic communications between airlines and customs authorities using the program.</p>
      <p>The new data standard reduces message duplication and simplifies communication across the supply chain facilitating trade growth, improving cargo security, modernising customs operations and fostering participation in global commerce through advance electronic data submission for air cargo shipments.</p>
      <p>Cargo-XML makes it easier for airlines, freight forwarders and shippers to ensure that the information being provided to the customs authorities is technically correct and in line with standards of industry bodies such as the World Customs Organization (WCO) and regulators. It also facilitates custom risk assessments for air cargo shipments and improves compliance with security regulations.</p>
      <p>IATA's head of cargo, Glyn Hughes says: "Having a standard air cargo digital messaging system between customs authorities, airlines and other air cargo stakeholders is fundamental to enhancing efficiency, driving trade growth and maximizing safety and security across the industry.</p>
      <p>"IATA's successful partnership with UNCTAD means that airlines, freight forwarders, shippers and border agencies in over 90 countries can now talk the same digital language. It takes the industry one step closer to achieving the global adoption of a standard air cargo messaging system."</p>
      <p>UNCTAD's director of division on technology and logistics, Shamika Sirimanne adds: "Considering the complexity of trade flows, increasing demands on advance risk assessments and operational efficiency, electronic data interchange is an integral component of customs modernisation programs.</p>
      <p>"We're delighted to support IATA Cargo-XML standards in the ASYCUDA system, which ultimately will help trade efficiency, improve custom clearance and enhance security through risk assessment procedures."</p>

      <p>TIACA and Air Cargo Belgium, the community organisation at Brussels Airport, are holding a masterclass next month on how the air cargo supply chain can leverage digital transformation and data sharing as enablers for growth. The two-day 'Connected Air Cargo Masterclass' will feature important debates, including building a connected air cargo community, using technology as an enabler, and digital transformation best practice. It will take place at BRUcargo's Air Cargo Academy in Brussels on January 30- 31, 2019. The masterclass will also include a seminar on the story of BRUcloud, an open data sharing platform that enables the different stakeholders to work more "integrated" and act as a network. "We are living in a period of great change for the airfreight industry, and it is imperative that supply chain professionals learn how to take advantage of emerging technologies and trends, as well as explore new ways of collaborating," said Steven Polmans, vice chairman, TIACA, and head of cargo and logistics at Brussels Airport Co. "Attendees have the option of attending an additional session, 'From theory to practice, getting started with collaborative apps', which looks at how to put theory into practice and even includes live demonstrations, when it takes place on February 1." For further information on attending the masterclass and to contact the organisers, visit aircargomasterclass.com.</p>

      <p>DHL Global Forwarding's stations in Frankfurt and Hamburg have gained IATA CEIV Pharma certification, following approval in Leipzig in April 2017.</p>
      <p>DHL started to certify its global stations according to International Air Transport Association (IATA) Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) in Pharmaceutical Logistics in the third quarter of 2016, with around 30 locations running through an independent auditing process including courses for employees in the first phase.</p>
      <p>IATA examines the station's correspondence to Temperature Control Regulations, Good Distribution Practice guidelines of the European Union, the Annex 5 of the World Health Organization and the United States Pharmacopeia Standards.</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding vice president of airfreight in Germany, Thilo Specht says: "Time critical and temperature sensitive pharmaceutical products require the highest quality standards in terms of warehousing, transportation and handling. To achieve this, standardised processes and a compliant, well-orchestrated network are mandatory."</p>
      <p>"Seeing Frankfurt and Hamburg extending our global network on stations certified according the IATA CEIV Pharma Standard is a great achievement giving a strong signal in terms of quality and reliability towards our customers."</p>
      <p>The DHL Thermonet Station in Leipzig was the first German station in the network to receive the quality label in April 2017, followed by Frankfurt and Hamburg, enhancing its transportation and storage quality levels of pharmaceutical goods and exceeds common quality standards in the DHL Air Thermonet stations.</p>
      <p>DHL's IT platform, LifeTrack offers transparency for temperature controlled shipments, ensuring it is not only tracked but also enables intervention if necessary during the supply process around the clock 365 days a year.</p>

      <p>American Airlines Cargo has completed the first phase of its largest investment with the role out of its management system.</p>
      <p>The system replaces the majority of legacy technology, narrowing 90 systems down to less than 10, upgrading customer experience and modernising the business.</p>
      <p>The transition affects more than 8,000 team members and more than 30,000 customers.</p>
      <p>A team of more than 700 people across 300 locations and more than 150 business, technology and vendor partners at the new headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas supported the implementation process.</p>
      <p>The initiative has been led by vice president strategy and development Jessica Tyler, and her team have been united in a people-first philosophy.</p>
      <p>Tyler says: "The technology changes are complex and massive, but the work to support people through this kind of journey is just as complex and has been a priority for us. While standing up the new system has been a huge accomplishment, I'm most proud of our people. Even with the challenges of a project this size, we continue to have a 'bring it on' attitude and remain focused on moving forward. The way the team cares for one another is what makes us uniquely ready for change."</p>
      <p>The system is powered by the IBS Software's iCargo platform, which improves sales, operations, customer experience and accounting, allowing for more efficient online channels, better tracking, greater warehouse efficiency and a robust back-end system.</p>
      <p>Philip Scaria, program manager for IBS Software says: "The scale and size of the American Airlines Cargo enterprise challenged us to dig deep into our experience and skills to lead this implementation. The commitment of team members across the globe and their willingness to embrace change has made all the difference."</p>

      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has transported over 25 tonnes of vaccines from Milan to BH airport, Bello Horizonte in Brazil on its Boeing 777 freighter aircraft.</p>
      <p>This is the largest shipment of vaccines that the carrier has transported on a single flight and it is also the first time that BH Airport has received such a large shipment of vaccines.</p>
      <p>The entire shipment, equivalent to about 1.8 million doses, had to be transported in specialised containers to maintain a constant temperature of 5 degrees C.</p>
      <p>A total of 36 Envirotainer containers - 35 RAP e2 and 1 RKNe1 containers - were loaded on the freighter at Milan, one of the designated airports in Emirates SkyCargo's pharma corridor programme, which aims to provide supplementary protection for pharma product integrity during air transport.</p>
      <p>On arrival at BH Airport, the vaccines were removed from the containers and transported to the temperature controlled storage areas of the airport.</p>
      <p>"Emirates SkyCargo is a global leader in the air transport of temperature sensitive pharmaceuticals and our commitment to transport lifesaving medications securely is backed by our infrastructure including modern aircraft as well as our GDP compliant processes and our trained staff," said Hiran Perera, senior vice president, Cargo Planning &amp; Freighters, Emirates.</p>
      <p>"We planned every detail of this charter very carefully with our partners from mid-July to ensure that the vaccines would be delivered carefully to Belo Horizonte airport," he added.</p>
      <p>"Negotiations for the arrival of this shipment included the visit of technical professionals who checked the storage conditions of our chambers considered to be the latest generation," said Peter Robbe, Belo Horizonte Airport Cargo manager.</p>
      <p>"To take advantage of the potential of the cargo logistics area of the Airport, BH Airport has invested in a new configuration of the Cargo Terminal and has installed two new refrigerated chambers to triple cool chain storage capacity to 3,350 m³," he commented.</p>

      <p>TIACA has teamed up with Air Cargo Belgium, the community organisation at Brussels Airport to hold a masterclass next month exploring how the air cargo supply chain can leverage digital transformation and data sharing as enablers for growth.</p>
      <p>The 'Connected Air Cargo Masterclass' will feature important debates including building a connected air cargo community, using technology as an enabler, and digital transformation best practice, when it takes place at BRUcargo's Air Cargo Academy in Brussels, Belgium, from January 30 to 31.</p>
      <p>The Masterclass will also include a seminar on the story of BRUcloud, an open data sharing platform that enables the different stakeholders to work more "integrated" and act as a network.</p>
      <p>"We are living in a period of great change for the airfreight industry, and it is imperative that supply chain professionals learn how to take advantage of emerging technologies and trends, as well as explore new ways of collaborating," said Steven Polmans, vice chairman, TIACA, and head of Cargo and Logistics at Brussels Airport Company.</p>
      <p>"Attendees have the option of attending an additional session, 'From theory to practice, getting started with collaborative apps', which looks at how to put theory into practice and even includes live demonstrations, when it takes place on February 1."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, TIACA teamed up with UK-based aviation consultancy TSA Group for an extensive training programme for air cargo professionals, including the development of several new courses aimed at providing participants with a complete overview of the aviation industry.</p>

      <p>AirBridgeCargo Airlines has successfully gained its IATA CEIV Pharma re-certification following two-day audit procedures for compliance with IATA's Center of Excellence for Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) certification program.</p>
      <p>The audit, which was carried out IATA's representing company, was held at Moscow Sheremetyevo International Airport which serves as a cargo hub for ABC operations and also covered all internal process of the company concerning transportation of pharmaceutical products.</p>
      <p>Fedor Novikov, deputy general director, special products said, "Three years ago we became the first airline in Russia to get IATA CEIV Pharma certification, which served as a trigger for further dynamic development of our dedicated 'abc pharma' product. Not only have we managed to achieve more than 20 percent uptick of pharma shipment for the first eight months of 2019 and leveraged around 22,500 tonnes of pharmaceutical products, but we have significantly improved our service quality through continuous personnel training, collaboration with like-minded certified partners, and by following the path of digitalization to achieve higher pharmaceutical handling excellence".</p>
      <p>For the last five years, ABC has built its abc pharma network to support its high-quality service, with 18 QEP and 6 IATA CEIV certified stations.</p>
      <p>Apart from reliable partners, the company counts on up-to-date cold-chain special packaging solutions to maintain the required temperature for pharmaceutical products and is cooperating with the leading manufacturers of temperature-controlled containers. Additional monitoring is guaranteed by data loggers, TPED devices, and data-collection equipment embedded in sophisticated containers.</p>
      <p>Following its lifelong learning approach, ABC pays attention to proper personnel training to upgrade their qualifications both for its team and partners' specialists. So far in 2019 more than 150 specialists have been trained in-house, with 44 of them being from ground handling companies.</p>

      <p>The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) has backed a new initiative encouraging new air cargo leaders of the future and collaboration in the supply chain.</p>
      <p>Staff from companies including Air France KLM Martinair Cargo, Jan De Rijk Logistics, Tosoh Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Agility, and Swissport visited each other's sites to gain a better understanding of processes and explore new ways of collaborating.</p>
      <p>The initiative was launched by TIACA, with the help of Air Cargo Netherlands, as part of the Association's commitment to training and supporting the next generation of air cargo leaders.</p>
      <p>TIACA vice chairman and Jan de Rijk Logistics chief executive officer, Sebastiaan Scholte says: "This initiative will hopefully be the start of many more to follow, where we can develop young talent to be the leaders of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"It is a unique program as it involves a vertical integration of the supply chain with complete openness and transparency.</p>
      <p>"It is more and more difficult to discover and develop talent, especially in small and medium sized companies.</p>
      <p>"Ideally, we would like to see this develop into an internship scheme, so we not only prepare our future talent, but also improve cooperation in the supply chain."</p>
      <p>TIACA's Education and Research Committee members will be discussing next steps for the scheme at their board meeting.</p>
      <p>"We have gained understanding for each of the partners' activities in the air cargo supply chain," says Jan de Rijk Logistics sales manager, Jeroen Leemans, who participated in the initiative last week.</p>
      <p>"What we have found is that by working closely together there is a lot to gain every step of the way. Currently we optimise our own processes and we do a good job, but issues arise around the transfer of information as well as the physical hand-over process.</p>
      <p>"For the air cargo supply chain to grow, we need to understand how to work better together with our partners," he adds.</p>
      <p>TIACA has developed a Professional Development Workshop Program aimed at growing management skills for air cargo professionals. The next workshop takes place in Anchorage, Alaska, from August 29 to 1 September, 2017.</p>
      <p>The program, designed by Strategic Aviation Solutions International (SASI), gives participants an appreciation of the entire air cargo supply chain and the component sectors by encouraging discussion and the sharing of perspectives, as well as providing practical advice and insight.</p>

      <p>Newly launched GSSA network 1GSA has appointed e-Cargoware as its preferred supplier of IT systems, providing all members with access to a cutting-edge GSA management system at preferential rates.</p>
      <p>e-Cargoware is already installed and operational at 1GSA founder member and UK representative, Select Airline Management. Select had been using the system's predecessor since it commenced trading in 2004, and has recently migrated to e-Cargoware.</p>
      <p>M&amp;C Aviation, which was one of the first GSSA companies to join the 1GSA network, covering seven countries in Asia, has also chosen e-Cargoware; it is mid-way through implementation across its branch network.</p>
      <p>e-Cargoware is a state-of-the-art GSSA system with highly-advanced networking features, is web-enabled and cloud-based. Provided as a SaaS (software as a service) solution, it will enable all 1GSA members to interface with each other, and to act as a single unit managed from one location, in cases where airlines wish to appoint multiple 1GSA stations.</p>
      <p>The e-Cargoware system is the successor to the well-established Decmar GSA product, which had been in service for 25 years. It provides a comprehensive suite of functions, including auto quotations, reservations, flight planning and capacity control, AWB stock management, pre-alerts and manifesting to handlers, and auto post flights. It also provides charges calculation, job costing, invoicing, schedule management, CASS settlements processing, sub-GSA management, Cargo-IMP message processing, management reports, customisable CSR reports and track and trace.</p>
      <p>e-Cargoware supports multi-station and multi currency, is e-AWB and e-freight compliant, and uses e-Pouch to store documents electronically. e-Cargoware GSA is one element in a total supply chain solution that can seamlessly link shippers, forwarders, airlines and GSSA, handlers and consignees.</p>
      <p>Using its FR8 Booking web interface, which is mobile-friendly, 1GSA members will be able to provide a customised web-based quotes and booking facility to forwarders, with full background CRM functions that will enhance their business prospecting and promotional capabilities.</p>
      <p>David Lee, president, 1GSA, says, "Our research and personal experience have shown e-Cargoware to be the most advanced GSSA system on offer today. In my own company, Select, it is revolutionising how we work, and definitely strengthens our offering both to forwarders and airlines. It was therefore the obvious choice as the first of our Preferred Suppliers, adding further value to 1GSA membership.</p>
      <p>"The system's web architecture and cloud-based operation, along with its innovative networking features, make it ideal as a uniform platform to support 1GSA's growth. e-Cargoware will enable 1GSA to offer a total cargo management solution to airlines. We will be the first truly digital network GSSA, and this will be a real differentiator, as well as enabling our members to work smarter."</p>

      <p>Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Brussels Airport have launched an airport-to-airport (A2A) pharma corridor for temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals that will pioneer a global network of specialist pharma corridors.</p>
      <p>Pharma shipments travelling the Hong Kong-Brussels airports corridor will be handled in strict compliance with the CEIV Pharma standards and carried by CEIV Pharma-certified airlines.</p>
      <p>As part of the new service, Hong Kong's airport is adding 19 common-use, temperature-controlled cool dollies to its ground fleet for the ramp transfer of pharma goods by airlines, plus it is also building apron shelters to protect pharma shipments from direct weather elements.</p>
      <p>The initiative is in collaboration with Pharma.Aero, which fosters collaboration between airport communities that have achieved IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) certification. Both HKIA and Brussels Airport have attained CEIV Pharma.</p>
      <p>A statement from HKIA said that the initiative aims to "pioneer service offerings and standards that provide assurance in handling quality of the temperature-sensitive pharma products".</p>
      <p>"Shippers will be assured of seamless A2A temperature-controlled handling and provided with handling information, hence assuring the integrity of the shipments. In collaboration with Pharma.Aero and with the participation of pharma shippers, key performance indicators will be defined, targeting to set A2A pharma handling standards," the statement read.</p>
      <p>Alaina Shum, general manager for aviation logistics at Airport Authority Hong Kong, said, "We are pleased to collaborate with Brussels Airport, Europe's key air cargo hub for handling pharmaceutical shipments, to establish this A2A pharma corridor.</p>
      <p>"It marks another milestone in our continuous endeavours to make HKIA a preferred pharmaceutical transshipment hub and to strengthen our status as the world's busiest cargo airport.</p>
      <p>Shum continued: "Moreover, to ensure airport-wide seamless temperature-controlled handling, we are taking delivery of 19 additional cool dollies for common-use by the airlines, meaning that all airlines will always have the option to deploy cool dollies for their temperature-sensitive shipments.</p>
      <p>We are also building apron shelters to protect the pharmaceutical shipments from direct weather elements."</p>
      <p>Steven Polmans, head of cargo and logistics for Brussels Airport, said: "Our aim is to grow the volume of pharmaceutical shipments at Brussels Airport by focusing on quality and transparency.</p>
      <p>"From the beginning, we have reached out to shippers and manufacturers to understand their requirements and work with them and the rest of our cargo community. We have been focusing on improving processes, finding innovative solutions and effectively implementing various projects.</p>
      <p>"With Pharma.Aero, our focus has expanded to cover end-to-end and lane solutions. This cooperation with HKIA for a dedicated pharma lane is a first but important step in creating specialised, dedicated pharma corridors. Our pharma volumes between Brussels and Hong Kong as well as the rest of Asia and Australia are significant, so this improved solution for our customers is being welcomed by the market very much."</p>
      <p>Frank Van Gelder, secretary general of Pharma.Aero, said, "We have received great support from our members including pharmaceuticals companies MSD and Pfizer to participate in this pharma corridor project. Their participation will help to validate the services and key performance indices of the A2A pharma corridor, making sure it provides all pharmaceuticals shippers the genuine value and peace of mind.</p>
      <p>Van Gelder indicated that the Hong Kong initiative will be introduced at other Pharma.Aero member airports, to form a network of pharma corridors.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) is the first cargo terminal operator (CTO) to complete a pilot for IATA's Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit (SFOC). SFOC is part of the Smart Facility program which aims to provide total transparency on capacities and services offered by CTOs, by means of a "multi-tiered validation process". This could save thousands of man-hours every year taken up with largely duplicated auditing effort. Hong Kong's largest independent cargo handler was chosen as the launch test site for the new audit system because, said a spokesperson for Hactl, "of the scale and complexity of its operations, the diverse range of cargo it handles, the number of carriers (over 100) it serves, and the company's highly-developed quality management systems". Glyn Hughes, IATA's Global Head of Cargo, said: "The IATA Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit (SFOC) pilot with Hactl was successful. The feedback received from the Hactl team was valuable in fine-tuning the audit questions, auditor actions and guidance ensuring a consistently high audit quality across the program." SFOC targets a reduction in complexity and number of current industry audits, by adopting all IATA standards relating to cargo terminal operations. "Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit reports will enable carriers to complement their risk analysis data, and conduct more focused on-site audits that are shorter, less resource-intensive and less frequent," explained Hughes. Initially, the program aims to reduce carrier audit complexity by 50%, reducing the burden on cargo terminal operators. The Smart Facility program will encompass remote validation of handling facilities' infrastructure and equipment, supplemented by the SFOC on-site audit. The program will provide a central register of all participating handlers' physical resources and capabilities, and will also confirm that all validated handling agents comply with IATA's Cargo Handling Manual (ICHM), a uniform set of standards and criteria covering all aspects of their operations. "The IATA Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit will provide assurance to the air cargo industry that the published infrastructure, equipment and operating procedure information is complete and accurate," said Marc Voelkl, IATA's project manager – smart facility. "Having validated capacity information of Cargo Terminal Operators publicly available will facilitate better matchmaking between carriers and handlers, and assist in network planning and development, catering precisely to the shippers' needs." The SFOC Audit shares some content with IATA's ISAGO Cargo and Mail (CGM) discipline; an SFOC- accredited CTO will therefore be automatically validated for the CGM discipline. The SFOC Audit will be offered as a stand-alone audit, or in conjunction with ISAGO (refresher) audits, to further reduce accreditation costs and duration of audits. Hactl chief operating officer, Tan Chee Hong, added: "The Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit will provide a simple, public register of all handler's facilities and capabilities, supported by benchmarking against universally accepted industry standards. This can only result in the spread of best practice, and competition based on quality rather than price. "We were very happy to support this excellent initiative from IATA, because Hactl is in favour of any measure that promotes the adoption of high and consistent standards throughout the air cargo industry. We must all eradicate any weak links in air cargo supply chains, for the collective good of the industry – and this is a very effective move towards that goal." Further SFOC pilot audits are to be conducted at handling locations in London, Luxembourg, Singapore, Amsterdam and Dubai throughout the remainder of 2018. Alongside these pilots, IATA will continue development of the Smart Facility Standards Manual and the Smart Facility Auditor Training programme.  Read more Technology news Read more Cargo Airport News Sign up to receive Air Cargo News direct to your inbox for free </p>

    <content>
      <p>To capture some of the growing pharmaceutical air cargo business in China, AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) and Shanghai Pudong International Airport Cargo Terminal Co., Ltd (PACTL) today signed a "memorandum of understanding" (MOU) to  cooperate on providing handling services for time- and temperature-sensitive shipments, such as pharma cargo.</p>
      <p>Under the MOU, both parties agreed to "develop, expand and promote business cooperation" in the area of cool-chain logistics, which corresponds to a strategic cooperation agreement between Russia-based ABC and the Shanghai Airport Authority that was signed last September.</p>
      <p>The agreement concentrates on "the enhancement of operations for pharmaceutical shipments by optimizing internal procedures, strengthening personnel skills, and leveraging innovative IT technologies" so that the carrier and ground handler can deliver superior customer service to pharma shippers</p>
      <p>"The pharmaceutical sector sets the high level of expectations for all supply chain stakeholders," said Sergey Lazarev, general director of ABC Airlines, "Understanding the need for high-end services our customers expect us to provide, we work with forward-thinking and trustworthy partners."</p>
      <p>Christian Haug, vice president of PACTL, said, "Now it's the right time to collaborate with AirBridgeCargo," considering that Both ABC and PACTL have already earned IATA's CEIV-Pharma certification. The PACTL "Cool Center," Haug added, offers 3,500 square meters of temperature-sensitive capacity and can handle up to 100,000 tonnes of cargo annually.</p>
      <p>ABC has steadily expanded its footprint in China since making Shanghai Pudong Airport (PVG) one of its first air cargo stations in China. Currently, the carrier operates more than 20 weekly flights to PVG.</p>

      <p>Brussels Airport and its community have become one of the first air cargo organisations to implement blockchain technology.</p>
      <p>Forming the basis of its Landsite Management Tool, blockchain will be used to track the handover of cargo from handlers to forwarders, under the freight management app.</p>
      <p>"The handover of cargo is an important phase, as it also confers the legal transfer, and liability for the cargo," said Steven Polmans, head of Brussels Airport Cargo.</p>
      <p>"Today it is a very time-consuming and manual process, involving paperwork and different steps. So this is a good example of where blockchain can offer a solution."</p>
      <p>New technologies can be difficult to implement, held back by money or mindset. But Mr Polmans said developing the proof of concept and drafting the scope took just two months. Programming has now begun, with the first pilot set to be introduced in August and the app to be rolled out in October.</p>
      <p>He added that there was no fear of being first mover.</p>
      <p>"The stakeholders embraced this with eagerness," he said. "As always, any change is difficult, but thanks to our cooperation with Air Cargo Belgium and the effects they have seen with earlier BRUcloud applications, it was easier than we expected.</p>
      <p>"Some companies are really frontrunners in exploring new applications, so we are convinced that if we continue our approach of involving them from the beginning, looking at operational needs and efficiency, keeping costs low and offering agile solutions, it will be easier every time."</p>
      <p>The investment cost, he added, was "very acceptable" – but he noted that it was an add-on to BRU's existing slot booking app.</p>
      <p>More applications can be added on to the existing infrastructure using the same technology. Different users can install their own nodes, which can register all transactions and are accessible by all parties with access rights, creating complete transparency.</p>
      <p>Brussels launched its BRUcloud open data-sharing platform for its community in 2016, enabling stakeholders to work on an integrated network, with centrally stored data. Once connected, companies can select which which applications to use.</p>
      <p>"BRUcloud was already creating opportunities and challenging people and companies to look at new options and ways of cooperating," explained Mr Polmans.</p>
      <p>"This application is a next step and introduces new technology that the industry is talking about, but not yet really using. It offers new opportunities and interacts between different parties in the chain, so we do hope this small step is only the first to something much bigger.</p>
      <p>"Using this technology is not really increasing transparency, because cloud-based services could do the same. But it enables us to digitalise a process that involves important liabilities, with the necessary trust and transparency."</p>
      <p>DB Schenker has also stepped into the blockchain arena. With partner VeChain, it has developed a third-party supplier evaluation system to measure the performance of its partners.</p>

      <p>AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) has inked leasing agreement with Sonoco ThermoSafe for the PharmaPort 360 temperature-controlled container.</p>
      <p>This move will bolster ABC's delivery options for temperature-sensitive shipments and guarantee a broader choice of containers available for various pharmaceutical consignments.</p>
      <p>Sonoco's PharmaPort 360 maintains the required temperature in various ambient temperatures from 60C to -40C and can be easily loaded onto standard NAS Series air cargo pallets. Its built-in GPS tracking and GPS Monitoring systems allow for transparent and accurate information to be available in real-time mode.</p>
      <p>This, combined with ABC's Control Tower 24/7, will eliminate the possibility for any deviations from the set point and will give customers extra reassurance of safety and integrity of their shipments.</p>
      <p>"We have been consistently developing and upgrading our 'abc pharma' product, offering our customers dedicated airlift for both passive and active ways of transportation. With PharmaPort 360 being available for lease, we can guarantee another much-needed air freight solution for pharmaceutical goods with precise temperature mode conditions and requirements to maintain an internal environment of 5C. This is a quantum leap for our dedicated product, and we expect it to ramp up our volumes, as well as to gain interest in our services from new customers," highlighted Fedor Novikov, Deputy director, Products of AirBridgeCargo Airlines.</p>
      <p>Christopher Day, director of Business Development &amp; Innovation at Sonoco ThermoSafe said: "As always, our focus is to make it as easy as possible for pharmaceutical shippers and forwarders to directly lease PharmaPort 360s from the leading airlines around the globe, and we are delighted to partner with AirBridgeCargo Airlines to do so."</p>
      <p>For the first three months of 2019, the abc pharma team managed to achieve a more than 15 percent upsurge of volumes for temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical and other medical products.</p>

      <p>Swissport Cargo USA opened a new state-of-the-art warehouse at the Chicago O'Hare International Airport on 20 July.</p>
      <p>The subsidiary of Swissport International says the 138,000-square foot warehouse is designed with a focus on customer needs as well as on safety and efficiency and includes the first automated material handling system in the region.</p>
      <p>A grand opening event of the new facility was held at the North Cargo Area at Chicago O'Haret and was attended by airlines, forwarders, airport and city officials and management and staff at the facility.</p>
      <p>The cargo handler says the automated material handling system makes it first of its kind in the region and can accommodate over 120 10 foot unit ULDs at a time using pallet platforms and electric ULD movers.</p>
      <p>All ULDs can be handled to the highest industry standards without touching the floor. The warehouse operates with two cold storages: 2-8 degrees Celsius and 18-25 degrees Celsius. Both have been designed to meet the IATA CEIV Pharma requirements.</p>
      <p>The facility also has 35 truck docks able to handle the peak seasons and features adjacent aircraft parking with in-ground fuelling and power units to reduce overall handling time of the aircraft on the ground.</p>
      <p>In addition, the material handling system is integrated with the back ramp where ULD's are directly stored into the system or delivered to the customer. These specifications allow Swissport to handle fully-built units from the aircraft to the truck in a considerably short time.</p>
      <p>Swissport USA chief executive officer, Dany Nasr says: "This new investment highlights our commitment towards our customers' needs. We raised the bar to become the new operation standard of Swissport Cargo in the US.</p>
      <p>"This is the first of many steps as we are committed to further invest in our people, facilities and equipment."</p>

      <p>DHL Global Forwarding Belgium has expanded its Brussels Airport facility, with the temperature controlled area growing to 5,300 square metre area.</p>
      <p>The temperature controlled warehouse area now has 2,700 pallet positions spilt over three temperature zones, the largest for goods to be handled between 15-25C.</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding (DGF) Belgium is the first station worldwide to be Thermonet certified, the official standard DGF standard for handling temperature controlled movements.</p>
      <p>The facility also allows in-house screening through x-ray or EDD ensuring cargo is secured without additional external handling.</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding Belgium physical operations director, Charles De Vuyst says: "We have seen a growing demand for pharmaceutical goods and devices which previously were handled as general cargo but now demand a strict temperature handling. We needed to respond quickly. We are proud we managed to build this extension in only 3 months' time meanwhile ensuring business continuity."</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport head of cargo, Steven Polmans says: "Brussels Airport welcomes this initiative, which increases and pushes forward industry standards. This investment is completely aligned with the strategic focus of Brussels Airport on offering a best in class service for pharmaceutical shipments."</p>
      <p>Brussels was the first airport in the world to implement International Air Transport Association Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) certification across the community, and Brussels Airport cargo &amp; product development manager, Nathan De Valck says: "DHL Global Forwarding has successfully obtained the CEIV pharma certification. This guarantees an unbroken cool chain through the airport, standardised handling procedures, bigger transparency and results in a reduced risk for temperature deviations."</p>
      <p>He adds: "Even the transport on the tarmac is included in this coolchain with the deployment of the Airside Pharma Transporters, making Brussels Airport the only fully integrated airport pharma platform."</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport launched Pharma.Aero in 2016 in collaboration with pharmaceutical shippers and other airports to achieve reliable end-to-end air transport for pharma cargo by fostering collaboration between CEIV Pharma certified airport communities.</p>

      <p>Air France KLM Martinair Cargo has achieved IATA pharma certification for four areas of its business and claims that customers are increasingly demanding the credential before they will engage with airlines. The Franco-Dutch airline group achieved IATA Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators Pharma (CEIV) certification in February this year. The four areas of business now covered by the certification are the handling activities at Amsterdam Schiphol and Paris Charles de Gualle airports and the KLM and Air France airline processes. Renate de Walle, KLM Cargo, Director Pharma, said customers were increasingly asking for CEIV certification. "It is becoming much more requested, it is becoming a standard question when requests for proposals come in," she said. AF KLM was also increasingly asking its suppliers, such as cargo handlers, whether they had pharmaceutical transport certification. CEIV also includes guidelines on supplier management to ensure they are up to standard. This helps the airline group ensure that suppliers, and not just its own facilities, meet requirements. There were also gains for AF KLM to having the certification as it helps the airline group win new customers, while pharmaceutical shipment revenues were between 20% and 40% more than when shipping general cargo. The airline group said having the certification also meant it would be in a stronger position to execute assessments of trade lanes and identify potential risks to pharma shipments and fix any concerns. Marcel de Nooijer, executive vice president KLM Cargo &amp; managing director Martinair Cargo, said: "Standardisation is a prerequisite to jointly raise the bar as supply chain partners to better support the pharmaceutical &amp; healthcare industry in conducting their business. "The robust IATA CEIV Pharma program is exactly that: a standard for alignment of the pharmaceutical logistic supply chain." IATA's senior manager special cargo, Andrea Gruber, during the award of the four IATA CEIV Pharma certificates, stated: "The extensive and comprehensive IATA CEIV Pharma programme is not an easy assignment to take, especially given the relative large size of the hub operations at Paris- Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. "The way forward for all parties in the supply chain is global certified trade lanes next to continuous improvement."</p>

      <p>AirBridgeCargo (ABC) has established a new round-the-clock control tower (CT) operation to oversee cargo movements. The control tower will monitor consignments of special cargoes and respond to service disruptions to ensure the airline "consistently meets customers' delivery deadlines". The tower will be managed by a team based in Moscow and provide monitoring of all cargo movements throughout the entire transportation process "from booking to final customer delivery". The team is responsible for identifying and resolving any potential disruption to planned shipment deliveries, such as schedule disruption, documentation issues and the influence of bad weather conditions. The control tower team will focus on special cargoes such as time- and temperature-sensitive products, live animals, off-size &amp; heavy cargoes, e-commerce shipments and other commodities requiring extra attention. ABC general director Sergey Lazarev said: "Our new Control Tower is a 'point of convergence' which will accumulate all of our cargo movement data to consistently meet our service commitments, and to take preventative or corrective actions as appropriate when they see a potential disruption developing. "This will be the foundation of our next step forwards in the arena of special cargoes, and is ultimately designed to provide benefits to final consumers, be it medicines or vaccines for their health and well-being, aircraft engines to resolve AOG situations and ensure passengers reach their destinations in good time, or the on-time delivery of cross-border ecommerce purchases for special occasions." ABC said its special cargo volumes have grown by 12% year on year in 2017. Read more freighter operator news</p>

      <p>Realising the importance of maintaining product quality and safety of pharmaceuticals in the supply chain, Panalpina has initiated strong initiatives to increase the number of GDP-certification in all its business units, across the globe.</p>
      <p>This will help Panalpina to meet expectations of its healthcare customers.</p>
      <p>According to the company, pharmaceutical companies largely require their business units that handle pharma products are complaint with Good Distribution Practice (GDP), which sets various guidelines for proper distribution of medicinal products for human use.</p>
      <p>Currently, 70 business units of Panalpina around the world are GDP-compliant. Out of these, 30 are GDP-certified, and the number is on the rise. The GDP quality assurance standard, includes stringent requirement to handle, storage and distribution of pharmaceutical products.</p>
      <p>"With increasingly global supply chains, and the emergence of high-value products, there is a growing demand for strict quality and temperature-control measures to ensure safety and integrity of pharmaceutical products across long-distance deliveries," said Andreas Sahli, global head of industry vertical healthcare, Panalpina.</p>
      <p>"Stakeholders across the supply chain can rely on us to deliver GDP-compliant transport, storage and distribution solutions worldwide," said Sahli.</p>
      <p>Panalpina holds thousands of trainings on GDP topics every year, and around 3,000 employees are currently GDP-qualified.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Panalpina is expected to roll out its own GDP training materials, and will continue its program to qualify its staff. It will help the company to expand its capabilities and knowledge.</p>
      <p>Quality management is key to Panalpina's success. Its quality, health, safety and environment (QHSE) team performs 40-50 GDP audits every year, and look for opportunities to improve its established processes and standards, and identifies systemic issues, which requires attention.</p>
      <p>"When a non-conformance is identified, a root-cause analysis is performed immediately to identify the origin of the issue, and a corrective action plan is developed," said Lindsay Zingg, global head of QHSE, Panalpina.</p>
      <p>SYSTEMATIC SUBCONTRACTOR MANAGEMENT</p>
      <p>As an asset light organisation, Panalpina is critically dependent on the performance of its subcontractors, and their adherence to the agreed processes and procedures. As part of its environmental, quality and safety management systems, Panalpina also conducts rigorous subcontractor audits, whereby the working standards and corporate controls of subcontractors are assessed regularly.</p>
      <p>The audits, include environmental performance standards, and adherence to labor and human rights performance. In 2017, 266 subcontractor audits were performed.</p>
      <p>Panalpina is using 'Validaide', a new online platform to qualify its key suppliers and make lane-risk assessments, especially for the healthcare industry.</p>
      <p>On the open platform, customers and suppliers are connected to standardise and improve supplier qualification for different product categories and transport modalities.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Validaide will be further rolled out to continue to leverage advantages of the system.</p>

      <p>Cargolux Airlines has signed an agreement with Trinkaus-Solutions to use its squAIR-timber product that results in more payload and lower aircraft fuel consumption. Cargolux said that it is the first airline worldwide to introduce the lightweight material in its operations, and currently uses it on all pharma shipments out of its home hub in Luxembourg. The all cargo carrier said that the cardboard fiber composite beams contain only raw materials from sustainable sources that differ significantly from conventional corrugated products and provides an excellent economic and ecological long term replacement for wooden material. Trinkaus-Solutions says that the beams have a load capacity of up to 10 tons. At the same time, they are significantly lighter than the conventional wooden beams they replace, with a weight of only 1.2 kg per meter. They are also resistant to humidity. At the same time, it is 80% lighter than the conventional wood it replaces, thus allowing more payload and a lower fuel consumption of Cargolux's aircraft, which directly translates to lower aircraft engine emissions. "Cargolux is proud to be at the forefront of developments again with Trinkaus-Solutions' innovative products", says Lars Syberg, Cargolux EVP Global Logistics. "The use of modern, environmentally-conscious tools in air cargo underlines our standing as a green cargo carrier at a time when many of our customers put more emphasis on working with a partner who is aware of its responsibility towards the world we live in. "In addition, Trinkaus-Solutions provides us with products that make Cargolux more efficient and faster with the added advantage of lower costs. It's an all-round winner for us." Cargolux estimates that the use of squAIR-timber has the potential to reduce its fuel consumption by roughly 1,200 tons per year, lower fuel consumption of Cargolux's aircraft, which directly results in lower aircraft engine emissions. In addition, said Cargolux, squAIR-timber solution "enables shorter build-up times, eliminating the need for forklifts as they can easily be handled by one person". They can be reused and are 100% recyclable with lower disposal costs than wooden materials.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong-based logistics company Tigers grows North American presence by nearly doubling its storage capacity in Miami to about 31,000 square feet in a move to a new facility.</p>
      <p>The investment will allow Tigers to both "grow our focus on the Latin American region, as well as expand our capabilities to service the growing e-commerce market," branch manager Elena Varona said.</p>
      <p>The facility is bonded and serves as a Container Freight Station (CFS) and as an In-Bond Export Consolidation (IBEC) warehouse to service shippers that conduct trade through the prominent cross-border hub.</p>
      <p>"The team will play a key role in further growing our eTigers product, providing end-to-end supply chain solutions for online customers around the world," Varona said. The "eTigers" platform, one of the company's more unique initiatives, is a platform for shippers to host their products. Currently, merchants of products like wine and spirits, as well items like barbeque grills, have their products available for purchase on the website.</p>
      <p>"All of this is boosted by our unique forwarding and consolidation capabilities into Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as out of China."</p>
      <p>The company has invested in the e-commerce movement through various initiatives. In late 2018, Tigers launched Cloud-based SmartHub:Connect, a freight, e-commerce, and logistics portal offering end-to-end supply chain visibility. Later this year, Tigers plans to launch a new cross-border e-commerce service from Miami to Europe, of which details are forthcoming.</p>

      <p>IAG Cargo, the freight operations wing of the joint Anglo-Spanish carrier enterprise, has signed a global container rental deal with thermal packaging provider va-Q-tec. As a result, IAG Cargo will be able to use va-Q-tec's va-Q-tainers to transport temperature-sensitive freight. va-Q-tainers offer control over six different temperature ranges, from -70°C to +25°C, in five container sizes. They will be will used by IAG Cargo as an advanced passive shipping option that requires no external energy input. The units make use of phase change materials (thermal energy storage components that absorb and store thermal energy during a freezing or heating process without considerably changing their temperature) to ensure a consistent temperature during shipment. "This agreement offers our customers wanting to ship temperature sensitive goods an excellent and cost efficient solution," enthused Alan Dorling, global head, pharmaceuticals and life sciences at IAG Cargo. "With consistent year on year growth in Constant Climate shipments, we are continually investing in innovative customer solutions that match our own high standards; as such we are fully confident that this agreement will be welcomed by customers looking to ship pharmaceuticals across the globe," he added. Dominic Hyde, va-Q-tec's managing director, remarked: "The broad network offered by IAG Cargo and the integrated va-Q-tainer serviced rental offer will provide pharma shippers with a reliable door-to-door temperature-controlled solution that meets challenging requirements for global health care cold chains." Just a week ago, IAG Cargo unveiled plans to build a new £55m facility for premium freight and pharma at its London Heathrow site in response to growth in its services for high-value cargo. The new terminal, to be called New Premia, will double the size of the existing 10-year-old Premia building and will offer a larger dedicated constant climate centre for pharmaceuticals. Va-Q-tec has also won new customers elsewhere. In July, it was confirmed that Italian carrier Alitalia had signed an agreement with the company to rent its passive containers. Pharma shippers and forwarders can order the service directly through the Italian airline.</p>

      <p>American Airlines Cargo is hoping to become the latest airline – and the first US carrier − to achieve IATA's pharmaceutical transportation certification in response to growing demand in the sector and stricter regulations. Initial stations that will aim to complete the Center for Excellence and Independent Validators (CEIV) certification include American's home base and key hub Dallas-Fort Worth International (DFW), and Miami International (MIA). The airline will also certify Philadelphia International (PHL) in support of its dedicated, 25,000 square-foot pharmaceutical and healthcare handling facility that opened in 2015. American said demand for temperature management services continues to grow at a rapid pace due to market growth, necessary product requirements and stringent global regulations. "With the increase in regulatory oversight of pharmaceutical logistics comes the industry-wide need to ensure quality handing from all stakeholders," it said.  "We're extremely proud of our temperature-control network," said Tom Grubb, American's manager of cold chain strategy for its cargo division. "Our focus is on moving pharmaceuticals safely and efficiently across the globe, and being the first US carrier to promote this certification will help show our partners and customers how confident we are in our abilities to offer the best cold-chain service possible." The IATA certification impartially validates the capabilities associated with the proper transportation of delicate, temperature-controlled pharmaceutical shipments. "In addition to the facilitation of critical training for warehouse handling staff on regulations and best practices, the certification includes the assessment and verification of properly-equipped facilities, processes and operational effectiveness for the correct handling of these sensitive products—all efforts American has focused heavily on over the recent years," the airline said. Earlier this month, Lufthansa Cargo became the sixth carrier to achieve the certificate, joining Finnair, CAL, Air France KLM, Cargolux and Turkish Cargo.</p>

      <p>Freight forwarders within Brussels airport's BRUcargo community are saving air waybill (AWB) processing time by accessing the new Customs Export Application which went live on July 1. This latest application is one of several made possible by BRUcloud, the open community platform at the Belgian hub based on Nallian's data-sharing technology and initiated by Brussels' cargo department three years ago. The app combines manifest data, which has been made available in the BRUcloud since 2016, with newly added data from the forwarders. The app matches the collected data at AWB level and reports a complete set of information automatically to customs. "It is the first result whereby information from different sources can be linked to one new solution, without much effort, but with great impact on the day-to-day operation of the companies participating," said Steven Polmans, head of cargo and logistics at Brussels Airport Co, adding: "This is one of the several benefits we aimed for when developing our community platform." The cargo arm of Brussels airport said that forwarders who opt to connect to the app can "drastically improve their efficiency by avoiding having to wait in lines at the Customs offices for the stamping of AWBs, avoiding having to create Excel list reports and having to collect alternative evidence manually, thus eliminating paper-based procedures and the resulting errors". The Customs authorities now also give clearance priority to forwarders' shipments handled via the app, saving time compared with the previous manual process for verifying documents. The initiative to develop the "quick-win app" came from the Customs working group, one of several organised by Air Cargo Belgium (ACB), the air cargo community representation group. "This app is a win for both the Customs authorities and the forwarders. A fine example of the fruitful cooperation between the stakeholders at BRUcargo" said a spokesperson for BDP International one of the six companies already using the app on a daily basis. David Bellon, director of airfreight at DHL Global Forwarding Belgium, said: "It was great to see the collaborative approach in the community resulted in an application that addressed the urgent needs of the entire forwarding community. "Together with the other members of BAFI, DHL Global Forwarding was happy to provide support in developing it." More than 25 companies have already confirmed that they will roll out the app in the coming weeks, covering 90% of the volumes handled at BRUcargo. "This collaboratively created app results in a lower administrative burden for all the parties. Digitization within BRUcargo will further lower the chances of errors and will help to drastically decrease lead times," said Bart Vleugels, advisory general at Federal Public Service of Finance, Customs and Excise Duties. Later this year, the BRUcargo slot application will be introduced, reducing waiting times at the handlers' premises. "The application is undergoing final testing with the partners in our project group and the results are meeting our expectations", said Sara Van Gelder, leading the BRUcloud project at BRUcargo. She added: "We are excited and look forward going live with additional partners in the last quarter of this year." Read more cargo airport news</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo, the cargo and logistics arm of Etihad Airways, has cemented its position as a leading international air cargo carrier after becoming only the second carrier to be awarded IATA's Centre of Excellence for Perishable Logistics (CEIV Fresh) in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>The new award elevates Etihad Cargo as the first Middle East airline to hold both of IATA's CEIV Fresh and CEIV Pharma certifications, and one of the two carriers globally to claim this dual honour. The carrier's dedicated FreshForward product today receives a significant validation for its end-to-end temperature-controlled solution for fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat and flowers across its global network.</p>
      <p>To secure the twin certifications within a remarkable frame of one calendar year, Etihad Cargo was required to meet global IATA standards, International requirements and best practices, as well as pass stringent food safety management protocols within Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) methodology.</p>
      <p>Abdulla Mohamed Shadid, managing director cargo and logistics at Etihad Aviation Group, said: "Acquiring our second CEIV certification in a single year is a significant achievement for Etihad Cargo and underlines the product-specific quality of service we deliver across our global network. In-line with our commitment to offer a diverse portfolio of industry-leading products to Etihad Cargo's global customers, FreshForward is destined for further investment and growth."</p>
      <p>Frederic Leger, director, airport, passenger, Cargo and Security products, IATA, added: "Perishable goods is a growing market for air cargo. Ensuring that these delicate and short shelf-life products reach the customer unspoiled with minimal loss is essential. I want to congratulate both Etihad Cargo and Etihad Airport Services (EAS) in achieving the Center of Excellence for Perishable Logistics (CEIV Fresh) certification. CEIV Fresh certification provides stakeholders throughout the air cargo supply chain with the assurance that certified companies are operating to the highest quality and standards in the transport of perishable products."</p>
      <p>In addition to covering Etihad Cargo's airline operations, the CEIV's Fresh Certification also comprises cargo handling and warehousing at Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH). With a multi-phased cargo infrastructure development strategy in place, including an expanded fresh facility, Etihad Cargo is committed to developing a Cool Chain Centre of Excellence at its state-of-the-art UAE hub.</p>

      <p>DHL has opened an Asia Pacific Innovation Center (APIC) in Singapore, a multi-million dollar facility that will offer a visionary view of logistics and develop innovative solutions to meet evolving supply chain needs. Supported by the country's Economic Development Board (EDB), the Singapore APIC showcases futuristic technologies such as augmented reality "smart glasses" for warehouse assembly-lines and product picking; drones for delivery of time-critical goods like medicines; vehicles that use sensors to cut maintenance time; and driverless shuttles for faster, more efficient transportation. APIC also serves as a regional platform for collaborative innovation between DHL, customers, industry partners and independent experts. The first of its kind in the region, the facility forms part of the €104-million DHL Supply Chain Advanced Regional Center (ARC) building at Singapore's Tampines LogisPark. It is modelled on DHL's first innovation centre in Germany, which was improved and re-launched earlier this year. Deutsche Post DHL Group chief executive, Frank Appel commented: "Innovative ideas are key for our future success. Our focus on customer-centric innovations and the development of products and services that our customers need most, will help us to remain the logistics leader. By analysing social, business and technology trends, and converting our innovations into marketable solutions, we will make our customers more successful." Chief commercial officer, Bill Meahl, added: "Our sustained industry leadership demands that we successfully differentiate our services in these markets through well-calculated forays into new technologies, processes, and products. The launch of the APIC in Singapore is a natural step to maintain our lead as a frontrunner in innovation, following the success of our first centre in Germany. Singapore's position as an innovation hub, its excellent infrastructure and sophisticated workforce make it an excellent base from which we can achieve strong and consistent growth in the region." Visitors can enjoy customised visits with a selection of services including guided tours, innovation workshops, events and forums. They can also experience the full range of Deutsche Post DHL Group capabilities and solutions such as parcel lockers, sensor technology and warehouse pick and pack using voice and lighting technologies. EDB's director of logistics and natural resources, EDB Lee Eng Keat, said, "The launch of the APIC is another important step towards enhancing Singapore's value-adding role in the realm of global supply chain solutions. With DHL as a strategic partner on this journey, Singapore is well positioned to serve the needs and harness the opportunities presented by the dynamic supply chain landscape and emerging technology and trends globally. This would continue to strengthen Singapore's position as a world-leading logistics hub."</p>

      <p>IAG Cargo has announced Constant Climate shipments are now able to fly under its Critical product, enabling emergency medical shipments to benefit from its highest priority service.</p>
      <p>The new enhancement means shippers sending urgent pharmaceuticals now have access to the non-off loadable status and performance guarantees offered under Critical.</p>
      <p>Less than a year since its launch, Critical has already carried over 2000 emergency shipments for businesses across the world and the range of goods moved has been diverse – from pre-launch consumer electronic devices to formula one tyres to factory down machine parts – all have required the 'must fly' status guaranteed by Critical.</p>
      <p>Following successful trials of Constant Climate Critical across India, the UK and Europe, IAG Cargo is rolling out this new offering across all 109 Constant Climate enabled stations on its network.</p>
      <p>Global Head of pharmaceuticals and life sciences, Alan Dorling says: "We are proud of the significant investment that we continue to make into our Constant Climate product and the infrastructure that supports it.</p>
      <p>"We were one of the first carriers to offer a dedicated pharmaceutical shipment product and today our teams across the world deliver the highest level of care and expertise when transporting high-value, temperature-sensitive goods.</p>
      <p>"The development of Constant Climate Critical means that we are now able to build on our offering by providing vital vaccines and emergency lifesaving medicines with a non-off loadable status.</p>
      <p>"In addition to our highest priority grading, the product continues to safeguard temperature-specific shipment requirements, maintaining the purity, potency and stability of the lifesaving medicines that we carry."</p>
      <p>Commercial director, David Shepherd adds: "Critical has been a real success; demand has come from right across our network and week on week we see both new requests and repeat business.</p>
      <p>"We know that there is a real demand for guaranteed capacity and a must-fly service for urgent pharmaceutical products and it is crucial that we continue to innovate to ensure that we meet our customers' needs."</p>
      <p>IAG expects the Constant Climate Critical will be popular across key pharmaceutical trade lanes, from manufacturing hubs in India and Europe and into burgeoning pharmaceutical markets such as Latin America.</p>
      <p>The service offers guaranteed capacity up to the maximum aircraft operating limit, and a dedicated monitoring service through hubs at Heathrow, Madrid and Dublin. Customers shipping through the carrier's Heathrow and Madrid hubs will also benefit from a dedicated Critical check-in desk, significantly speeding up drop off and collection times.</p>

      <p>Major US carrier United Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa Cargo have launched their previously announced air cargo joint venture.</p>
      <p>Effective May 3, the two carriers jointly manage sales and booking of standard and express shipments on routes between Europe and the US using their joint venture framework.</p>
      <p>Starting with selected routings from the US, Italy, Great Britain, Ireland and Germany, the carriers will expand the geographical scope in the coming months and plan to include additional products and features in the future.</p>
      <p>"The combination of the two strong networks offers new routing options. The co-location of our warehouses, in Munich for example, is an additional benefit, with customers needing only one location for export drop-off and import delivery. Aligned processes and quicker transfers between separate warehouses also lead to streamlined transport times," said Peter Gerber, chairman and CEO of Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>"Through our joint venture, United and Lufthansa Cargo offer transatlantic shippers more options that produce these benefits – including increased frequencies on a combined network accessible through either partner's booking channels. Our aligned teams and processes also deliver the superior service quality essential to our customers' success," said Jan Krems, president, United Cargo.</p>

      <p>Freight forwarder Panalpina has reached agreement to acquire two more perishables logistics companies, the Cool Chain Group in Germany (CCG) and Interfresh Airfreight Handling, for undisclosed sums. CCG currently has 100 customers and handles around 14,000 tonnes of air freight per year. It parent company, Rungis Express, is to concentrate on its core business of overland distribution and the wholesaling and move away from international freight forwarding. Panalpina chief executive Stefan Karlen said: "Our recent acquisitions in the perishables market have concentrated on the export side, but we also want to increase our footprint in key import markets and build our end-to-end perishables capabilities at major gateways such as Frankfurt and Amsterdam. These latest developments are further important steps towards offering complete end-to-end solutions on a global scale as we continue to expand our perishables network." The former managing director of CCG, Markus Kampa becomes Panalpina's new country head of Perishables Germany. Panalpina will also have access to cold storage space at CCG's temperature-controlled transit warehouse in Kelsterbach, close to Frankfurt Airport and will continue to benefit from CCG's overland distribution network and cool chain capabilities in Germany and neighboring countries. On the Netherlands, new acquisition, Interfresh Airfreight Handling specialises in customs clearance and last-mile distribution of imported perishables from Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Panalpina said the move was another step in building its global Perishables Network, following its earlier acquisition of Kenya-based forwarder Air Connection. Panalpina will also buy Interfresh's sister companies Fresh Cargo Connection and Dutch Cargo Connection, subject to conditions. All three companies are fully owned by chief executive and founder, Sonja Kauffman, who will join Panalpina as the new country head of perishables for the Netherlands. Karlen said: "By acquiring Interfresh we gain full control over the cool chain for one of the perishables industry's most important trade lanes for flowers – from Nairobi to Amsterdam and beyond. It is also a logical transaction as the primary customer of Interfresh is Air Connection, the Kenya-based forwarder that we successfully acquired earlier this year." The move will also significantly expand its perishables offering in customs clearance and distribution of imported flowers from Kenya and other perishables from many origins in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Other important origin countries besides Kenya are Sri Lanka, South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, Ethiopia, Turkey, Colombia and Ecuador.  Fresh Cargo Connection acts as a fiscal representative for customers and Dutch Cargo Connection provides services for other perishables such as fish, fruit, vegetables and mushrooms. All three companies are based at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport with a cold storage facility and an experienced team handles around 20,000 tonnes of perishable air freight per year. Sonja Kauffman, who founded Interfresh in 2004, commented: "In more than ten years we have built a solid and respected business and steadily grown our perishables volumes. We are very proud of what we've achieved so far and now is the right time to secure further profitable growth, especially in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Panalpina has the global network, tools and connections to help us achieve that." Karlen concluded: "The acquisition in the Netherlands is another significant step in building Panalpina's global Perishables Network and offering complete end-to-end solutions on a global scale. It also exemplifies how we expand our presence and expertise in destination countries and at major transportation hubs for perishables."</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo will continue its digital drive by rolling out a new messaging system and a new API-based booking system.</p>
      <p>The airline said that it had successfully completed trials of an automated Freight Forwarder Messaging system that will allow bookings to be instantly made and confirmed.</p>
      <p>These pilots were undertaken with DHL Express and DB Schenker and completed successfully in March 2019, and are in the process of being progressively rolled out across their global operations as well as to other key forwarder customers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the airline said that it is also developing a new distribution channel featuring API along with web services to provide customers with quote-to-booking functionality before the start of the third quarter.</p>
      <p>These two developments follow on from the airline implementing the IBS iCargo solution and an online booking portal in 2018.</p>
      <p>Six months on from the launch of the portal, the airline has seen online bookings reach a penetration rate of 14.4% and it now has more than 6,000 registered users.</p>
      <p>Rory Fidler, head of technology and innovation, Etihad Cargo, said: "Etihad has made great strides in implementing the first phase of its digital ambitions over the past 18 months. We placed investments in digital transformation and innovation at the core of our new strategy, underpinning a renewed customer-driven culture within the organisation.</p>
      <p>"The fruits of that investment and hard work are transforming the way we interact and do business with our customers, and are opening up a multitude of future opportunities.</p>
      <p>"Within such a short period of time we have gone from being a very conventional air cargo operator, to being the most digitized air cargo carrier of our size globally," added Fidler. "As we move forward, we will continue to invest in technology and seek to put ourselves at the forefront of the industry's drive for digitalisation."</p>

      <p>Swissport International, one of the leading cargo handling companies, yesterday announced the opening of its state-of-the-art Pharma Center for temperature-sensitive cargo shipments at Brussels Airport.</p>
      <p>The new facility offers 3,620 square metres of temperature-controlled warehouse space. Upon completion, the cargo complex will boast some 25,000 square metres of warehouse space.</p>
      <p>According to the cargo handing firm, this facility is the 'company's most advanced temperature-controlled cargo warehouse globally'.</p>
      <p>The new center is located adjacent to Swissport's existing air cargo facility in the northwest of the airport in the Belgian capital.</p>
      <p>Luzius Wirth, executive vice president Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa of Swissport International said: "We can now provide a seamless, high-quality service from the trucks to the aircraft cargo hold. The Swissport Pharma Center at Brussels Airport will play a key role in our growing global network of temperature-controlled warehouses. We are excited to contribute to a thriving Belgian Pharma Valley."</p>
      <p>"In the new Swissport Pharma Center two important Belgian assets come together, our unique location in Europe and a traditionally strong pharma sector," says Alexander De Croo, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Development Cooperation.</p>
      <p>"Belgium is the second largest pharma exporter in Europe and no airport in the world has a better quality track record in temperature-sensitive transport of pharmaceutical products than Brussels Airport. I am convinced that the new Swissport Pharma Center will further boost these important Belgian assets."</p>
      <p>Featuring two areas for the handling of pharmaceutical products, the facility is equipped with eight dedicated truck docks, allowing for a fully temperature-controlled transfer of containers and pallets to the warehouse, regardless of the outside temperature.</p>
      <p>The facility's new, automated material handling system with its 432 rack and ground positions, caster decks and associated forklifts and pallet movers, which are exclusively operated in the high-sensitive pharma area, ensure an efficient and safe handling.</p>
      <p>Swissport has signed a 20-year lease contract for the new facility and is investing roughly 11 million Euros in interior fittings, namely an automated material handling system and special cooling installations.</p>
      <p>Construction work at the new facility started in January 2019 and will take about two years to complete in a phased approach. After a construction period of only ten months, the Swissport Pharma Center is the first part of a refurbishment project, which covers 25,000 sqm of warehouse space.</p>
      <p>Landside, the completed warehouse will feature 47 truck loading bays in a closed perimeter. Airside, 'speed gates' will facilitate quick and efficient cargo handling.</p>
      <p>The full development project will also include a new four-story office building, to be completed in the autumn of 2020.</p>
      <p>Swissport Belgium handles more than 550,000 tonnes of air cargo per year.</p>

      <p>Glyn Hughes, head of cargo for IATA.</p>
      <p>MIAMI – IATA's global head of cargo, Glyn Hughes, said the logistics business is not keeping up with technology – a sentiment that's been expressed before, but one he said cannot be emphasized enough. Hughes, who addressed attendees at today's ACMG Workshop, which is part of the Cargo Facts Symposium (CFS) 2015, also called for more communication across the airfreight supply chain.</p>
      <p>Hughes keyed in on the importance of and level of sophistication required in shipping high-value goods that must go by air, including include high-tech goods, perishables and pharmaceuticals. According to Hughes, a leading pharmaceutical company claims that "80 percent of their failed shipments were due to air cargo and a lack of knowledge by those who are handling it."</p>
      <p>To solve this problem, Hughes emphasized the necessity of increased attention on customer service and technology in the airfreight business. "Air cargo must transform itself into a lean, adaptive and innovative industry centered around increasingly sophisticated customer demands," he said.</p>
      <p>He continued by stating that it's very important that relationships must remain positive between air carriers, forwarders and ground handlers. "Airlines and forwarders must not be adversarial," he said. He also said air cargo needs more liberalized traffic rights. "Information should be shared on a community basis," he said. "This is how the integrators work. Data sharing is critical."</p>
      <p>Air cargo comprises less than 1 percent of international trade by volume, Hughes said, yet it makes up 35 percent of the value of goods that are transported internationally because of the high-dollar value of the goods being shipped. When he commented that the world's cutting-edge technologies are being shipped on a supply chain with some of the world's least-sophisticated systems, the irony was not lost on the CFS audience.</p>
      <p>The good news is e-commerce is exploding, and new innovations such as airships, 3D printing and drone vehicles are all in formative stages. Rather than being a threat to air cargo, 3D printing technology will be good for the industry, he said, because the components and actual printers will need to be shipped by air.</p>

      <p>American Airlines Cargo recently announced the roll-out of a new cargo end-to-end management system in partnership with IBS Software.</p>
      <p>This transition to a new system replaces the majority of the organization's legacy technology, narrowing 90 systems down to less than 10.</p>
      <p>The US carrier informed that it has launched the first phase of its single largest investment to-date.</p>
      <p>The new system is powered by the iCargo platform and has a host of modern technology components, driving transformation in Sales, Operations, Customer Experience, and Accounting, allowing for more efficient online channels, better tracking, greater efficiency in warehouses, and a robust back-end system that will further strengthen both the customer and team member experience.</p>
      <p>The transition to iCargo provides the foundation for a host of innovations and initiatives expected to be rolled out in in the next 12 months and beyond.</p>
      <p>The technology transition impacts more than 8,000 team members in cargo and airport operations, and more than 30,000 customers.</p>
      <p>A team of more than 700 people across 300 locations globally and more than 150 business, technology, and vendor partners at the airline's new headquarters in Ft. Worth, TX supported the implementation process.</p>
      <p>Jessica Tyler, vice president Strategy and Development for American Airlines Cargo, has led the technology initiative since its genesis nearly three years ago.</p>
      <p>From the start, her team has been united in the belief that a people-first philosophy is necessary for this kind of transformation to succeed and move the business into the future.</p>
      <p>"While standing up the new system has been a huge accomplishment, I'm most proud of our people. Even with the challenges of a project this size, we continue to have a 'bring it on' attitude and remain focused on moving forward. The way the team cares for one another is what makes us uniquely ready for change," said Tyler.</p>
      <p>American Airlines completes 75 years of cargo operations</p>
      <p>"The scale and size of the American Airlines Cargo enterprise challenged us to dig deep into our experience and skills to lead this implementation, said Philip Scaria, Programme manager for IBS Software and lead of the modernization effort.</p>
      <p>In addition to leading Cargo's modernization efforts, Tyler also heads the product innovation and alliances teams. Her organization focuses on the future outlook – specifically how Cargo plans and invests in the right technologies, products, partnerships and ways of doing business to best serve customers.</p>

      <p>As part of its Smart Cargo Mainport Program (SCMP) to instill trust and transparency in the supply chain value chain, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol has recently linked the flower shipment data to its new portal, Air Waybill.</p>
      <p>SCMP aims to transform Schiphol as a smartest airport in Europe, through enhanced data sharing. It includes initiatives taken by the Holland Flower Alliance Data Sharing Working Group, which had primarily piloted the scheme.</p>
      <p>According to Schiphol, Flower shipment data, comprising number of boxes, flower type and number of flowers and stems in each box, will be linked to the Air Waybill numbers by the new portal, which will subsequently generate a unique GLN code that would offer all users an access to the overall data stored in one place.</p>
      <p>During a pilot run conducted between Nairobi and Kenya, to the flower auction in Aalsmeer in the Netherlands, flowers shipments could be traceable in real time, which included product and shipment information.</p>
      <p>The unique GLN code comprises a shipment reference and an order code, which creates a universally recognised format that cannot be duplicated. It also provides end-to-end visibility, which can be access by every supply chain partner through their own internal systems.</p>
      <p>Besides, it provides more information to every party in the supply chain to effectively track and trace their shipments in real time during the entire journey. It also offer options to effectively plan their operations and make changes in real time.</p>
      <p>"With the help of a close collaboration between the floriculture and air cargo sectors, we are now able to link two critical sets of data, and foster trust between parties, by making the data available to everyone, in real time," said Jonas van Stekelenburg, head of cargo, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.</p>
      <p>"The new portal uses a unique 'global standard 1' code (GLN), which is combined with an order number. With this, the system mitigates duplication of either order numbers or Air Waybill numbers," said Stekelenburg.</p>
      <p>Holland Flower Alliance partners, along with Kuehne + Nagel and Panalpina are currently working towards user-friendly ways to present the data to the end customer.</p>
      <p>"This unique collaboration with the help of SCMP and the Holland Flower Alliance is of great value for the precious supply chain of floriculture cargo," said Marcel de Nooijer, EVP, Air France KLM and managing director, Martinair.</p>
      <p>"By joining hands, we are planning to increase efficiency, quality, and lower costs throughout the entire supply chain. The development and launch of this data sharing platform is a proof that we are doing 'new stuff' to benefit all stakeholders in the floriculture chain," said Stekelenburg.</p>
      <p>The portal was developed after consultation with the cargo community, which identified priorities for the perishable cool chain, with the ability to track and trace on box level, from farm to auction, which is a priority for all parties.</p>
      <p>"The portal offers access to sensitive data only to authorised parties, thereby increasing trust and cooperation. It will further help in encouraging collaboration towards common goals," said Koos van der Meij, project manager, Information Sharing Working Group.</p>
      <p>The SCMP aims to increase efficiency at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by way of enhanced use to data sharing. The projects that fall under the program, includes Pharma Gateway Amsterdam, and EU Green Fast Lanes.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Brussels Airport has reached the next stage of digitisation with the cloud based data sharing platform, Nallian releasing its Slot Booking Application to the community.</p>
      <p>The Slot Booking Application will eliminate problems of waiting times and idle times at ground handling facilities by coordinating the match between supply and demand of time slots by streamlining the pick-up and delivery of freight at ground handlers and leads to a better capacity utilisation and elimination of peak and idle-times.</p>
      <p>The app makes it possible for the booker to request a single or recurrent time slot at a specific facility via the same central web-application for all ground handlers, while the supplier can make time slots for different cargo types available via the web-application or a system-to-system link with its internal slot management system.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport head of cargo, Steven Polmans says: "It is only a couple of months ago that we started to define the scope of our first release. Today this release has been developed and the first testing-sessions have been extremely positive."</p>
      <p>Cargo development manager, Sara Van Gelder, who is in charge of digitalisation projects at BRUcargo adds: "In the meanwhile the conversations and brainstorms with the community keep going on and the next features are already being defined! The Slot Booking App will open a lot of opportunities for future applications."</p>
      <p>Nallian chief executive officer, Jean Verheyen says: "This application is our next step in the digital roadmap to make BRUcargo the most efficient, smart and attractive logistical platform in Europe."</p>
      <p>The app is available to the stakeholders at BRUcargo via the BRUcloud, and can be implemented in other communities around the world.</p>
      <p>BRUcloud was initiated in 2015 and Polman's vision was to enable seamless collaboration between all cargo actors around the airport by installing an open community platform to allow them to easily collaborate through a pool of shared data.</p>
      <p>Since going live, it has been extended with a dashboard visualising the quality of pharma shipments and a statistical application to create insight in the freight volumes at BRUcargo.</p>

      <p>Cargo handler dnata has received Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) certification from IATA for its pharma-handling processes and facilities in Dubai.</p>
      <p>dnata's two-year preparation for certification included working closely with Dubai Airports to implement facility changes and upgrades to align with CEIV requirements. The company was assessed on its cool chain processes and facilities.</p>
      <p>These were validated to comply with all applicable standards, guidelines and regulations, including EU, World Health Organisation (WHO), United States Phamacopeia (USP) and IATA Temperature Control Regulations (TCR).</p>
      <p>"At dnata, we've continuously focussed on providing our customers with enhancements in the safety and security of their pharma shipments. This CEIV certification is a demonstration of that commitment," said Bernd Struck, Senior Vice President, UAE Cargo &amp; DWC Airline Services, dnata.</p>
      <p>"We use the latest technology, best practices and certified warehouses to ensure that every pharma and vaccine shipment that reaches the patient is handled in compliance with international certified standards."</p>
      <p>With the certification, the handler aims to eliminate the chances of spoilage of highly perishable pharma cargo, and optimise the air cargo supply chain with standardisation, accountability transparency, reliability and predictability.</p>
      <p>It has specialised pharma-handling facilities and equipment in Amsterdam, Dallas, Dubai, Houston, Singapore and the UK. These include dedicated areas for pharma-only cargo, custom built storage systems for holding chemicals used for sanitization purposes and continuous temperature monitoring systems.</p>

      <p>IATA has recognised the Cargo Community at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol for their contribution, support, and endorsement of its CEIV Pharma Programme.</p>
      <p>"The European freight market is one of the largest in the world, accounting for close to a quarter of total global trade," said Glyn Hughes, IATA's Global head of Cargo.</p>
      <p>"Having Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Europe's third largest freight airport, and Air Cargo Netherlands, one of the region's largest operators, support the CEIV Pharma Programme is a significant boost for meeting shippers' expectations in terms of standardisation and transparency across the supply chain in the region."</p>
      <p>Pharma Gateway Amsterdam (PGA) was formed a year ago with the aim of providing a transparent and qualified pharma air cargo supply chain.</p>
      <p>On becoming a PGA member, organisations are required to become CEIV certified and are provided with support and guidance throughout the process.</p>
      <p>All 13 members of PGA are now working to develop an "early warning system" as a solution for pharma shippers who are asking for clarity in the pharma supply chain.</p>
      <p>"It is through group effort and community initiative that the air cargo industry improves," said Jonas van Stekelenburg, Cargo director at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.</p>
      <p>"It makes perfect sense that all PGA members become IATA CEIV Certified. IATA understands exactly what to look at when assessing the quality of the pharma supply chain, and receiving the accreditation assures our customers that at Schiphol, they are receiving the highest quality service."</p>
      <p>PGA members benefit from cooperative and competitive knowledge sharing, with regular events hosted by members of the Schiphol Community.</p>
      <p>The 13 members of PGA are Cyberfreight, GEFCO, VCK Logistics, Yusen Logistics, Swissport, Dnata, Worldwide Flight Services (WFS), Air France-KLM, De Jong Special Services, Jan de Rijk Logistics, Nouwens Breda, DJ Middelkoop, and SGS.</p>

      <p>The BE-GATE customs platform has been launched to accelerate and increase efficiency of customs clearance for cross-border e-commerce in Belgium.</p>
      <p>The platform was developed on the initiative of the Belgian Customs and Excise Department and is supported by the ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge, and the airports of Brussels and Liege.</p>
      <p>It is designed to process large amounts of data and guarantees rapid clearance of customs applications, with a high number of arrival notifications being transmitted simultaneously via an official customs approved form.</p>
      <p>For shipments of less than €22, the form serves as a declaration of release for consumption, and for all other shipments a declaration in the Belgian customs software paperless solution is required.</p>
      <p>Retailers automatically receive information for shipments that have been selected for customs control, and all other shipments are released immediately.</p>
      <p>Werner Rens, head of marketing department at Belgium Customs and Excise says: "With BE-GATE, we have developed an efficient and effective e-commerce tool that prevents delays in the supply chain due to lack of transparency and communication. A win-win solution that also facilitates our work as a customs authority."</p>
      <p>Steven Verhasselt, vice president commercial at Liege Airport says: "Liege Airport started as a pioneer in full cargo airports about 20 years ago hosting TNT's global air hub. Since then many years of growth have led us to become Europe's 7th biggest cargo airport connected to 12 Chinese cities by air and by rail. The express expertise is now fully deployed to accommodate large e-commerce flows and we expect BE-GATE to further optimise flows at Liege Airport."</p>
      <p>Steven Polmans, director cargo and logistics at Brussels Airport adds: "Brussels Airport offers a global network of both passenger belly hold, express and full cargo aircraft capacity. With our ongoing expansion and new warehouses under construction, we are ready for the growing business of e-commerce. BE-GATE will help us to be an even more attractive entry point for e-commerce thanks to its facilitation and transparency."</p>

      <p>Brussels Airport and Montevideo's MVD Free Airport have signed a memorandum of understanding to continue sharing know-how and best practices to develop new pharma certified lanes between Europe and Latin America.</p>
      <p>A joint statement from Uruguay's MVD Free Airport and Brussels Airport Company said that they both "see eye-to-eye with regards to the challenges that global pharma distribution is facing".</p>
      <p>They have worked on several initiatives including the launching of a GDP compliant route between Brussels and Montevideo to facilitate regional distribution to Brazil, Argentina and the rest of South America via Uruguay.</p>
      <p>"We've felt identified with what Brussels Airport Company has been doing for quite some time" Saidd Bruno Guella, managing director at MVD Free Airport, adding: "The way they've positioned themselves as a pharma gateway with state-of-the-art infrastructure, pharma-oriented processes and internal quality standards up to par with the most demanding has definitely helped shape our mission and vision.</p>
      <p>"We are happy to be in continuous collaboration with Brussels Airport Company and very excited for what is to come."</p>
      <p>Nathan De Valck, cargo development manager at Brussels Airport Company, said: "It is great to see companies such as MVD Free Airport who operate in very challenging regional contexts strive for greatness and help pave the way for a safer, reliable and standardized pharma distribution.</p>
      <p>"When we first started exchanging ideas and information we were very pleasantly surprised to learn we were speaking the same language and that a lot could be accomplished together and also being part of Pharma.Aero as well.</p>
      <p>"Today, we are very satisfied with the road we've travelled and looking forward to all that is yet to come" mentioned. </p>
      <p>MVD Free Airport is a business unit of Corporación America, the largest airport operator in the world with a network of over 50 airports and cargo terminals across three continents. It is a multimodal distribution centre specialised in temperature-controlled supply chain, operating as the first and only free airport in South America.</p>

      <p>RIOgaleão, Rio de Janeiro's international airport, has been awarded IATA's Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Pharma certificate. Certification for the key Brazilian gateway follows a number of audits and assessments, technical training and "significant improvements" to the airport's pharma handling infrastructure and processes, said a spokesperson. Investments at RIOgaleão Cargo have now surpassed $10m since the beginning of the concession in August 2014. Added the spokesperson: "The CEIV Pharma certification confirms RIOgaleão Cargo's compliance with the highest international pharma handling standards and best practices and significantly reduces logistics costs and risks for its clients, cementing its role as a major gateway for pharmaceuticals to and from Latin America." The pharma certification comes after the inauguration last year of the airport's TECA Pharma 2 facility, which tripled cold storage capacity to 17,000 cubic metres at the cargo terminal, offering 1,400 additional pallet positions. The facility features a fully automated cargo storage system and comprises two temperature environments (2° to 8° and 16° to 22° Celsius) as well temperature controlled anterooms and docks. Approximately 25% of RIOgaleão Cargo's revenues are related to temperature controlled pharmaceutical freight, and the airport is the country's main gateway for government vaccination campaigns. Patrick Fehring, director of RIOgaleão Cargo, said: "Airfreight provides the pharmaceutical industry with the speed and efficiency high value and temperature sensitive products require. "Our CEIV Pharma certification demonstrates to our customers that we operate to the highest international standards and it gives us a strong competitive advantage over other airports in the region. "Together with our airport and airline partners we can now offer our pharmaceutical customers a CEIV Pharma certified trade lane, giving them peace of mind from origin to destination."  Carlos Ebner, IATA's director in Brazil, said: "Air transport, nowadays, requires special capabilities for the handling of pharmaceuticals. "CEIV Pharma is a programme that seeks to implement international standards of supply chain management, addressing chain challenges, including the latest achievements in the transportation of pharmaceuticals. "The programme is proof that the air transport industry is truly committed to its challenges and we are very proud of RIOgaleão's CEIV Pharma certification."</p>

      <p>TIACA's new online Cargo Service Quality (CSQ) tool has officially launched, following its successful trial involving nearly 200 air cargo supply chain companies.</p>
      <p>Oman Aviation Services, SATS at Singapore Changi Airport, and Asia Airfreight Terminal in Hong Kong are the most recent Cargo Terminal Operators to enlist in the programme, which aims to improve visibility and facilitate new air cargo global standards.</p>
      <p>Steven Polmans, TIACA vice chairman and Brussels Airport Company head of cargo and logistics says: "This is a prime example of airports leading the way for change in their communities, through embracing an environment of collaboration and visibility. Given the success of the pilot, we are very excited that this TIACA initiative is now being made accessible to the wider industry, and we encourage interested parties to get in touch."</p>
      <p>The online tool is a worldwide campaign by TIACA to set global benchmarking standards for the airfreight industry to adopt, and in turn enhance quality across the chain.</p>
      <p>Sanjiv Edward, chief commercial officer of Delhi International Airport and TIACA board member says: "Momentum behind TIACA's new CSQ tool is rapidly accelerating, and we are currently in advanced talks with dozens more air cargo supply chain companies, from Europe and Africa to Asia and North America, eager to sign up to the programme."</p>
      <p>The CSQ pilot scheme that took place last year involved 179 freight forwarders and 18 cargo terminal operators around the world, including Delhi Indira Gandhi International Airport and AAICLAS Chennai Cargo Terminal in India, Brussels Airport in Belgium, PT Jasa Angkasa Semestra in Indonesia, Hong Kong's Asia Airfreight Terminal, and Singapore Airport Terminal Services amongst others.</p>
      <p>Following completion of the pilot, Kenya Airports Authority pledged to fully adopt CSQ by mid-2019 at all airports across the country.</p>
      <p>The tool is made up of four parts: benchmarking, assessment, improvement and excellence allows cargo terminals to provide ratings on several factors including process, technology, facilities, regulators and general airport infrastructure, amongst other variables.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Hamburg Airport becomes the first German airport to introduce innovative IT system, FAIR@Link, from software developer DAKOSY at its air cargo center.</p>
      <p>This neutral, IT-supported air cargo community system that enables all companies involved in freight handling processes - in particular handling agents, forwarders, truckers and airlines - to optimize and accelerate their transport and freight processes for both import and export. Customs, security, dangerous goods and supply chain management processes are also supported - in many cases even automated.</p>
      <p>The pilot project started at Hamburg Airport Cargo Center on May 6, 2019.</p>
      <p>Alexander Muller, head of Cargo at Hamburg Airport said: "I'm certain that the standardized early data exchange between the process participants made possible by FAIR@Link will create great added value for everyone. The pilot project will provide us with conclusive results for the processes at our air freight center."</p>
      <p>UIrich Wrage, CEO of DAKOSY said: "Through intelligent process support and networking, FAIR@Link provides the ideal basis for further optimizing the physical processes between companies involved in air freight processing and for achieving significantly faster and more transparent processing."</p>
      <p>Introducing this system at the Hamburg Airport Cargo Center will shorten handling and wait times in the air cargo center, increase transparency along the transport chain and also minimize errors and costs by avoiding duplicate entry of data. A particular advantage is that the system prepares the Customs release and can automatically transmit it electronically upon entry into the Hamburg Airport Customs area.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect is the Door Management System: as part of the pilot project, time slots are booked for the delivery of goods to the air freight center. The delivery company as well as the handling partner of the airline can thereby plan coordinated schedules for the delivery of goods. As a result, drivers can reduce wait times on site and dispatchers can more easily plan for necessary capacities. It's also a step towards protecting the environment: digital processes use less paper.</p>
      <p>Pilot project as a cooperation between forwarding agents, dispatchers and Customs authorities</p>
      <p>FAIR@Link will initially be used at Hamburg Airport in a four-month pilot project. In this phase, the project partners will concentrate on export processes. In addition to the initiator Hamburg Airport and the software provider DAKOSY, the project participants include the forwarding agents CROSS FREIGHT, Delta Stallion, a.hartrodt and Sable, the airline handling partners LUG and Swissport, the Hamburg Airport Customs Office and the Hamburg Freight Forwarders Association.</p>

      <p>AS a founding member of IATA's e-freight programme, SAS Cargo has operated e-freight trade lane between Gothenburg and Hong Kong for more than a year. The trade lane Hong Kong-Gothenburg and Stockholm went operational during September 2008 but is now set to cover airfreight to and from Sweden, Norway and Denmark. "The first test shipments have already been sent and Norway is now open for paper-free shipments on domestic, import, export and transfer," said product manager Steen Otterstrøm, SAS Cargo. "Sweden has been paper-free since 2007 and Swedish domestic trade lanes are now in focus for development. In Denmark the authorities have a technical issue in relation to exports, but we will be handling import and transfers as e-freight in Denmark within a very short time." The paper-free shipments are organised in close cooperation with national customs authorities and IATA forwarders like DHL, Schenker, Geodis Wilson, Kuehne + Nagel and Trust Forwarding.  "In Norway alone Trust is processing 3,000 airwaybills a month and estimates claim that in average each airwaybill is handled 60 times during its life span," said Robert Skoog, general manager Trust Forwarding. "Obviously, electronic airwaybills represent a tremendous improvement of our work processes. The paperwork will become much more simple and efficient, when all information needed will be available online."  According to Skoog the customers will also experience advantages from e-freight. He expects the quality to improve when typing errors have been eliminated and airwaybills cannot be mislaid. Furthermore he sees an opportunity for improved feedback as well as quality and performance measures in the interface between IATA's e-freight project and Cargo 2000. With e-freight the transport flow becomes more transparent to all parties involved.</p>

      <p>In a sign of anticipated growth in its pharma vertical, Russian carrier AirBridgeCargo (ABC) is expanding its partnership with temperature-controlled container manufacturer and lessor SkyCell, the two parties announced today in a joint release.</p>
      <p>AirBridgeCargo said its passive pharmaceuticals shipments increased two-fold in the first quarter of 2019, to around 3,500 tonnes year-on-year, boosting demand for containers. SkyCell has previously worked with the carrier, and today's agreement confirms ABC plans to expand the variety of temperature-controlled containers it leases from the Zurich-based company.</p>
      <p>As is typical of many passive container options on the market, Skycell's containers keep internal temperatures low, even when external temperatures are extremely high. The passive container option, maintains internal temperatures "within the range of +2° to +8°C" in normal conditions, and between "+15°C to +25°C under external temperature excursions from -35°C to +65°C," according to SkyCell.</p>
      <p>The containers are also equipped with temperature sensors and data-collection capabilities, which "supports our intention to move further with 'Internet of Things' penetration into the industry and step aside from peer-to-peer data sharing to information transparency and availability," said Fedor Novikov, Deputy General Director, Products, AirBridgeCargo Airlines.</p>
      <p>The move also fits with recent efforts from ABC to more closely tailor pharmaceutical shipments. The company signed on with "internet of things" (IoT) digital avionics firm SITAONAIR last summer to enable real-time temperature monitoring for sensitive pharmaceutical cargo. ABC also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Shanghai Pudong International Airport Cargo Terminal Co., Ltd (PACTL) earlier last year as well, to cooperate on handling services for time- and temperature- sensitive pharma cargo.</p>
      <p>Despite the slowdown in general cargo, carriers have continued to find growth in specialty cargo segments such as pharma cargo. Other carriers too, continue to bolster their pharma handling capabilities. Singapore Airlines (SIA) Cargo and Air France KLM Cargo) recently signed leases with SkyCell earlier this year to improve pharmaceutical shipments, and Cargolux and Emirates SkyCargo signed leases with SkyCargo in 2017.</p>

      <p>DHL Global Forwarding has launched myDHLi Quote &amp; Book, an online service for comparing quotations and making instant bookings for air and ocean freight and even for door-to-door shipments.</p>
      <p>The service guides customers through the "quotation journey", says the company, and enables them to directly compare available options, including DHL Ocean Connect LCL (less-than-container-load) as well as two speeds of air freight, DHL Air Connect and DHL Air Economy. "Users can also book transport insurance for the shipment in just a few clicks."</p>
      <p>The service is now available 24 hours a day, seven days a week at https://quote.mydhli.com in more than 60 countries.</p>
      <p>Tim Scharwath, ceo DHL Global Forwarding, Freight, says it is "the industry's most user-friendly online quotation and booking service. With this new service, we continue our digital transformation with the clear aspiration to become the leading global logistics provider.</p>
      <p>"We listened to our customers' needs and improved upon our prior online tool. We added new features, increased coverage and implemented a highly intuitive user interface to achieve a simple and effective customer experience."</p>
      <p>Transparent air and ocean freight quotes allow customers to compare rates and lead times to select the best option. For air freight, customers can choose between DHL Air Connect, with a typical delivery time of 3-5 days, and DHL Air Economy, a cost effective option that uses alternative carriers and routes to deliver in about 5-7 days. Both booking options cover general cargo up to 2,000 kg per shipment.</p>
      <p>Customers can save quotes, which are valid for 30 days, and share them with selected recipients via e-mail. In addition, customers may request a quote for special cargo, including dangerous goods, lithium batteries and non-stackable cargo, which is provided in a separate email from DHL.</p>

      <p>Tiaca has developed a new online Cargo Service Quality (CSQ) tool as part of its drive launched yesterday to help create standards across the supply chain. The tool will allow participants in the CSQ project to fill out an online cargo quality assessment form either every quarter, or every six months. The tool also provides those that take part with access to a "quality dashboard" that can be customised to users requirements as well as analysis functions that help identify strengths and improvement areas. The overall initiative aims to provide shippers with the ability to view the quality of service delivered by players in air cargo supply chain. The pilot phase of the programme includes assessment tools for airports and cargo terminal operators, and the CSQ will eventually be available to measure other segments of the air cargo supply chain. Tiaca chairman Sanjiv Edward said: "In my interactions with shippers it has been reaffirmed that the lack of visibility and absence of uniform global standards results in air freight business deals being limited by cost considerations, lack of product improvements, and perceived lack of value for money." The programme has received backing from players at leading airports including Hong Kong International Airport, Singapore Changi Airport, New Delhi Airport, Brussels Airport, and Beijing Capital Airport. Tiaca is not the only organisation that has introduced an intelligence hub that aims to improve standards across the supply chain. In September, IATA's Cargo iQ launched a new intelligence hub giving members real-time information on performance and  allowing them to compare themselves against the organisation's standards and the community overall. Cargo iQ also signed an MoU with the Global Shippers' Forum to implement the Cargo iQ quality management system and promote sustainability in airfreight.  The MoU outlines six areas where the two groups will work together towards a more efficient, quality-driven, and secure air cargo supply chain. Read more supply chain news</p>

      <p>Transport software specialist Mercator is offering an Intelligent Cargo Ecosystem, which it describes as the industry's first open API platform for air cargo management and ground handling. APIs (application programming interfaces) are used to provide the 'building blocks' which simplify the task of writing computer programs. Mercator says its open architecture platform enables air cargo carriers to break away from the constraints of legacy systems by allowing handlers and operators to make process changes within the system quickly and flexibly, as well as introduce new services. For example, air cargo carriers will be able to move small consumer packages and perishable goods more effectively by having full visibility into shipment as well as optimizing air cargo management processes to reduce delays. Mercator's chief technology officer, Brendan McKittrick predicted: "Mobile technology and open API platforms will revolutionize the industry, allowing carriers to get a real-time digital view of the entire air cargo supply chain. The technology can really transform the industry, providing much greater visibility, versatility, and above all, the ability to simplify complex and challenging processes." The first applications to be rolled out as part of the Ecosystem is the Warehouse App, which Mercator says was developed after extensive consultation with hundreds of air cargo warehouse agents and through its own experience of processing over 200,000 tons of cargo a day It allows warehouse agents to capture all air cargo data through a single mobile interface and achieve full visibility at every stage of the warehouse management process, from acceptance and relocation, through to breakdown, build-up, delivery, and tracking billing data. A smart search function also allows agents to search and query shipments, display codes and labels, view shipment itineraries and retrieve loading details. After the cargo is scanned, the agent can track an entire shipment or a specific item within a shipment. Finnair Cargo has been one of the first carriers to test and deploy the Warehouse App as part of its efforts to transform its air cargo and ground handling operations. Its vice president head of cargo, Janne Tarvainen, said: "The Warehouse App will be an important tool for years to come. The new mobile and digital system, alongside our investment in a new cargo terminal, will revolutionize Finnair's cargo system for customers and partners."

    <title>Air Cargo Americas: Airports to play increasingly important role in supply chains</title>

      <p>Airports will play an increasingly important role in air cargo supply chains as lead times become increasingly shorter.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Air Cargo Americas event in Miami, Sao Paulo's GRU Airport chief executive Gustavo Figueiredo said that the role of airports in the air cargo has changed completely over the last ten years because supply chains have become increasingly fast, driven by e-commerce and just-in-time production.</p>
      <p>In the past, airports were simply infrastructure providers and a transhipment point, he said, but today they are much more than that.</p>
      <p>"Airports must today provide information in real time, the capability to [consolidate] different shipments from different parts of the world and have the ability to provide the information for the customers to do the last mile directly from the airport.</p>
      <p>"With the e-commerce business we have to work together with the authorities to make it possible to clear the goods as fast as we can because to deliver in one day in a country like Brazil, with such large distances, requires a very smooth and efficient process.</p>
      <p>"Airports have to sit together with the authorities and stakeholders and make it possible."</p>
      <p>Figueiredo added that airports today also had to be flexible when it comes to customer requirements.</p>
      <p>He explained that a big company may want to operate its own hub at the airport, whereas a smaller player may want the airport to provide and operate  cargo handling infrastructure as well as provide value-added services such as assembly.</p>
      <p>"We must have the flexibility to offer a different model for each type of requirement in the supply chain," Figueiredo said.</p>
      <p>"Another thing we see that will change in the future is that with this challenge [of shorter] lead time requirements, from the customer perspective, airports will be an important hub in the supply chain.</p>
      <p>"Companies are trying to reduce the [number of] nodes in their supply chains and airports will be an important place to add more services and activities [currently provided elsewhere in the supply chain] to enable them to reduce lead times and improve the performance of supply chains."</p>
      <p>This view was echoed by Modern Logistics vice president of commercial and marketing Adalberto Febeliano who said that airports must become more a part of global supply chains.</p>
      <p>He gave the example of automotive just-in-time supply chains, suggesting airports could receive parts from several suppliers and then sort them to go to the correct part of the production line rather than do this elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Also in the session, the airline panellists were asked how they are tackling the opportunity presented by e-commerce.</p>
      <p>Amerijet International chief executive Vicken Karjian said that it needed to be close to its customers.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that it can take six months to develop a new product, so it needed to be ahead of the curve in terms of understanding what customers will require.</p>
      <p>Avianca Cargo commercial director Carlos Andres Arango said that it had launched an e-commerce product but added that "for an airline, it is not as easy as it may seem".</p>
      <p>"Avianca had to change the whole process and mentality of cargo [when launching the e-commerce product] because you are not moving general cargo, you are moving small items with high volumes."</p>
      <p>Air Cargo Americas is taking place in Miami from October 29-31</p>

      <p>Kuehne + Nagel (K+N) is to become the air, sea and land logistics partner of pharmaceutical research company Grünenthal and will help the German group reorganise its worldwide transportation network. Grünenthal has production sites in Europe and Latin America and is represented in 32 countries through subsidiaries, while its products are available in 155 countries. It was looking for a logistics partner that could operate on a global scale and meet its demands for reliability and traceability. KN PharmaChain, the Switzerland-headquartered forwarder's multi-modal temperature-controlled door-to-door logistics solution, will be a core element of the network because it allows accurate traceability of the deliveries and "intensive, proactive risk management". K+N recently became the first logistics provider worldwide to receive the IATA CEIV Pharma certification for the KN PharmaChain network covering 86 locations. Grünenthal's senior vice president global supply chain, Victor Barbosa, explained that the new agreement would allow the pharma company "to combine all our global forwarding services with the K+N Group. This centralisation and our partner's expertise in the pharmaceutical industry will help us to make our processes more efficient and enhance our competitiveness." K+N Germany managing director Hansjörg Rodi stated: "Our aim is to reshape the entire network for logistics services together with the customer. To achieve this, we will utilise our expertise in providing services for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, which is of strategic importance for K+N." </p>

      <p>United Airlines and DHL Global Forwarding (DGF) have announced growth and expansion initiatives to serve San Juan, the burgeoning life sciences and pharmaceuticals hub in Puerto Rico. The two companies are working together to increase the number of widebody flights serving San Juan and to offer expanded cold chain storage solutions for temperature-controlled chambers operating at 15 to 25° C (59 to 77° F). United, partly to serve increased demand for temperature-controlled shipments, will from mid-December increase its current one Boeing 777 flight per week to six between San Juan's Luis Munoz Marin airport and the airline's New York/Newark hub. The DHL facility expansion will take place by dividing its current 5,616 sq ft warehouse in San Juan into three independently operated cold chambers with a combined capacity of 324 pallets. Each of the three chambers will have 100% redundant refrigeration systems and also have a hot gas injection system to maintain required relative humidity levels during operation. Frank Cascante, head of sales &amp; marketing for DHL temperature management solutions at DGF, said: "Pharmaceutical companies have increasingly invested in Puerto Rico over the years, and they need a strong global network and cold chain infrastructure to handle their delicate medicines and pharmaceutical products." According to the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Co (PRIDCO), the island has 49 US Food and Drug Administration FDA-approved pharmaceutical plants, while twelve of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies have a presence there. It also is the fifth largest pharmaceutical manufacturing territory in the world and has recently attracted extra cargo services from Cargolux, CAL, American Airlines and IAG. "Building strong, collaborative relationships with United Cargo customers allows us to share innovative ideas and opportunities to ensure we meet the needs of the global health care community," said Jim Bellinder, United Cargo's vice president of sales Americas.  The Air Cargo News Life Sciences and Pharmaceuticals Air Cargo Conference will take place in London this year at the Hilton London Heathrow Airport at Terminal 4 on November 22 and 23.</p>

      <p>In a bid to keep pace with the latest industry technologies and ensuring traceability for customers worldwide, AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) and Sky Fresh have inked a deal on digital procedures for the transportation of time and temperature sensitive shipments.</p>
      <p>The main point of the cooperation is related to cargo acceptance checklists, which were traditionally paper-based and filled in manually in the course of the transportation process. Sky Fresh provides an online web platform to centralise data from all acceptance checklists, with the possibility of monitoring freight movements for time and temperature sensitive shipments at each step of the transportation and the sending of automated notifications to all supply chain stakeholders. Users will be able to complete the checklists via a mobile application on their smartphone or tablet, available either on App Store or Google Play. All corresponding real-time data is visible on the Sky Fresh Web platform, accessible in any browser.</p>
      <p>The agreement provides countless benefits for all parties concerned, as it offers a high level of customisation, transparency of operations, traceability, efficiency and the possibility to take corrective and preventive actions, if needed.</p>
      <p>"It is not every day we see cutting-edge technologies penetrating into the air cargo industry, which makes Sky Fresh an attractive industry and tech-savvy solution. We foresee it propelling the quality of our abcPharma product, bringing it to the next level by eliminating the potential of human error. With environmental considerations high on the agenda of our company, we will contribute by decreasing the number of paper documents and using digitalization instead. It will definitely make the whole process of transportation more transparent, customised and accurate," pointed out Fedor Novikov, global director, Pharma for AirBridgeCargo Airlines.</p>
      <p>"For the first time, Sky Fresh will closely cooperate with ABC. Together, we want to create a digital mindset in the air freight industry, not only through efficiency gains but also by providing real-time data to support strategic decisions and proof of the excellence of ABC," stated Fen Lasseel, business developer manager at Sky Fresh®.</p>
      <p>For the first 10 months of 2017, ABC has reported its highest-ever growth in the volume of pharmaceuticals carried, rising 153 percent year-of-year, which illustrates ABC's commitment to the industry and the airline's efforts in developing solutions for special cargoes. The airline achieved IATA CEIV Pharma certification at the end of 2016, Envirotainer QEP accreditation for certain online stations in 2017, and is training a pool of home-grown specialists in time and temperature sensitive cargo solutions and networking in order to stay in touch with the latest innovations in the air cargo industry.</p>

      <p>Swiss freight forwarding and logistics company Kuehne + Nagel (K+N) continues its efforts to advance supply chain management this week, announcing plans to open 'innovation centers' in Utrecht and Singapore. Both facilities will serve as "sandboxes to test and rapidly rollout new technologies," where K+N will work with universities and start-ups to develop automated supply chain solutions.</p>
      <p>The Utrecht location will focus on developing automation and picking technologies, a venture it has pursued in partnership with Dutch parts manufacturer Universal Robots. The Singapore facility will focus on utilizing data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT) to integrate digitization into logistics management—this following the company's establishment of its first control center in the North Asia Pacific region in December.</p>
      <p>These developments come in the wake of K+N's release of its international supply chain management software, KN ESP earlier this week. Gianfranco Sgro, a member of the managing board of K+N International AG noted that, "the market for contract logistics services is transforming substantially due to the effects of digitalization. With the innovation centers we invest in research and new technologies to accelerate this transformation."</p>

      <p>Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad signed an agreement with digital airfreight booking platform cargo.one at an air cargo conference today, confirming Etihad as the latest carrier to join the multi-airline e-booking platform. For Etihad, the move advances its efforts in digitalizing its operations and for cargo.one grows the network of carriers and destinations available to its freight forwarding customers.</p>
      <p>Following a phased roll-out starting today, freight forwarders will soon be able to book Etihad's capacities on the cargo.one platform. Freight forwarders can create and log into an online account, accessible via desktop or tablet 24/7, to request bookings for shipments with instant confirmation.</p>
      <p>Using the platform, freight forwarders can fill out a shipment request's origin airport, destination airport, drop-off date and date of arrival. Once entered, the cargo.one system will process the information and immediately provide a list of booking options that customers can view and select from. Once a booking has been accepted, the platform will send a confirmation to the freight forwarder that can be shared with colleagues and customers.</p>
      <p>The cargo.one booking platform also allows for the input of specific data related to shipments, such as dimensions, weight, number of pieces and whether a shipment is stackable or turnable. Inputting the data before requesting shipment services helps not only filter available options but is also intended to improve the quality of the shipping service. Customers will also be also be able to see all the past bookings of a given station and can cancel or update their order should needs change. This allows for clear communication with the carrier that can then adjust loading plans or utilize the space for other shipments.</p>
      <p>Customers will initially be able to book general cargo onboard Etihad's main deck utilizing either the carrier's standard or express services. In the future, forwarders may be able to send perishable and other specialized cargo shipments, depending on feedback from future market studies, according to cargo.one.</p>
      <p>By joining the platform, Etihad intends to reduce manual distribution efforts as well as continue its expansion into the European market by accessing cargo.one's global user base of over 300 freight forwarding companies. The move further advances Etihad's digitalization initiative, which includes the carrier's recent opening of its high-tech Cargo Control Center.</p>
      <p>"Etihad Cargo's ambition to lead the industry into a new digital era has driven significant investment in our digitalisation programme across back of house and customer facing platforms in the last 12 months," said Abdulla Mohamed Shadid, Etihad Aviation Group's managing director of cargo and logistics services. The partnership with cargo.one "builds on the success we have achieved on our own online platform, etihadcargo.com, which now represents 38% of our bookings."</p>
      <p>Other carriers that have signed on to cargo.one's booking platform so far this year include Nippon Cargo, El Al Cargo, Finnair Cargo, Lufthansa Cargo, AirBridgeCargo and CargoLogicAir.</p>
      <p>"With Etihad, we've brought on another big network carrier and are now able to serve all continents," cargo.one managing director Moritz Claussen told Air Cargo World in an interview. "We're adding 33 more destinations worldwide than we had in our network with our previous partner carriers and in the future are looking to add more."</p>
      <p>cargo.one concluded by sharing that five more carriers are in the process of integrating their networks with the company's platform and that these carriers will be announced in the coming weeks and months.</p>

      <p>Wisskirchen Handling Services is to start using logistics IT provider  topsystem's Electronic Cargo Handling &amp; Operations System (ECHOS) at its multifunctional cargo centre at Cologne/Bonn Airport from June 2018. "Wisskirchen opted for ECHOS in a bid to improve client connectivity, make our quality more measurable and verifiable, and enhance efficiency through increasing automation and eliminating the use of paper," said Wisskirchen managing director Oliver Hellwig. topsystem said that the modular, web-based airfreight handling system is paperless and covers the entire chain of airside and landside processes, including cargo management, with all information sent in real time for further processing via ECHOS. Any discrepancies in documentation result in instant alerts, enabling swift action. Using ECHOS, employees are able to monitor and manage stock movement within the cargo processing area on mobile devices, while also going through checklists for the handling of hazardous goods. The system also features an integrated resource planning and management program that optimises the deployment of staff. Wisskirchen will also implement mECHOS, the system's mobile app, at its Cologne cargo facility. The app guides employees through their workflow and eliminates paper documents. topsystem added that mECHOS will also help to reduce error rates in the handler's warehouse. Wisskirchen is also planning to deploy the software elsewhere in Germany. Germany-based topsystem has been developing process optimisation systems for the aviation and logistics sectors since 1995.</p>

      <p>EMIRATES SKYCARGO has cemented its position as one of the major players in the pharmaceuticals and healthcare market with the launch of an environmentally-friendly, temperature-controlled LD3 air cargo container, writes Thelma Etim, deputy editor.</p>
      <p>The carrier invested two years in researching and developing its White Container, which keeps temperature-sensitive shipments cool when transported both on the ground and in the air.</p>
      <p>Designed with generic healthcare products and food perishables in mind, the thermal insulated box uses coolant trays allowing handlers to add or replenish dry ice or coolants without disturbing the packaging, says a company statement.</p>
      <p>It can be used for shipments requiring temperature ranges between 2°C – 8°C and 5°C – 25°C and is a reliable solution for time- and temperature-sensitive cargoes that do not fall into the very high sensitive category, it adds.</p>
      <p>"The White Container is an affordable option and does not replace our high-end Cool Chain Premium solution. Instead it offers an intermediate solution that is cost effective for commodities, such as generic healthcare products and food perishables," reveals Moaza Al Falahi, Emirates' vice-president of cargo product development and local affairs.</p>
      <p>"This in-house developed solution is simple but efficient and has no backhaul issues. We are the only air cargo operator to offer this specific solution and along with our other offerings such as active temperature controlled containers, warehouses, cool dollies and white covers, we are at the forefront in offering a comprehensive portfolio of cool chain solutions for all types of time and temperature-sensitive cargo," she adds.    </p>
      <p>SkyCargo's cool chain products include: Cool Chain Premium, Cool Chain Advanced and Cool Chain Basic.</p>
      <p>The carrier has expanded its temperature controlled handling capacity with the opening of its freighter terminal at Dubai World Central's (DWC) Al Maktoum International Airport, where it has an advanced storage system and a perishables area designed to handle 140,000 tonnes of cargo annually. The facility also boasts three large areas, each with different temperature ranges between 18°C to 25°C.</p>

    <content>
      <p>LATAM Cargo Group recently opened in Guarulhos, Brazil, its $3.5 million perishable hub, a controlled-temperature cooler facility that will protect the quality and freshness of perishable products while en route to other destinations in South America, North America and Europe.</p>
      <p>The company has gained recognition for its expertise transporting fresh products, which account for 45% of all goods carried during a year. In this context, Guarulhos occupies a place of relevance because 85% of all cargo connecting is perishable. This, together with the strategic decision to position Guarulhos as the Group's main hub, explains the reasons behind the company's decision to make the multi-million dollar investments.</p>
      <p>The facility occupies an area of 1,637 sq m, of which 50% are equipped with variable temperature cooling chambers that offer refrigeration ranges of 0 to 2 °C and 2 to 12 °C for storage and re-palletising. The system also gives the option of raising the temperature of any of the chambers up to 22 °C. Thanks to the new perishable hub, the LATAM Group has increased its perishable storage capacity at Guarulhos by 33%.</p>
      <p>"Our new cooler is a clear example of our commitment to be strategic partners for our customers. We know Latin America is a major producer and exporter of perishables, and that its economic development largely depends on the international recognition of the quality of its products. Faced with this reality, and as the leader in air transportation in the region, we took on the challenge of providing excellence in service and execution, and investing in leading-edge infrastructure to protect the freshness of the products carried, with the high standards our value proposal is well known for," commented Andrés Bianchi, CEO of the LATAM Cargo Group.</p>

      <p>Topsystem Systemhaus has won a contract to supply Wisskirchen Handling Services with its Electronic Cargo Handling &amp; Operations System (ECHOS) at the cargo centre of Cologne/Bonn Airport.</p>
      <p>Wisskirchen will be using the system from June 2018 at the multifunctional cargo centre in Cologne, where it combines the functions of an airfreight handling terminal and forwarding hub under one roof.</p>
      <p>The end-to-end solution supports all stages of airfreight handling workflow and covers the entire chain of processes between airside and landside and back, including the management of inbound and outbound cargo, with all information sent in real time via ECHOS.</p>
      <p>Document handling staff are notified in the event of discrepancies and using ECHOS, employees are able to monitor and manage stock movement within the cargo processing area on mobile devices, while also going through checklists for the handling of hazardous goods.</p>
      <p>Featuring an integrated resource planning and management programme, the software optimises the deployment of staff, based on the data analysed, and the airfreight handling system captures all the processes digitally with no paper needed.</p>
      <p>Wisskirchen managing director, Oliver Hellwig says: "Wisskirchen opted for ECHOS in a bid to improve client connectivity, make our quality more measurable and verifiable, and enhance efficiency through increasing automation and eliminating the use of paper."</p>
      <p>Wisskirchen will also be using the system's mobile app, mECHOS at the Cologne cargo centre to guide employees every step of the way, providing instructions on what to do next, storage locations, build-up and other tasks to be performed.</p>
      <p>Topsystem says mECHOS will allow Wisskirchen staff to go about their work without the need for paper documents.</p>
      <p>It will also support the use of measurement peripherals as the app covers all warehouse areas, and employees will be able to focus on their main tasks, helping reduce error rates in the warehouse.</p>

      <p>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol has welcomed its first shipment as part of a pilot programme to streamline and secure Customs procedures between China and the European Union (EU).</p>
      <p>The shipment was from Shanghai and the World Customs Organization (WCO) Customs to Customs pilot project called Smart and Secure Trade Lanes (SSTL) aims to reduce lead times and Customs procedures, and increase security in the supply chain through data sharing.</p>
      <p>Schiphol is the only European airport chosen to take part in the pilot, which makes use of an encrypted data exchange platform developed and maintained by the WCO.</p>
      <p>The project has already reduced clearance times and increased predictability in the maritime supply chain through close cooperation between Customs in countries including China, the Netherlands, Spain and Poland.</p>
      <p>The first import SSTL shipment arrived at Schiphol in December, and was flown by Air China Cargo and booked by Yusen Logistics, one of the participants in the SSTL programme.</p>
      <p>Yusen Logistics regional managing director for Northern Europe, Piet Boogaard says: "This is an important pilot programme, which will help reduce lead times and further secure the supply chain, and we are pleased to be taking part.</p>
      <p>As well as benefiting from faster release of goods and more predictable delivery times, we are proud to be supporting the development of standards that will strengthen and secure supply chains."</p>
      <p>The Customs authorities of countries participating in SSTL are working together to recognise and make use of each other's inspection findings, share risk information, and develop secure communication channels to achieve this.</p>
      <p>The first airfreight shipment under the SSTL project was delivered from Schiphol to Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou last May.</p>
      <p>Schiphol cargo business development director, Saskia van Pelt says: "We are glad that Dutch Customs is participating in this pilot project as this strengthens our ties with Shanghai Pudong International airport, our largest cargo destination, as well as Baiyun airport, home base of China Southern airlines.</p>
      <p>"The delivery of cockpit instruments in Baiyun was on its way to a nearby aircraft manufacturer within 21 minutes of landing on Chinese soil, and once there it immediately entered the production process."</p>
      <p>Until recently the project focused solely on maritime freight flows but the scope has now been extended to air transport and more SSTL flight routes are expected to follow between Schiphol and Baiyan.</p>

      <p>Freight forwarder Crane Worldwide Logistics is set to reveal a new customer IT portal following on from the opening of its latest office and warehouse at London Heathrow. The US-headquartered company, which began its UK and Ireland operations in 2009, yesterday held an opening ceremony to celebrate the opening of its new 3,150 sq m facility in Heathrow that will offer increased warehouse space, e-commerce support, pick and pack operations and labelling. "Having outgrown our current premises, the new facility at Heathrow enables us to build upon our existing capabilities and allows the team to provide further value added services to our portfolio," said Crane Worldwide Logistics country manager UK and Ireland Jason Stretton. Stretton said the company's growth, which comes in difficult market conditions, is down to investment in its sales team and a focus on specific vertical markets including, aerospace, automotive, retail and energy. With regards to the expansion of its sales team, Gerard Ryan regional vice president Europe, Middle East and Africa said the UK business had just hired five sales people and a sales director and was also looking to recruit in the Midlands and the London market. It has also formed close partnerships with Middle Eastern carriers in order to secure freighter capacity and worked closely with customers to create bespoke solutions while being able to offer a global network. The company was also continuing to expand globally and has also just opened an office in Vietnam and is considering opening a facility in Saudi Arabia. As well as its investment in people and new offices, the company is also looking to roll out a new IT system. "Over the last 18 months we have invested significantly in our new technology products and they are really going to be a game changer not just for ourselves but also for our customers," Stretton said. President and chief executive John Magee added: "I am confident that in 2017 we will have technology that our industry doesn't even think about and we are not done yet, that is just the progress we have made over the last 18 months." A new purchase order (PO) management system is due to be released over the next quarter. Stretton said the PO system will provide visibility down to the part number, offer landed cost analysis and vendor management. And by the end of the year the company will also release a new customer dashboard portal, currently in a testing phase, that will allow users to drill into the details of each dashboard. The portal can be used on mobile devices as well as desktop computers and offers track and trace, exception reporting, on-time performance and spend management dashboards.</p>

      <p>The IAG Cargo/Exelsius Good Distribution Practice (GDP) Academy formally took off from Heathrow this week when the two organisations launched their initial joint training workshop. Aimed at improving industry compliance to GDP standards for Healthcare and Life Science products, the two-day course was attended by 17 students from the UK, Eire and mainland Europe, including Russia. It offered a combination of both classroom training and an airport airside visit to the IAG Cargo Constant Climate Centre. Participants came from forwarders, logistic service providers, pharmaceutical companies and airlines, with students being awarded a certificate of completion to the required standard. Tony Wright, chief executive of Exelsius, said: "The course programme was designed to provide students with an understanding of the compliance needs of GDP from a truly end–to-end perspective and uses many interactive methods of teaching. Demand was high and we added two additional places to the course to meet that requirement." One participant was Gavin Newman, operations director of Pinnacle International Freight, who also recommended the course to the QA manager and compliance officer at his client, Bio Products Laboratory Said Newman: "The course was a great way to further enhance knowledge and experience of GDP compliance. I appreciated the method of training and open discussions that allowed questions to be explored. It provided an excellent foundation upon which to develop better processes and covered all aspects of GDP." Both IAG Cargo and Exelsius expect to extend the GDP Academy with further courses planned for the UK, Europe and Asia. Alan Dorling, global head of pharmaceutical and life sciences at IAG, said: "We were very pleased with the outcome of this first workshop and are looking to provide our customers in Europe, India and Singapore with the same high level of GDP education in this highly important sector."

      <p>Panalpina Brazil has made a significant investment in its warehouse in Cajamar, São Paulo, as part of its strategy to improve its cold chain logistics solutions in the country.</p>
      <p>The warehouse is now exclusively dedicated to the cold chain market, with the capability to store various types of temperature-controlled cargo, such as medicines and cosmetics as well as food and perishables.</p>
      <p>The 4,000 sq metre facility has three cold chambers. The first is set to -20°C; the second to temperatures ranging from 2°C to 8°C; and the third, and largest, covers temperatures from 15°C to 25°C.</p>
      <p>The warehouse has 10 docks for loading and unloading products, approximately 1,500 pallet positions and an area for services, such as packaging, labelling, kitting and repacking.</p>
      <p>Panalpina Brazil also offers national and international logistics for temperature-controlled cargo. Logistics director Marcelo Tonet says. "Our transport and distribution network was fully revamped and today it has a much broader scope with nationwide coverage and international connections. For deliveries in Brazil, we also use domestic air freight. Both our air and road subcontractors are able to handle any type of temperature-controlled cargo in a fully compliant manner."</p>
      <p>Tonet also highlights theSmartview monitoring system adopted by the company, which allows customers to monitor, in real time, the cargo temperature and humidity using sensors and radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology installed at strategic locations.</p>

      <p>CEVA Logistics believes its investment in high-speed e-commerce fulfilment centres and specific e-commerce transport solutions is helping it win new business around the world.</p>
      <p>"Our strong IT integration capabilities dovetail logistics with the online world in a way which really works for the customer," said Laurent Binetti, CEVA's chief commercial officer.</p>
      <p>"Speed is everything in this business and you must be able to design and run networks which deliver optimised costs and fast lead-times."</p>
      <p>The company has recently expanded its e-commerce services with the implementation and go-live of significant new business wins in the UK, Turkey, USA, Canada and Brazil.</p>
      <p>CEVA's eFulfilment centres rely on its dense global network which serve next-day or even same day delivery.</p>
      <p>It says its e-commerce solutions are designed to enable its customers to successfully sell over the internet by optimising their supply chains for the digital age.</p>
      <p>In the past, B2B and B2C supply chains were separate flows of goods for the last mile. Now, it is a key to modern omni-channel ecosystems to combine the two worlds.</p>
      <p>CEVA has experience in both sectors and global services for industry leading clients serving retail stores and end-consumers.</p>
      <p>Niels Weithe, CEVA's global head of e-commerce, says: "Shipping from China to a consumer in London in four days for a reasonable price is one of the products we see a very strong demand for moving forward.</p>
      <p>"The general shift of logistics volume into e-commerce, the omni-channel integration requiring new warehousing and last mile solutions, and the globalisation of eCommerce are the most relevant challenges for a logistics services provider.</p>
      <p>"These are the areas where we invest heavily. As part of that, we see many more heavy and bulky goods are sold online and require special handling. As an expert in this sector, we'll continue to expand our client base in this field too."</p>

      <p>Initiatives by Singapore ground handler SATS to streamline cargo pallet handling, and a warehouse reorganisation to reduce processing time were among projects singled out for praise by Singapore's transport minister Josephine Teo. There was also ministerial praise for a cargo track and trace scheme by forwarder DB Schenker. The Aviation Productivity Conference, organised by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), highlighted 16 projects that had significantly boosted productivity. SATS mapped the flow of pallets between import and export teams at different terminals. Previously, the import team passed empty pallets to the export team unsorted between different airlines, but it was difficult to sort them at the export terminal because of the lack of space. Instead, as the import terminal had more space, sorting was done here instead. SATS also reconfigured its import warehouse to cut processing time by relocating the delivery point and freeing up existing cargo breakdown areas, modifying forklift trucks and increasing the number of work stations to achieve a 63 per cent reduction in the man hours needed to break down pallets and containers. DB Schenker zoned its warehouse into different areas according to the freight's destination, marked by a barcoded sign read by long-distance hand scanners to record the movement of shipments around the warehouse. The time needed to find and pick cargo was cut by 30 per cent, while the number of queries related to cargo movement was slashed by half.

      <p>Cargocast, a new digital cargo platform, backed by Tigers Global, has been launched for freight forwarders, airlines, and ground handlers to get hands-free visibility of cargo and automate their warehouse operations has been launched. These capabilities drive improvements in quality, utilisation, and door-to-door time while significantly reducing costs.</p>
      <p>Cargocast tracks each cargo piece using radio-frequency identification (RFID), pinpointing cargo in a warehouse within a two-foot radius. Using this location data, processes that previously required human interaction, such as goods acceptance, can be fully automated, which helps prevent errors and increase efficiency. Additionally, providers can leverage this highly accurate data set to improve their efficiency and identify problems quickly.</p>
      <p>Cargocast has also launched an innovation lab in Atlanta, Georgia where they perform development and industry participants can see their solution live.</p>
      <p>Cargocast is led by CEO Dan Diephouse, who brings more than 15 years of expertise running enterprise software businesses, most recently at MuleSoft. "We have developed proprietary processes and technology that leverage the latest advances in RFID to achieve levels of accuracy that were never before possible," said Diephouse. "This is a gamechanger for companies looking to build a strategic advantage in the air cargo industry."</p>
      <p>Diephouse is joined by Mike Morey, an industry veteran and former director of cargo for Air Canada. "Everyone knows that real-time, piece-level tracking is the future, but very few companies have been able to get there without a massive rip and replacement of their existing systems and processes," he said. "Cargocast makes piece-level tracking possible, while also delivering cost savings and working with customers' existing legacy systems."</p>
      <p>"Digitisation of cargo operations is non-optional if logistics providers want to meet the quality and speed needs of today's shippers," said Diephouse. "Cargocast is the only solution that can make cargo a truly digital asset, opening up new possibilities around visibility, automation, and optimisation."</p>

      <p>IAG Cargo and Exelsius, the international cold chain management consultancy, have teamed up again to provide the healthcare and life science industry with a certificated training workshop in Good Distribution Practices (GDP). Exelsius and IAG Cargo, the freight arm of British Airways and Iberia, can offer training to pharmaceutical manufacturers, logistic service providers, ground handlers and all others involved in the cool chain process.    The course allows students to combine classroom training in the correct handling of temperature sensitive pharmaceutical products by air with a 'live' visit to the IAG Cargo Constant Climate Centre at Heathrow. During this visit, participants can witness the handling processes used by IAG Cargo for its Constant Climate product and meet the operational team that handles pharmaceutical and life science shipments to GDP standards. Scheduled for May 11-12, the course will be of significant interest to all stakeholders in the logistics supply chain for temperature-sensitive healthcare products.  With a limited class size demand is expected to be high – register through the Exelsius web site www.exelsiusglobal.com Exelsius chief executive Tony Wright said: "The continued need for education and awareness of Good Distribution Practices in the pharmaceutical supply chain has been highlighted by the UK MHRA decision that all parties involved in the storage and handling of products – either Controlled Room temperature or Refrigerated – will require a Wholesaler Dealer Licence in order to comply with the Human Medicines Regulations.   "This inevitably means an extended audit process that will include verification that staff have been properly trained." Wright adds: "With new products coming on line including personalised medicines that require an even more exacting supply chain, the need for fully trained staff to meet the European Union's GDP requirements, for example, is even more vital. "This course takes an holistic look at the pharma supply chain with a particular focus on the air cargo sector and combines classroom understanding with practical airport operations."</p>

      <p>Shippers and logistics suppliers must share information to build a more secure and efficient pharma supply chain, delegates were told at the Cool Chain Association's 6th Pharma and Biosciences Conference in Brussels, Belgium.</p>
      <p>Cool chain partners must come out of their data silos to ensure the best service in a rapidly evolving pharma landscape, where patients expect tailored products to be delivered to their door, or even administered by a nurse.</p>
      <p>UPS vice president and managing director for healthcare in Europe, Niels van Namen says: "There will be a differentiated future – a much broader range of products, a natural split between the very cheap accessible products in the local supermarket and very personal products which are very high value."</p>
      <p>He adds there will be a range of delivery channels, with UPS already delivering to the patient at home, and the new normal could be the delivery driver is also the nurse giving the injection.</p>
      <p>"We need to have a physical infrastructure knitted together to make sure the product ends up with the patient, at home, at work, or in the hospital, safely, securely, and in the right condition."</p>
      <p>Pharma experts taking part in the two-day discussion agreed that the cool chain is improving but the fear of sharing information and embracing new ideas was an issue.</p>
      <p>Logistics expert Yoram Eshel says: "Each part of the chain is doing much better in its own area, but the chain is not there yet, we are not good at sharing information. Information must be shared between regulators, pharma agencies, forwarders, and all parts of the supply chain so that everyone can learn and improve."</p>
      <p>He added that companies must not be afraid to share information, saying the pharma industry together with logistics stakeholders need to work together to improve product integrity.</p>
      <p>Sessions also focused on facilities, insurance, security, and the benefits of Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) and Good Distribution Practice (GDP) certification, with delegates saying certificates could be essential.</p>
      <p>Worldwide Flight Services vice president planning North America, Ringzing Wangyal says: "It is important that we are transparent just as the disruptors are and we should learn from them. Within three or four years all the paper will be gone, and we should focus on this and not fight against e-cargo."</p>
      <p>Cool Chain Association chairman, Stavros Evangelakakis says the focus should be on the last mile, saying: "As an industry, starting from the shipper all the way to the patient we should also think about the challenges faced by the people delivering on the last mile through jungles and up mountains."</p>
      <p>He adds: "There are thousands of preventable deaths of infants under five years old every day and we should be part of the solution."</p>

      <p>Cargo handlers Frankfurt Cargo Services (FCS) and LUG aircargo handling operating at Europe's leading hub Frankfurt Airport (FRA) are introducing mandatory slot bookings for trucks delivering and picking up air freight at their facilities in FRA's CargoCity South.</p>
      <p>This was decided in cooperation with airport operator Fraport AG and the Freight Forwarding &amp; Logistics Association of the States of Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate (SLV).</p>
      <p>This system comes in response to the long waiting times for freight carriers experienced in late 2017, caused by high cargo traffic at FRA.</p>
      <p>Starting May 15, only trucks that have booked in advance a loading or unloading slot online using the airport's Fair@Link Door Management System will be allowed to drive to the loading docks operated by FCS and LUG. Drivers who have not given advance notice must use a computer terminal to register on site. However, they may have to wait before receiving an allocated slot.</p>
      <p>Thorsten Hölser, managing director, SLV said: "The situation in the last quarter of 2017 made it clear that all parties involved in the process need to work together to solve the problem."</p>
      <p>An important step is the use of a dock management system like the one already utilised by FCS and LUG. Since recently, the two companies have been also been using the same compatible software. Anne Smirr, Head of Sales and Marketing at FCS, explained: "Our experience shows that tangible improvements of process can only be achieved with the participation of all parties involved across the board." In view of steadily rising freight volumes, the new system will help ensure efficient cargo handling in the future.</p>
      <p>Patrik Tschirch, LUG CEO remarked: "Easier planning of the processes allows us to make more efficient use of resources and deliver greater reliability."</p>
      <p>Many of the shipping companies and freight carriers at CargoCity South are already familiar with the Fair@Link dock management system. For all companies that have not yet registered for the Fair@Link system, there is a slimmed-down version available free of charge.</p>
      <p>Felix Kreutel, SVP Cargo at Fraport AG, noted: "By exchanging data digitally through Fair@Link, we have already been pursuing the goal of speeding up the processes in the CargoCities for some time now. This initiative by LUG and FCS will bring us a major step closer."</p>
      <p>To ensure that the initial registration process runs smoothly, registration must be made through the provider of the dock management system, Dakosy. Due to data protection regulations, this is also necessary to use the free version of the system.</p>

      <p>Patrik Tschirch, MD and CEO of LUG aircargo handling GmbH, has been appointed to lead the expanded LUG network since September 1.</p>
      <p>In his new role, he is responsible for the stations in Frankfurt/Main, Munich, and Hamburg as well as for the further deveopment of the network idea. As a result, he has also assumed overall responsibility for sales and all sales relevant topics at all three locations.</p>
      <p>While, Nina Strippel, so far COO, heads the management of the Frankfurt station effective September 1. She reports directly to Patrik Tschirch, as do Christopher Frank for Munich and Dr. Jurgen Vogt for Hamburg.</p>
      <p>In a recent move, the company announced these major restructure of management posts with the aim to raise agility and responsiveness to changes and challenges in the dynamic air cargo industry and remain competitive.</p>
      <p>"I am convinced that there is a lot of potential in an even closer cooperation between the three LUG stations. We want to offer airlines a one-stop-service for professional airfreight logistics with three stations in Germany We have not yet leveraged all synergies and taken advantage of the increasing digitalisation of our industry," explains Patrik Tschirch.</p>
      <p>"The future belongs to network organisations with entrepreneurially independent units that respect the same values, principles, and rules, and operate to equivalent standards. A selective expansion of services and optimization of infrastructure will further strengthen this network. LUG is currently extending its Health Care Center (HCC) in Frankfurt by a further 190 square metre and driving forward the TAPA B certification of the Munich station. Both projects are due to be completed by the end of 2018."</p>

      <p>Imagine if you could accurately predict when and where your largest airfreight shipments will be sent each day. That futuristic ability may soon become available to a wide range of forwarders and shippers with Alibaba Cloud's new artificial intelligence (AI) platform, called  PAI 2.0, which provides businesses and organizations machine-learning capabilities.</p>
      <p>The platform, which launched in 2015, has been upgraded with a much more user-friendly interface to "help customers easily deploy large-scale data mining and modeling," Alibaba Cloud said in a statement. Participating companies can collect information, discern patterns in data and adapt to new input without explicit programming.</p>
      <p>The new 2.0 version of the PAI suite of tools and algorithms "allows businesses without an AI background to make practical use of Alibaba Cloud's ET program."</p>
      <p>Alibaba Cloud's chief scientist, Jingren Zhou, explained that PAI 2.0 will be "an effective tool for helping people and businesses resolve practical issues." He added that Alibaba's technology would reduce development costs and entry barriers to AI.</p>
      <p>Some features of PAI 2.0 include more than 100 sets of algorithms that can be applied to tasks, such as data pre-processing, statistical analysis and deep-learning AI solutions.</p>
      <p>PAI's visual user interface also allows customers to drag and drop components into workflows, meaning that non-experts can handle complex business analytics functions with minimal training.</p>
      <p>Alibaba Cloud said it is aiming first at China's healthcare and manufacturing sectors with its new technology.</p>

      <p>Worldwide Flight Services has invested €10 million in a Pharma Centre at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, making it the only ground handler to own a pharma facility at CDG.</p>
      <p>The pharma centre offers both landside and airside acceptance capabilities and will be fully GDP compliant when it opens in September.</p>
      <p>It will also be IATA CEIV Pharma certified as part of a Groupe ADP initiative within the airport's cargo community.</p>
      <p>The 2,400 m2 dedicated space, located in the heart of CDG airport's cargo area has its own docks and manoeuvring area for loading and unloading of temperature-controlled pharmaceutical shipments.</p>
      <p>Dedicated rooms are provided for loose cargo storage at 15-25C, a cold room at 2-8C, a freezing room and two temperature-controlled areas for 2-25C to store unit load devices.</p>
      <p>WFS is also investing in digital technology systems with the warehouse management system supporting the use of barcode scanning for real-time storage capacity monitoring and management.</p>
      <p>A temperature monitoring solution with a Cloud platform will collect temperature and humidity data in real-time via sensors, accessible on mobile devices.</p>
      <p>Hugo Rodrigues, vice president cargo France at WFS says: "At a major air cargo gateway like Paris CDG, we believe it is incumbent on ground handlers to invest in the right equipment to handle pharma products. Once again, this demonstrates WFS' willingness to invest in new, state-of-the-art facilities when we see opportunities to benefit our customers and our own business."</p>

      <p>WCA's Time Critical Network has now validated all its members to its internal standard for companies operating within the movement and execution of urgent, time sensitive logistics. The forwarder group said accreditation would allow it to compete at international level. The Group's global partners can now fully validate trade lanes to ensure that shipments are handled with maximum efficiency and within the required time frames. General manager, Adam McKenna, said: "It took hard work and determination from our members to reach this point, and in order to keep this status, all future members will undergo a comprehensive validation exam as part as their application process." Companies applying for membership must have gained considerable experience and expertise in time critical logistics. Criteria include 24-hour availability of logistics staff including an emergency contact person; speedy and accurate response to customer requirements; clear and accurate lines of communication – especially out of office hours; and offering the quickest possible transit times at the most cost effective price. Domestic partners need to operate a modern fleet of live satellite controlled vehicles which can be dedicated and double manned for optimum delivery times and members must have direct access to some of the quickest airfreight options. All WCA Time Critical members must be local or regional logistics companies with good reputations in their industry specific operations.</p>

      <p>dnata, cargo handler, has obtained IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) certification at Dubai World Central (DWC).</p>
      <p>The company's Dubai International (DXB) facility has already been certified by IATA for CEIV Pharma.</p>
      <p>The pharma handling processes have been certified at both DXB and DWC demonstrating 'the company's ability to move pharmaceutical products under the strictest standards across its operations in the UAE'.</p>
      <p>The DXB and DWC facilities are equipped with the latest technologies, according to dnata.</p>
      <p>The cold storage areas in the cargo centres are modular, enabling teams to manage changing handling demands with dedicated climate control capability. Web-based monitoring systems are also in place to facilitate real-time management of all areas, added the company.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, to ensure seamless delivery of temperature-sensitive goods from the warehouse to the aircraft, dnata launched 'cool dollies' in its operations.</p>
      <p>In recent years dnata has significantly invested in infrastructure and equipment to enhance its pharma handling capabilities.</p>
      <p>The company's facilities at both DXB and DWC were designed with flexibility and unique product handling requirements in mind, taking advantage of the latest technologies.</p>

      <p>Uruguay's Montevideo Free Airport has achieved IATA's CEIV Pharma Certification. The airport's cargo operation has set itself up to resemble a third party logistics provider (3PL) offering a tax-exemption regime, multimodal transport, and primary and secondary packaging, all located within the airport free zone.</p>
      <p>MVD Free Airport recently inaugurated the first module of its temperature controlled warehousing master plan and is currently working on the executive project of phase 2, as well as revamping its information systems to automate all data capturing and processing stages for real-time process mapping.</p>
      <p>"The IATA CEIV Pharma Certification has made the organisation align itself behind a very challenging objective, and has truly been a learning experience," says MVD Free Airport managing director Bruno Guella. "We are proud to achieve this certification and look forward to keep raising the bar in pharmaceutical distribution in Latin America."</p>
      <p>Last year, MVD Free Airport saw its pharma cargo in transit to other markets in South America grow 462 percent compared with 2016. Some global pharma companies have even started centralising purchase orders at MVD, allowing for smarter stock management and just-in-time replenishment based on having safety stocks for the entire region at MVD.</p>
      <p>"Understanding the implications in the distribution of pharmaceutical products in the region, our entire organisational strategy is based first and foremost on a company culture that thinks 'patient first', and secondly, on taking the necessary steps in training, infrastructure development and information systems that allow for a total quality approach to our day-to day operations," Guella continues.</p>

      <p>Panalpina is boosting its presence in Kenyan flower logistics by acquiring a majority stake in Airflo from the Dutch Flower Group (DFG), the world's largest flower and plant trader. The acquisition, subject to conditions, reflects Switzerland-based Panalpina's continued expansion in Africa and its increasing focus on the perishables business. Peter Ulber, Panalpina's chief executive, said: "The acquisition of Airflo further expands our presence in Africa and makes us an important player in the Kenyan flower market." Airflo is Kenya's second largest airfreight forwarder, specializing in the world-wide export of fresh cut flowers, plant cuttings and vegetables, with a focus to the Netherlands and the UK. Airflo employs a total of 167 staff in Nairobi and Aalsmeer. It organizes up to 1,500 temperature-controlled shipments per week from Kenya, totalling more than 40,000 tonnes of fresh cut flowers, especially roses, each year. Panalpina and DFG will not disclose Financial details of the deal and the acquisition is subject to approvals by both the Kenyan and Dutch authorities. Kenya, where Panalpina set up its own operations at the beginning of the year, is one of the world's key export markets for food and floral products. Fresh cut flowers accounted for more than 60% of Kenya's total air freight exports in 2014. DFG consists of 30 companies, which generated total revenues of € 1.3bn in 2014. Airflo is the group's only company involved in the transport and logistics of perishables. Marco van Zijverden, chief executive of DFG, said: "Our core business is the global trade of fresh cut flowers and plants. We have therefore decided to divest a majority share in Airflo. "However, managing the cool chain for fresh cut flowers is a crucial component of our success. By going together with a strong global player such as Panalpina, we can ensure that all customers – growers, importers and retailers – will continue to receive the quality service that they are used to. "We will further strengthen the supply chain and benefit from Panalpina's global expertise." Airflo's services in Kenya include quality control after products have been delivered to its Nairobi warehouse by growers, palletising and delivery of the secured goods ready-for-transport to the ground handling agent at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. This takes place in a temperature-controlled environment, including the use of a vacuum cooler to cool fresh cut flowers down to 4°C. Airflo coordinates its shipments with the airlines, takes care of customs clearance at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and onward distribution. "We are excited about this acquisition," adds Colin Wells, global head specialty vertical perishables at Panalpina, adding: "Kenya's flower business is literally flourishing, with expected annual export growth rates of around 5%. While it is seasonal, it is also characterized by substantial airfreight volumes on routes from South to North, counterbalancing the flow of dry cargo, which is typically flown the other way." DFG is a global family of companies with 2,200 employees and a leading player in the import, export, trade and marketing of cut flowers, bouquets, plants and decorative greens. </p>

      <p>Finnair Cargo has held the official opening ceremony for its new €80m Cool Nordic hub at Helsinki Airport. The airside facility measures 31,000 sq m, has a capacity of 350,000 tonnes per year and has 3,000 sq m dedicated areas for both pharma and perishables shipments. The centre also boasts 550 10ft ULD positions, 29 truck doors for loose shipments, five truck doors for ULDs and an automated storage and retrieval system. Speaking at the official inauguration of the terminal, Finnair Cargo's managing director, Janne Tarvainen, said that operations at the terminal got underway in November with seafood shipments. Full operations are expected to start in January, he added. Tarvainen said that the primary driver for building the new facility was expected growth in demand in line with fleet expansion. He explained that the existing facility was reaching capacity and delivery Finnair's new widebody A350 aircraft would help boost total cargo capacity by around 45% by 2020. So far, 11 of 19 A350s have been delivered, with the remainder due for delivery by 2023. Transhipment volumes, which represent around 80% of the cargo handled by the carrier at Helsinki, also continue to grow. Tarvainen pointed out that flying through Helsinki was geographically the shortest route to Asia and that the airport did not suffer with congestion, unlike some of its larger European rivals. As well as wanting to meet challenge of growing cargo volumes, the airline identified that it wanted its facility to be state-of-the-art, providing transparency and efficiency. It also needed to be able to process cargo quickly because of the large volume of transhipment traffic. Other challenges faced by the airline were outdated IT systems, reliance on paperwork, lack of visibility, rising labour costs, environmental concerns and poor data quality. Tarvainen said the facility would also need to cater for the future: "[When developing this facility] we tried to find excellence, but what does excellence look like? And, what will it look like in ten years?" he asked. Speed would be achieved through automation but also by removing data bottlenecks. Part of the solution to improving quality and visibility of data is the introduction of its Cargo Eye monitoring tool, new cargo management and warehouse management systems and a cargo control centre. The Cargo Eye solution integrates multiple data sources, transaction data and sensors to help its newly formed Cargo Control Center to monitor and steer cargo flows. The carrier added that its Cargo Eye solution provides end-to-end visibility and will ultimately lead to more comprehensive and transparent real-time information for customers, helping them to identify exceptions that require action to be taken. Shipments utilising road feeder services (RFS) can also be monitored using the system. In the future, all RFS suppliers will be required to provide connection to the Cargo Eye solution. The facility has also been Breeam certified, meaning it has passed sustainability audits, with 10% of its power coming from 1,200 solar panels. The facility is also in the process of achieving IATA CEIV Pharma certification. Looking to the future, Tarvainen said that there was room for continuous improvement with potential investment in packing robot technology, automated guided vehicles at landside acceptance, integration of ramp operations in data exchange, enhanced temperature monitoring and improved digital tools.

      <p>Three months after the launch of operations, cargo-partner has celebrated the opening of its iLogistics Center near Vienna Airport with a colourful event.</p>
      <p>The celebration took place at the company headquarters in Fischamend on 26 September with 250 guests, with the facility opening on 1 June 2018, exactly one year after the ground-breaking of the construction.</p>
      <p>The evening was moderated by Austrian journalist and presenter Sasa Schwarzjirg and kicked-off a brief introduction by cargo-partner CEO, Stefan Krauter.</p>
      <p>cargo-partner managing director in Austria, Martin Schenzel invited the iLogistics Center project team to the stage to honour the successful construction, followed by a gala dinner accompanied by an acrobatic show as well as live music.</p>
      <p>The traditional ribbon-cutting was replaced by a log sawing, performed by Krauter and Lower Austria provincial parliament representative, Gerhard Schodinger with the chainsaws being provided by power tool manufacturer Makita.</p>
      <p>Krauter says: "In times of globalisation and digitalization, we constantly have to keep transforming and adapting to stay ahead of the curve. The Vienna Airport region has always been an important hub for us and with our iLogistics Center, we have successfully created a showcase project of ecologically and economically sustainable architecture."</p>
      <p>The iLogistics Center is completely made of wood, with 4,200m3 of timber being used.</p>
      <p>Every cubic metre of wood replacing other building materials reduces CO2 emissions by 1.1 tonnes, and 0.9 tonnes of CO2 are stored in every cubic metre of wood, with the 4,200m3 of timber saving 8,400 tonnes.</p>
      <p>The centre in Fischamend contains 24,500 pallet slots in the high-bay racking system as well as 32,000 small part bins, 2,000m2 of operating handling area and several variable areas.</p>
      <p>The warehouse provides dedicated equipment for the storage and handling of various goods, with customers receiving a complete service package for spare parts logistics, retail and e-commerce.</p>
      <p>Vienna Airport head of real estate and location management, Wolfgang Scheibenpflug says: "As a longstanding and loyal partner of Vienna Airport, cargo-partner is extremely important to us, since the company's development serves not only to create and secure many jobs, but also to strengthen the traffic hub around our Airport City."</p>

    <title>Shape of things to come: Panalpina and Shapeways in strategic partnership for 3D printing</title>

      <p>Panalpina and US-based 3D printing company Shapeways have entered into a strategic partnership to expand globally their digital manufacturing capabilities. Switzerland-based logistics giant Panalpina sees digital manufacturing and 3D printing specifically as "a perfect complement to its Logistics Manufacturing Services (LMS) offering, giving customers the possibility to customise products and bring production closer to consumer demand". Mike Wilson, Panalpina's global head of Logistics, said: "3D printing is one of the most exciting frontiers of digital transformation. "It stands for the convergence of the real with the virtual world – and it has the potential to dramatically change the traditional manufacturing and logistics industries." Shapeways community members make products ranging from puzzles, miniature trains and smartphone cases, to drone accessories and jewelry. Shapeways enables its members to make, customise and sell the products they design. The products are manufactured using high-end 3D printers in 56 different materials. With the strategic partnership, Panalpina said that it will benefit from Shapeways' advanced software solutions and "in-depth know-how of 3D printing materials, equipment and processes". In return, Panalpina with its global footprint and facilities in major markets can offer Shapeways "geographical expansion possibilities and support in logistics, manufacturing, distribution and other value-added services". Shapeways chief executive Peter Weijmarshausen said: "As manufacturing moves from analog to digital, everything we know about product creation will change. Our community the world over is leveraging access to digital manufacturing from our platform to bring thousands of new products to life every day." Panalpina said that while the technology for 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, has been around for decades, its recent surge in popularity "makes perfect sense in the context of current major manufacturing trends". 3D printing supply chains are edging ever closer to the mainstream after UPS announced in May this year that it would connect a network of printers across the US with its delivery network and an online order platform. Shorter product life cycles, the rise in digital purchasing and the higher speed to get products to market, means that production is moving away from centralised manufacturing to a more distributed model. Customers are demanding more customised and personalised products and have the ability to influence the product design. "3D printing is ideal for bringing production closer to the end user and aiding in mass personalisation," explained Wilson. Panalpina recently launched two joint research projects with Cardiff University (UK), where the company aims to identify the products that could be switched from traditional to new, additive manufacturing techniques and also the impact these techniques will have on future supply chains. In October of last year, Panalpina invested in its first 3D printer to get an understanding of how the technology works as a complement to its Logistics Manufacturing Services (LMS) offering. Having gone through this learning curve the company is now positioned to take the business further. Added Weijmarshausen: "Panalpina is ideally suited to assist with the final steps in the manufacturing process including last-mile delivery. In addition, they are investing in their own 3D printing research and capabilities. This demonstrates how committed and serious Panalpina is about the technology, making them an ideal partner for us." Wilson sees additional advantages of 3D printing besides the fact that products make it to market faster and can be personalized or customized at the latest possible stage: "Because the value for the customer is added at the end of the supply chain, the brand owner can keep inventories, as well as the cost of transportation and obsolescence, to a minimum. Moreover, additive manufacturing produces less waste than traditional manufacturing methods, which fits perfectly with increasingly circular economies." </p>

      <p>A growing trend in the air cargo industry is the forming of airport freight communities and key decision makers believe for industry to be a success in future then further development of them is essential, writes Justin Burns.</p>
      <p>On the second day of The International Air Cargo Association's (TIACA) Executive Summit in Miami on 20 October, the community approach was discussed at length in the session 'Building Airport Communities'.</p>
      <p>TIACA chairman and Delhi International Airport head of cargo, Sanjiv Edward was behind the development of a community in Delhi back in 2012 and hailed the success of the initiative.</p>
      <p>He told delegates: "We realised there is loads you can do on your own, but unless you have people working together you will not get anywhere. All parts of the supply chain are part of it. Everyone is represented and we have got the voice of everyone."</p>
      <p>"If you want to progress then airport communities are a necessity. The government listens because we come as one voice," he added.</p>
      <p>Edward said Delhi is also sharing best practices with other gateways in India on how to develop air cargo airport communities.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt Airport's (FRA) Air Cargo Community Frankfurt continues to go from strength to strength and improve efficiency at FRA.</p>
      <p>The operator is Fraport and the firm's senior vice president of cargo Felix Kreutel said communities are the "best way to fully optimise" airport freight businesses.</p>
      <p>The panel was chaired by Brussels Airport Company head of cargo, Steven Polmans, who then asked panelists what they see the role of the airport is in regards to the air cargo chain.</p>
      <p>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol head of cargo, Jonas Van Stekelenburg said he sees hubs as having a functionality role: "I think because of the all these that are different, we need somebody (airports) to oversee it all and have some kind of neutrality."</p>
      <p>Kreutel felt airports have to facilitate and enable the best possible conditions for companies to do business and it is about creating efficiency, quality and optimising the whole business.</p>
      <p>Stekelenburg also added he thinks there is an even greater role for airports to play in the supply chain, citing how Schiphol is working with Dutch Customs on various projects.</p>
      <p>Kreutel agreed: "We can add more to the supply chain. We as an airport can orchestrate the players and harmonise and sychronise the processes. We can contribute to standards." He added: "For shippers, airports are black holes and communities create new visibility."</p>
      <p>And Edward said TIACA can in future play an important role, as it can help bring airport communities together to work collaboratively as its members come from across the supply chain.</p>

      <p>The U-Freight Group is taking e+Solutions, its logistics product designed for e-commerce start-ups, to the Malaysian marketplace.</p>
      <p>The group launched the product in Hong Kong six months ago, targeting the growing number of small businesses and start-ups who often have limited resources and are looking for cost effective behind-the-scenes assistance.</p>
      <p>The new e+ Solutions service is being rolled out to U-Freight's e-commerce fulfilment centre (EFC) in Penang to offer a comprehensive e-commerce logistics package: from dedicated storage space for the entrepreneurs' products, to order processing and fulfilment services, including final delivery to customers.</p>
      <p>They will benefit from complete data transparency, with real time inventory updates, plus web and mobile app access for immediate management and status updates of order instructions, plus subsequent live reporting of delivery tracking.</p>
      <p>U-Freight Group chief executive officer Simon Wong says: "We are confident that the roll out of e+Solutions to Malaysia will be as successful as the operation in Hong Kong where it is now a proven example of how we are utilising technology and infrastructure to help deliver bespoke logistics solutions."</p>

      <p>Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad Cargo has inaugurated its Cargo Control Center, a new facility which enables the company to actively monitor all shipments in real time across both flights and road feeder services on a 24/7 basis. This represents the next step in Etihad's digitalization program.</p>
      <p>According to Etihad, the new center's technology platform is based on "always-on" tracking capabilities, including shipment planning and performance monitoring across the freighter fleet and in the bellies of more than 100 passenger aircraft. The center is equipped with large screen displays that use advanced algorithms to generate alerts when issues might impact shipments, particularly those that contain specialty products and are therefore most sensitive to disruptions. Etihad is also now able to resolve any service irregularities or issues more effectively and deliver more shipments as booked, a key parameter measured by IATA interest group Cargo iQ.</p>
      <p>"As our latest digitalization initiative, the Cargo Control Center shifts our modus operandi from a historically reactive model, to a truly proactive service delivery machine that strives to maintain the service delivery promise and support customers' needs every step of their shipment journey," said Andre Blech, head of operations and delivery at Etihad Cargo.</p>
      <p>Etihad Cargo said that the control center would allow it to oversee road feeder shipments on more than 100 lanes in Europe and the Americas over the coming months. As part of a second phase, further functionality will be added to the center so that Etihad can monitor its Quick Ramp Transfer shipments at Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH) and customer service teams can proactively take immediate corrective action.</p>
      <p>Etihad Cargo began its digitalization initiative in October 2018, when it implemented the iCargo system from IBS Software. The carrier's version combined six legacy platforms into one. In a separate, planned development, Advanced Cargo Information monitoring, which sends automated alerts on custom conflicts so that time spent checking individual shipment documentation is minimized, will be configured on 10 of Etihad Cargo's busiest routes by the end of the year.</p>

      <p>Paradigm Corporation has rebranded as Swivel Software, offering web-based logistics products for freight forwarders and shippers. Hong Kong-based Swivel Software supplies products designed to increase visibility and transparency along the supply chain, enabling freight forwarders to become more efficient in their international shipment planning and execution through e-commerce and digitalisation. According to a statement from the company, Swivel Software represents "a new approach to digitalising processes for freight forwarders seeking seamless supply chain management tools. "With the emphasis on technology that is easy to access and use, and more personalised customer service than is currently available in the market, Swivel has a unique corporate pedigree. "This approach will set it, and its portfolio of products, aside in a market bedevilled with complex, inflexible software options presented to both forwarders and shippers," the statement informed." Announcing the new company's launch in Hong Kong and the simultaneous opening of its North American headquarters, chief executive Matt Motsick said: "We are Swivel by name and fully flexible and adaptive by nature. "Years of experience in supplying software tools to international supply chain operators [have] made us very familiar with the true needs of forwarders and logistics service providers." He continued: "Providing detailed and real-time information for their customers; achieving reliable connectivity with branch and agency offices; uniting operational and financial data on one platform and all for a level of investment commensurate with [an] SME's budget. "At Swivel we plan to empower digital logistics for this sector of the market, enabling it to better service the growing needs of an e-commerce environment." Mandy Mak, the original owner or Paradigm and now chief operating offices of Swivel Software, said: "There is currently a big technology lag. Other sectors are advancing in web-based software, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. "The global supply chain needs to adopt these tools to the e-commerce age and forwarders in particular need to connect digitally. They must communicate more efficiently with their partners, agents and customers in order to service current trends in e-commerce and dynamic sourcing patterns."</p>

      <p>Express delivery firms may still be exploring the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles for their own purposes, but they can also be a lucrative source of business in themselves. DHL's Global Forwarding air and ocean freight specialist has signed a contract with Chinese consumer electronics exporter, Shenzhen Youkeshu Technologies to transport remote-controlled helicopters, parts and other hobbyist items. DHL will establish a dedicated 24/7 freight control tower in Shenzhen to manage the shipments to more than 100 countries. It will also provide air, sea, and rail freight services to hubs in Asia and Europe. The shipper said it had selected DHL because of its extensive freight network and the professionalism of its operations personnel. Vice president, Marpo Wang, said: "With more than 100,000sq m of warehouse storage for around 100,000 stock-keeping units from 4,000 different suppliers, we needed a solutions provider who could not only provide a wide range of forwarding modes and routes, but also manage our complex space and delivery requirements in an effective and timely manner. We have already worked with DHL for two years on a range of forwarding requirements and have great trust in their ability to coordinate immense amounts of freight traffic in an efficient and agile manner." He added: "E-commerce has brought significantly more complexity to how we manage factors like shipment volume, transit time, and cargo-ready dates, demanding a great deal of agility to accurately meet constant swings in demand. DHL's expertise and dedicated personnel will play a major role in developing and adapting our strategy for B2B and B2C e-commerce fulfillment in overseas markets, particularly as we continue to expand our product range with new designs for drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles."</p>

    <content>
      <p>Liege Airport Cargo Handling Services (LACHS) has reduced its truck handling times through the implementation of a slot booking system from Nallian.</p>
      <p>LACHS, which handles almost 200,000 tonnes of cargo per year and 150 trucks per day, said that using the system had helped it reduced the average time it takes to handle a truck, including paperwork and warehouse operations, to two hours from three hours previously.</p>
      <p>This has helped the company improve productivity by 33% in the six months since the booking system was put into use, Nallian said.</p>
      <p>The app allows LACHS to make capacity available using a wide range of parameters, such as cargo type, type of location, day type etc.</p>
      <p>The booker requests a slot and the system automatically matches availability and demand or proposes alternatives when needed.</p>
      <p>Drivers who arrive with a booked slot enjoy priority treatment, both when accessing the cargo zone and at the registration desk.</p>
      <p>One of the key drivers for using Slot Booking at Liege Airport was ensuring the highest level of customer service while dealing with this rapid growth.</p>
      <p>"Our main ambition was to improve the quality of our service, not to work faster. Using the Slot Booking application, we managed to do both," said Hossaine El Bouayadi, IT manager and business process development at LACHS.</p>
      <p>"The Slot Booking app helps us to better channel pick-ups and deliveries.</p>
      <p>"We can make sure we have the right staff and equipment available when the drivers arrive, and prepare the goods pro-actively.</p>
      <p>"It also enables us to better coordinate acceptance and warehouse operations, which makes life easier for both our staff and the drivers, and speeds up operations."</p>
      <p>Aurélie Dethier, deputy customer service and operations manager at Liege Airport, added: "We have implemented the LGG Cargo Cloud with the aim to empower all actors at our  to drive efficiency and transparency in their cross-company processes. We are excited about these results and look forward to extending the benefits of the Slot Booking to the other ground handlers active at our airport shortly." </p>
      <p>Nallian chief executive Jean Verheyen said: "Liege Airport was, worldwide, the fastest growing cargo airport in 2018 and we are thrilled to see our collaborative applications are helping them to drive this growth in their cargo operations.</p>
      <p>"Enabling airports to drive efficiency and transparency by 'working as one' is one of the reasons why we designed Nallian for Air Cargo. It is also why we keep continuously keep on extending our open app ecosystem, together with forward-looking players such as Liege Airport and their cargo community."</p>

      <p>"We are able to approach every customer in a unique way, based on their particular needs, by sending them specific offers and information appropriate to their level of specialisation. Big data and a sophisticated CRM strategy make it possible for us to adopt this approach," said GertJan Roelands, vice president Europe of Air France KLM Martinair Cargo.</p>
      <p>"WHAT COUNTS offer our customers' myCargo-a unique digital portal where our customers can manage their bookings 24/7. It comprises a range of services, such as Quote &amp; Book, Notify Me, Track &amp; Trace, and claims, to name a few," he informed.</p>
      <p>"We are developing myCargo in an agile way. Based on customer needs, we are introducing enhancements to our existing services every three months. In addition to the e-services, we also have created dedicated customer service and sales desks in our market organisation to help us further specialise in the specific needs of our SME customers and interact with them more effectively," said Roelands.</p>
      <p>"We highly value our customers' loyalty, which is why we are now awarding blue credits for cargo bookings, in the same way we do passengers for flights, through our BlueBiz programme. So, our customers can now receive blue credits for both their cargo and passenger flights when they book Air France and KLM. These blue credits can be spent on airline tickets, thereby presenting our customers with a way to further reduce their travel costs," he said.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the WHAT COUNTS programme was developed in the Netherlands. "We have seen our market share and customer satisfaction growing in this specific customer segment in the Netherlands. At the moment, we are gradually introducing this new scheme in Germany, the UK, and Italy. The rest of Europe will follow in the first half of 2018," says Roelands.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the implementation of WHAT COUNTS is seen as a substantial enhancement of Air France KLM Martinair Cargo's service by utilizing its big data, digital and CRM, while maintaining personal touch points.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Pharma Gateway Amsterdam (PGA) is looking to add members to further improve cooperation, collaboration and transparency in the pharma supply chain at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.</p>
      <p>AirBridgeCargo Airlines was the latest to join last month and the second airline to sign up to the 14-member quality pharma initiative, which was set-up in March 2016.</p>
      <p>Head of cargo, Jonas van Stekelenburg (pictured left), expects a few more "big players" to join in the coming months and widening the membership is a key priority. "We aim to substantially increase the number of participants: the more Schiphol players focused on quality and transparency, the better it gets.</p>
      <p>"Furthermore, we aim for everyone to obtain their IATA CEIV Pharma certification (or comparable quality standard) as quickly as possible. With this, everyone talks the same language and we can cooperate in more areas of the pharma logistics chain," van Stekelenburg says.</p>
      <p>PGA has recently started an early warning project for pharma shippers, which will help move cargo more quickly and safely through Amsterdam and it received a €1 million research grant, which will fund data collection and monitoring PGA shipments to identify changes, such as temperature incursions.</p>
      <p>"This data will then be used to design a model to alert shippers to issues with their consignment. With this project, we aim to add something valuable that wasn't there before," van Stekelenburg explains.</p>
      <p>In the first five months of 2017, Schiphol has seen pharma cargo grow by 8.5 per cent, although this is more or less the same growth as general cargo.</p>
      <p>This is more than it expected according to van Stekelenburg, but growth numbers were not the primary focus and this year the emphasis has been on enhancement of quality and service.</p>
      <p>And it has been busy attracting more members, getting more (CEIV or other) quality training for community members, supporting projects to improve quality and transparency of the pharma logistics chain, and supporting community players in attracting more business.</p>
      <p>All carriers at Schiphol are driving pharma traffic van Stekelenburg says, but the key trade lanes are to and from the US, while Europe he notes is exporting a lot to Asia.</p>
      <p>He says: "All this traffic is going for the most part via Schiphol. This is not different to other airfreight: within Europe we truck cargo and outside Europe cargo is flown. Schiphol is known for its quality and efficient handling, and has the most direct destinations in the world. This is unprecedented and exactly what pharma wants: flown as direct as possible."</p>
      <p>PGA has had an impact on pharma traffic in van Stekelenburg's view: "PGA participants all boosted the quality and the transparency of their operations. The community approach all kick started this – we collectively procured the training.</p>
      <p>"Furthermore, we worked together in getting an even better cooperation with Customs and in getting the message out. This all resulted – as we heard back from PGA participants – in higher customer satisfaction and more business."</p>

      <p>Solace and CORE Transport Technologies have expanded their partnership to support real-time tracking for unit load devices (ULD) in the air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>Building on their 12-year partnership, the two companies offering will help air carriers effectively implement and manage Internet of Things (IoT) devices for improved monitoring, tracking and routing of shipments.</p>
      <p>Software developer CORE managing director, Ian Craig says: "There is no denying the power of IoT in optimising air carriers' shipping processes and operations, and Solace provides the secure and scalable messaging backbone needed for what could become one of the largest IoT implementations in the world."</p>
      <p>CORE's software is powered by Solace's Virtual Message Router in Microsoft Azure and part of the Solace Cloud product that allows logistics companies to effectively synchronise and exchange critical information in real-time, updating users on the status of their deliveries as well as potential problems.</p>
      <p>The technology is in active roll-out with one the largest North American airlines driving smarter analytics, deeper visualisations and more effective command and control functions to improve transparency of air cargo shipments.</p>
      <p>Data movement technology provider Solace CTO, Shawn McAllister says: "While IoT is helping air carriers spot these problems, they still need to invest in the right supporting technologies for efficient and secure communications between all the moving parts. Our deepening partnership with CORE helps air carriers make faster, smarter decisions to ultimately deliver better customer experiences."</p>

    <content>
      <p>Panalpina has made another acquisition in the shape of German perishables firm Cool Chain  Group (CCG) – only 24 hours after it announced it was taking over Dutch perishables handler Interfresh Airfreight Handling.</p>
      <p>The move is part of the freight forwarder's strategy to strengthen its Perishables Network as it puts a focus on the vertical after completing a deal for Kenyan forwarder of fruit and vegetables Air Connection earlier this year, while it acquired Kenyan perishables forwarder Airflo in 2016.</p>
      <p>Panalpina has entered into an agreement with CCG, whose parent company is Rungs Express, which will see it taking over the business and a team specialising in international airfreight and the import of perishables. The companies have agreed not to disclose any financial details of the deal.</p>
      <p>CCG has a flourishing perishables business stemming from well over 100 customers and representing around 14,000 tonnes of airfreight per year.</p>
      <p>Panalpina has set it sights on becoming the perishables market leader through its Panalpina Perishables Network. The company's perishables activities originated in Latin America and were then extended to Europe and Africa. The network will span 15 key countries at first, with a clear plan to double the network to cover all regions.</p>
      <p>Panalpina chief executive officer, Stefan Karlen says: "Our recent acquisitions in the perishables market have concentrated on the export side, but we also want to increase our footprint in key import markets and build our end-to-end perishables capabilities at major gateways such as Frankfurt and, as demonstrated yesterday, Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>"These latest developments are further important steps towards offering complete end-to-end solutions on a global scale as we continue to expand our Perishables Network,"</p>
      <p>Rungis Express says it was a strategic move to focus on their core business of overland distribution and the wholesale of gourmet products, and has decided to shift away from international freight forwarding activities.</p>
      <p>Managing director, Kai Schneider says: "Over the years, we have built a very knowledgeable team that specializes in international air freight and the import of perishables such as fresh cut flowers, beans, fish, frozen sea food and mangoes, mostly from Africa and Latin America.</p>
      <p>"However, we want to refocus on our key capabilities and are convinced that these specialists and the customers they serve will be in better hands with Panalpina,"</p>
      <p>The former managing director of CCG, Markus Kampa, will lead the entire team and further develop the business as Panalpina's new country head of Perishables Germany.</p>
      <p>Panalpina will additionally have access to cold storage space within CCG's temperature-controlled transit warehouse in Kelsterbach, close to Frankfurt Airport and one of Europe's most important import hubs for perishables.</p>
      <p>Panalpina will continue to benefit from CCG's well-established overland distribution network and cool chain capabilities in Germany and many neighboring countries.</p>
      <p>Panalpina's managing director for Germany, Dominik Wiesler says: "We are very happy to welcome the new perishables experts in Germany. We are bringing an experienced team on board that will greatly help to develop perishables end-to-end services for Germany and the neighboring countries of Switzerland, Austria, Poland and Czechia."</p>

      <p>The momentum for IATA's global standard for pharmaceutical handling continued to grow this week as Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) announced that it has met all IATA CEIV-Pharma certifications, making it the first handler in Hong Kong to obtain the certification. The process was sponsored by the Hong Kong Airport Authority, as part of an effort to bring all relevant airport groups up to IATA CEIV-Pharma standards.</p>
      <p>The Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV-Pharma) is an IATA-supported guarantee of standards for the storage and transportation of pharmaceuticals by air. The aviation organization's cold-chain management standards and assurance of product integrity are part of an effort to increase the volume and standards of pharma shipments that travel by air. Pharma shipments generally command larger margins than other commodities.</p>
      <p>Pharma shippers, on the other hand, are more concerned with the integrity and timeliness of their multi-million dollar shipments than they are with cutting costs, presenting a lucrative opportunity for carriers and handlers that can guarantee shipments and adhere to the standards throughout the entire supply chain.</p>
      <p>The validation covers the company's quality management system and procedures, personnel, training, documentation, infrastructure and equipment, quarantine procedures, sub-contractor management, self-inspection procedures, transportation and operations.</p>
      <p>Hactl finished 2016 in strong form, beating 2015 tonnage by 1.7 percent to more than 1.65 million tonnes, and setting new terminal and ramp-handling records, with pharma making up a high-margin component of the handler's trade.</p>
      <p>Hactl was also the first handling facility at the airport to achieve Good Distribution Practices (GDP) accreditation back in late 2014, bringing it in line with the World Health Organization's quality assurance guidelines for pharmaceutical handling.</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo, one year after implementing its new iCargo digitalisation platform, has now joined cargo.one's online booking system.</p>
      <p>Etihad joins seven other airlines, including Lufthansa Cargo, Nippon Cargo Airlines and Finnair, on the multi-carrier platform.</p>
      <p>"Etihad Cargo's ambition to lead the industry into a new digital era has driven significant investment in our digitalisation programme across back-of-house and customer–facing platforms in the last 12 months," said Abdulla Mohamed Shadid, Etihad Aviation Group's managing director of cargo and logistics services.</p>
      <p>"This landmark partnership with cargo.one builds on the success we have achieved on our own online platform, etihadcargo.com, which now represents 38% of our bookings.</p>
      <p>"Our digital investment enabled us to rapidly build the required API connectivity to seamlessly link to the cargo.one platform.</p>
      <p>"Through cargo.one, we will offer global capacity to users on new routings and to new destinations across our extensive worldwide network, and provide our own customers with additional booking choice."</p>
      <p>Etihad's iCargo online booking portal saw monthly booking rate growth hit 33.7% in September, with the region with the highest online booking penetration rate  being Asia, with India making 96% of its bookings that month through the site and Thailand close to the 90% mark. The Americas represents the second-highest rate, with the US passing the 50% mark for online bookings.</p>
      <p>Cargo.one, meanwhile, claims to serve 300 forwarders in Europe.</p>
      <p>"cargo.one is the number-one choice for airlines to foster digitalisation and to put their customers first," said Moritz Claussen, managing director. "Our fast-growing user base not only makes it attractive for airlines to join as a means of reaching new customers, but also helps them to serve their customers' needs in the best possible way."</p>

      <p>Siemens Postal, Parcel &amp; Airport Logistics (SPPAL) officially opened its new manufacturing facility in Constance, Germany, on February 20. Siemens manufactures products and systems for the postal, parcel and airport logistics market at the new plant. "We are proud of this modern production site, where we manufacture innovative products and solutions for our customers all around the world," enthused Michael Reichle, SPPAL chief executive, at the inaugural ceremony. "Bringing the development and manufacture of our products together under one roof is a decisive success factor," he continued. "It enables us to efficiently develop innovative and forward-looking system concepts for logistical sorting processes ready for commercial maturity. "Thanks to the quality products we produce here as well as our automation expertise and long years of experience in software we are able to help our customers benefit from trends such as the booming e-commerce business, growing mobility worldwide and Industry 4.0". Industry 4 is the trend toward greater automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, the move towards the 'smart factory'. SPPAL has made many extensive improvements to its Constance site – from what it describes as an "intelligent factory layout to well thought-out production and assembly processes, resulting, among other things, in shorter throughput times". Plus, Siemens has been able to further expand the manufacture of heavy systems for the parcel and airport sectors. The main manufacturing area has a floor space of almost 14,000 sq m, while ergonomic workstations offer employees features including height-adjustable work benches and modern equipment such as cranes and hoisting gear. "We consistently work hard to focus on serving our customers even better in the future. Our employees, too, profit from the investments we make in the future," Reichle said. Following the establishment of an Innovation and Test Center for parcel logistics in Nuremberg and the move to the new headquarters in Constance, the opening of this new manufacturing site constitutes what Siemens said represents an "important milestone for SPPAL in its reorganisation of the company". Work on the new building was initially begun in November 2015. SPPAL has around 3,000 employees based around the world, 600 of them in Constance. Following the move to the new company headquarters and the opening of the new manufacturing plant, the previous site has been completely given up by Siemens and those premises are currently undergoing development for other purposes.</p>

      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo has signed an agreement with DoKaSch Temperature Solutions to offer its Opticooler range of temperature-controlled containers. This will provide Qatar Airways Cargo customers with the choice of a range of active containers to transport their pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>Qatar Airways' chief officer, Cargo, Ulrich Ogiermann, said, "We understand the intricacies of a seamless cool chain and always aim to provide value to our customers. Through this agreement with DoKaSch, we have now expanded our active container offering for customers, presenting our business partners with more options to transport their pharmaceuticals globally."</p>
      <p>Andreas Seitz, managing director of DoKaSch Temperature Solutions, said, "We are very pleased to make our Opticooler containers available through one of the world's largest international cargo carriers. We are convinced that with Qatar Airways Cargo's extensive and rapidly-growing network, and our joint commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, this partnership will provide a great solution for the global Pharma cool chain."</p>
      <p>The Active Cool Containers RAP and RKN Opticooler are equipped with electric, battery-powered cooling compressors and heaters and require no dry ice. This high-end packaging solution safeguards the efficacy of vital pharmaceuticals throughout the transportation chain. Valued for their exceptional reliability and performance in any climate, these active containers keep the cargo within a temperature range of 2 to 8 degrees celsius or 15 to 25 degrees celsius. The system features a straight forward touch screen interface, making the temperature setting extremely dependable.</p>
      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo recently announced the launch of its brand new Climate Control Centre, a 2,470 square metre airside transit facility for temperature-sensitive cargo. The facility features two temperature-controlled zones operating at both 2 to 8 and 15 to 25 degrees celsius with a capacity to hold a total of 156 ULDs (unit load devices) at a time. Segregated sections within the facility enable storage of pharmaceutical products in compliance with 'Good Distribution Practice' (GDP) guidelines. To ensure complete temperature integrity, the facility is equipped with six truck docks, each with inflated curtains and an anteroom as a staging area.</p>
      <p>QR Pharma is Qatar Airways Cargo's specialist product developed for pharmaceuticals and healthcare cargo. It offers both active solutions to maintain a consistent temperature throughout the transportation chain, as well as passive solutions that handle products within a desired temperature band during all stages of the journey. As an industry leader, the cargo carrier ensures the fastest transfer at Doha through its unique Quick Ramp Transfer (QRT). It is the only cargo carrier in the Middle East to offer refrigerated or 'reefer' truck services for ramp transfers at its home hub.</p>
      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo has invested considerably in quality handling, infrastructure, facilities, people and procedures at each of its Pharma stations, underpinning the need for high operating standards for transporting pharmaceuticals and healthcare products. Expertly-trained staff at every Pharma destination ensures the cool chain is unbroken. Plans are underway to add IoT devices on board the aircraft that will provide real-time temperature updates, enhancing and completing the end-to-end track and trace service.</p>
      <p>The significant investments in the cool chain and expansion of its Pharma network are part of the cargo carrier's strategy and commitment to improve and enhance its product offering for the benefit of the pharmaceutical industry globally. The cargo carrier's QR Pharma volumes have grown by 42 percent in 2016-17 over 2015-16.</p>
      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo's expanding Pharma network spans 73 stations, with the recent addition of Colombo and Dublin. It pioneered industry-leading Pharma Express flights from the key pharmaceutical hubs of Basel, Brussels, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, supporting the huge pharmaceutical exports from these destinations.</p>

      <p>Vienna Airport has expanded its cargo centre and opened a new temperature-controlled pharma hub. The €17.9m investment includes a new pharma handling centre featuring about 1,600sq m of space as part of the recently enlarged air cargo facility. The €1.9 m pharma site includes a cold store with an area of 153sq m offers a temperature range of 2°-8°C, while a further 1,415sq m of the cold storage facility can be controlled in a range of 15°-25°C. DHL is also planning to set up a 60,000sq m logistics centre at the site, creating 500 new jobs. Board member Julian Jäger said the new site would allow the airport to tap into Austria's booming pharma export industry. He explained:  "Our market position as an air cargo transshipment hub will be further strengthened thanks to the expansion of the air cargo centre. We will support domestic pharmaceutical companies by providing special, highly professional handling services." He added that products to the value of €8bn a year – half the export production value of Lower Austria – are moved to export markets via Vienna Airport Recent road improvements in the area include the Schwadorf-Fischamend bypass along the western edge of the airport and the Lobau Tunnel which completes the motorway ring around Vienna, added fellow board member Günther Ofner. The airport recently put its third solar electricity site into operation on the roof of the air cargo centre. With an area of about 8,000sq m, it is one of the largest plants of its kind in Austria, with an annual output of about 750,000 kWh. It provides power for both the air cargo centre and the wider airport. </p>

      <p>Kale Logistics Solutions is offering a comprehensive suite of IT solutions for the logistics domain. Recently, the company launched a specialised e-Booking platform under the brand RIGEL at WINGS INDIA 2018 at Hyderabad, India (pictured).</p>
      <p>This One Stop e-Booking Platform is India's first comprehensive online platform to assist cargo rate discovery and booking procedures for the air cargo industry. Absence of a single online source that can provide information pertaining to availability of cargo routes and the corresponding reservation rates to exporters, freight forwarders and Custom brokers has made the process tedious and prone to malpractices.</p>
      <p>With Kale's online e-Booking platform, routes, rates and schedules for cargo booking are readily accessible through the system, thereby benefitting the concerned stakeholders. It also ensures that compliances for further processing of the shipment are met at the point of booking.</p>
      <p>This booking data is reusable for further shipment processing by way of connecting to other stakeholders such as airports and airlines. The platform is equipped with comprehensive modules for such as quote management, multi-channel booking with EDI communication with airlines, GST invoicing, e-payment gateway, tracking and reporting for all stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the launch, Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation secretary, Rajiv Nayan Choubey says: "Platforms such as RIGEL have become a necessity in today's trade eco-system. It is a new era IT-solution to a complex age-old problem whose time has come. Trade facilitation initiatives like RIGEL provide the much necessary digital support to drive ease of business. Its potential reach is multimodal.</p>
      <p>"Moreover, it also brings stakeholders, including the shippers from the hinterlands of India, under a single platform thus allowing an opportunity to discuss and find constructive solutions for the furtherance of the industry along with necessary compliance being met. RIGEL reaffirms the role of technology in streamlining and improving the air cargo trade scenario."</p>

      <p>Asiana Airlines Cargo, the freight operation of the South Korea-based carrier, has inked a 10-year, multi-million-dollar contract with logistics IT solutions specialist IBS Software for the its iCargo management system. According to the terms of the deal, IBS will integrate the complete range of Asiana Cargo's business operations – incorporating sales, revenue accounting, ULD management, mail management and mail revenue accounting – within the single iCargo platform. According to IBS, the implementation of iCargo will allow the freight carrier to upgrade its IT capabilities from its home-grown legacy core system and a multitude of satellite systems to a single, fully integrated, new-generation platform. As such, an IBS statement continued, it should allow the carrier to make value-adding enhancements in areas such as revenue and yield management, product management, real-time shipment monitoring and control, as well as in advanced technology capabilities such as enterprise mobility. The iCargo platform will also enable Asiana Cargo to conform to industry-driven standards and best practices, such as electronic air waybills (eAWBs) and CXML, the technology specialist noted. Kwang-Suk Kim, executive vice president of Asiana Cargo, remarked: "By selecting iCargo as our technology platform, we are hopeful that we (will) be able to cater to the demands of fast changing logistics services environment and improve our market share. "We are sure that it will also bring a groundbreaking improvement opportunity in reinforcing cargo operation safety and customer services." Rajiv Shah, chief executive of IBS Software, added: "This selection by Asiana Airlines highlights IBS's ability to conceptualise and build industry-leading global solutions which bring tangible business benefits. "IBS continues to invest in innovative offerings for the airline industry to ensure that our customers stay ahead in this disruptive environment. "This partnership with Asiana is also a testament to our commitment to the Korean market as we continue to expand our presence in East Asia." While IBS notes that its modular iCargo solution supports all the IT needs of air cargo management in a single, fully integrated platform, it can also be tailored to suit the specific needs and priorities of different customers. Capable of addressing the needs of all kinds of cargo operations – large or small, combination or pure freighter, low-cost carrier (LCC) or full-service airline – iCargo now supports the cargo movements of over 25 airlines across the world. Asiana Airlines currently operates to 14 domestic and 90 international passenger destinations, but it also flies 27 dedicated cargo routes throughout Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania.</p>

      <p>SEGRO and Aviva Investors, through their joint venture, Airport Property Partnership (APP), have launched 'Skyline', a new logistics development adjacent to Heathrow Airport.</p>
      <p>The development will initially consist of two warehouse units of 73,530 square feett and 80,440 square feet. Both have the potential for office space across the first and second floors. The units will be complete in Summer 2016.</p>
      <p>Located close to Heathrow Airport and its cargo terminal, Skyline offers international connectivity and easy access to the national motorway network from the M4 and M25.</p>
      <p>APP and SEGRO's business unit director for Greater London, Alan Holland, says: "Skyline is a development in the right place at the right time. The connectivity to Heathrow, to London and to the UK's motorway network make the location the ideal place for business and will create employment opportunities for the local area.</p>
      <p>"Based on feedback from our customers and our expertise in the Heathrow market, we are confident that the new units are what companies are looking for but cannot find in today's market.</p>
      <p>"The Skyline development will ensure that we can offer our customers a wide range of different sized warehouses in locations which meet their needs."</p>
      <p>The new development will offer large, secure yard areas, with 12 metre eaves height, and APP is aiming to gain top environmental ratings for the build.</p>
      <p>Other occupiers near the logistics warehouses include DB Schenker, Rolls-Royce and Panalpina.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Rio de Janiero is now a Delta Cargo Variation Pharma 4 station, making it the first in Latin America. Effective June 13, the Rio de Janeiro Galeão International Airport (GIG) became one of only 49 airports around the world certified to handle Variation Pharma products, and one of a select 16 that can handle pharmaceuticals with a "4" designation.</p>
      <p>Variation Pharma is a SkyTeam Cargo product that was developed for shipments requiring temperature control and monitoring. Commodities often include, but are not limited to, vaccines, medicines and pharmaceuticals. The Variation Pharma 4 designation is assigned to commodities that need to be shipped at or around room temperature. Shipments with this designation often are prescription drugs, biotechnology products and similarly sensitive shipments that must be maintained between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius. Delta Cargo's Minneapolis customer service center is able to monitor shipments in transit.</p>
      <p>Delta Cargo's expansion of the Variation Pharma product is, in part, a reflection of the remarkable growth of biopharma as part of the larger pharmaceutical industry. A common feature of these advanced treatments is their high price-tag, which makes air cargo an economically viable form of transportation even more so than for conventional medicines. Moreover, biosimilar drugs are expensive enough that they require fast and sensitive supply chains – land and marine shipping are rarely viable options.</p>
      <p>According to McKinsey, biopharmaceuticals generate global revenues of US$163 billion, or about 20 percent of the total pharma market. This class of drugs is the fastest-growing in the industry. The annual growth rate of more than 8 percent is twice that of conventional pharma, and this rate is expected to hold for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>The number of biotech patent applications has been growing at 25 percent annually since 1995. There were more than 1,500 biomolecules undergoing clinical trials as of early 2015. In other words, this is a market that is likely to experience exponential growth moving forward.</p>

      <p>Time:matters is automating the tracking process for its shipments, which it says will deliver a number of operational advantages.</p>
      <p>The speed logistics service which is a part of the Lufthansa Cargo group says selected courier partners are linked with time:matters' booking system via a direct system interface, meaning all relevant information can be exchanged automatically.</p>
      <p>This will do away with the need for additional communication between time:matters and its sub-contractors, such as Stadtbote, a courier service.</p>
      <p>"Orders are now send to our system directly via an interface. This enables us to work much more quickly and efficiently," says Stadtbote chief executive officer, Peter Karstens.</p>
      <p>Couriers receive all the key information on a shipment directly from time:matters. They can also enter details of the delivery process directly into time:matters' system.</p>
      <p>This information is compiled by the courier in a web app (an app that can be accessed using a web browser) and can then be immediately sent to the customer.</p>
      <p>This mobile front end is already being used by 100 courier partners for tracking entries. Further linking the system to a flight database enables a quick response to flight delays and cancellations.</p>
      <p>Automated tracking simplifies and speeds up the shipment process. Automatically obtaining tracking information has already increased to 80 per cent, corresponding to some 350,000 tracking points per year.</p>
      <p>The system also makes it easy to visualise complicated orders. In addition, process automation reduces the error rate for all involved. Errors in forwarding the order details are now a thing of the past when submitting the order to the courier.</p>
      <p>The accounting processes for the companies involved are also simplified since the orders are sent through the system without paper records and are automatically saved as "completed". All this means that time:matters is operating with significantly greater efficiency, allowing it to process customer requests more effectively.</p>
      <p>Time:matters chief operating officer, Christian Mörtl says: "Above all, as a further step in digitizing the logistics chain, process automation represents a major gain for our customers: They receive information that is more reliable more quickly than before and are always kept up-to-date on the current status of their shipment."</p>
      <p>time:matters says it is focusing its energies on digitising processes and tailor-made solutions to achieve greater speed and high quality standards.</p>

      <p>Cargo handler Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) and Swiss International Air Lines's air freight division Swiss WorldCargo opened New York's first GDP (Good Distribution Practice) compliant pharma facility after achieving certification of its Building 66 at JFK airport.</p>
      <p>The GDP certification confirms WFS' compliance with World Health Organization (WHO), IATA, and Parenteral Drug Association (PDA) quality standards for handling pharmaceutical and life science products, as well as with Service Level Agreements signed with individual airline customers in New York.</p>
      <p>Michael Simpson, WFS' executive vice president Americas said: "We will continue to expand our network of certified facilities, adding to our current list of JFK and Miami in the Americas as well as multiple locations in Europe."</p>
      <p>"We are very excited that New York's first GDP-compliant airline facility is located at Swiss WorldCargo's warehouse," said Michael Ganz, head of Northeast-/Midwest USA and Canada for Swiss WorldCargo.</p>
      <p>"This latest addition of GDP-compliant facilities allows us to offer additional quality corridors to our pharma and healthcare customers. The certification of our boutique-like single-airline facility in New York further strengthens our position as a global quality leader."</p>
      <p>The features of the program include a Pharmaceutical Handling Quality Manual and Quality Management System, dedicated cooler facilities, a Special Products Manager, as well as providing a team of fully experienced and trained personnel.</p>
      <p>WFS also invested in a new cooler for the 1,000 sq ft pharma facility at JFK in support of the GDP requirements.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Swiss WorldCargo received a global CEIV certification. With three daily flights from Zurich and Geneva, JFK is an important North America-gateway for Swiss WorldCargo.</p>
      <p>WFS has also signed a 15-year lease on a new state- of-the-art, 346,000 square feet cargo terminal at the airport, the first phase of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's comprehensive Vision Plan. The facility, which will have a throughput capacity of over 300 million kilos a year, will offer improved cargo flows and reduced transfer times, shorter truck waiting times and incorporate the latest security and screening systems and procedures. It will also house dedicated facilities for temperature-controlled pharmaceutical products and perishables cargo when it opens in 2020/21.</p>

      <p>Paris-based cargo handler Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) announced its plans to build a new pharmaceutical facility at Copenhagen Airport (CPH). Construction of the facility will begin in April.</p>
      <p>The new building will cover an area of 1,500 square meters equipped with temperature-controlled facilities for 2°C to 8°C pharmaceutical products. The building will be accessible through four dedicated cargo doors and will accept both loose shipments and pre-built units, with storage space for 300 EUR pallets (measuring about 47 in. x 31.5 in) and 30 PMC pallets (which measure 125 in. x 88 or 96 in.). WFS anticipates construction of the new facilities will be completed by July, whereupon the building may undergo IATA CEIV Pharma pre-assessment.</p>
      <p>WFS is also upgrading its existing temperature control areas in its current facility at CPH, which will handle pharma products requiring a temperature range of 15°C to 25°C.</p>
      <p>According to WFS, since it opened the first stage of its pharma infrastructure at CPH late in 2017 – a temperature-controlled ULD storage area with the capacity to handle 16 units – the company has seen its volume of pharma shipments grow by 90 percent at CPH.</p>
      <p>Last month, WFS attained its CEIV certification from IATA for pharmaceuticals handling at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS). The construction of this new facility at CPH shows a continuation of the company's growth, demonstrated by the growing number of carriers selecting the company for ground handling operations.</p>
      <p>The move bolsters CPH's efforts in strengthening its CPH Cargo Community. The airport broke ground on a new cargo center at the beginning of last year, and has since attracted increasing investment from integrators and service from carriers.</p>

      <p>Germany-based cargo equipment specialist Goldhofer Airport Technology has opened a sales and service center in Dubai in collaboration with cargo handling supplier ALS Logistic Solutions. The decision is based on a long-term relationship between the two companies and in response to increased demand for internal airport logistics in the Middle East and Africa region. In cooperation with ALS, Goldhofer is set to "strengthen significantly" both its presence in the Middle East and Africa region, and its marketing activities for its portfolio of ground support equipment (GSE) vehicles and services.  The new sales and service center will be located in Jumeirah Lake Towers in Dubai. The new facility will be managed by Roger Saadé, a long-standing area sales manager for the region, who said: "Our new representative office will enable us to provide customers with more intensive local support and also to recruit new business partners for Goldhofer."  The sales team will be strengthened by the appointment of Jouliana Abou Manneh as support engineer.  Management of customer service and the creation and organization of a dedicated Goldhofer parts store has been entrusted to Philipp Berger, a long-term Goldhofer employee and expert in GSE. ALS Logistic Solutions managing director Walid Khoury said that a recently established logistics warehouse in Dubai "allows attending Gulf Cooperation Council clients at the maximum speed."</p>

      <p>DHL Supply Chain has opened an Advanced Regional Center (ARC) in Singapore featuring automation systems with advanced robotics. The 90,000sq m facility, which increases the logistics firm's warehousing footprint on the island by 40%, uses 130 robotic shuttles to pick and store products from 72,000 locations spread across 26 levels. DHL believes this will improve picking efficiency picking by 20% and utilise 40% less space than conventional warehousing operations. The company said that the facility would act as a model for the future of warehousing in land-scarce countries and dense cities where land availability is limited and expensive. Deutsche Post DHL Group chief executive Frank Appel said: "We see the Asian region as a swift adopter of technologies for enhanced productivity and efficiency. "By 2020, Asia will constitute 30% of our total revenue. Facilities like the Advanced Regional Center offer a ready model of innovations that reduce complexity, improve accuracy and maximize opportunities for productivity gains." The facility also boasts clean rooms for life sciences and healthcare businesses, specialised infrastructure for aerospace operations and customised storage solutions for managing service parts for technology customers. DHL is not the only logistics company to be expanding its presence in Singapore. Earlier this year, Kuehne + Nagel also opened a new facility on the island.</p>

      <p>DHL's Global Forwarding, arm is to certify a further seven of its 11 Americas stations to IATA's CEIV Pharma Standard. It has already achieved CEIV status at Bogota, Colombia and the seven remaining stations – Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia and San Juan – are expected to follow by the end of the second quarter of 2017. The CEIV Pharma Certification confirms service and quality standards for life sciences and healthcare customers. US chief executive for DHL Global Forwarding, David Goldberg, said: "Through a targeted approach, we have selected stations in some of our key US hubs to undergo the rigorous audit certification process in order to further solidify our leadership position in these markets." DHL started to certify its global stations according to the IATA CEIV Pharma Standard in the third quarter of 2016. It adds that its LifeTrack cloud-based IT platform offers more transparency compared with other offers for temperature-controlled transport, ensuring not only shipment tracking but also allowing round-the-clock  intervention. At its Air Thermonet locations, DHL offers a wide-ranging product portfolio for time and temperature sensitive air freight shipments, along with the Medical Express fixed delivery time service and the DHL Clinical Trial Logistics logistics solution. </p>

      <p>Frankfurt is streamlining and digitising the registration process for truck drivers at the airport to speed up operations. Germany's largest air cargo gateway said that trucks generally have to wait to be loaded or unloaded but a study of the freight area by Kai-Oliver Schocke, Professor at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences found that digitisation of check-in could save ten minutes per truck. With more than 1,000 trucks arriving daily, the total time saving could be very significant, it added. A group of 70 students from the department of logistics and production management examined how to match legal requirements with the information required required by the six different handling agents at the airport. Unified paper forms will be introduced shortly, followed by implementation of a digital form through a cargo community system. Air Cargo Community Frankfurt executive Patrik Tschirch, said: "This will help to improve cooperation between all companies along the supply chain within CargoCity." The Frankfurt air cargo community is also developing a combined IT solution to improve transparency and processes in pharmaceutical logistics. It follows a study by the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences which identified potential areas for optimisation, which are now being implemented by community members including airlines, handlers, forwarders and IT providers. Fraport ground handling services (BVD) and the handlers Swissport, Celebi, LUG and FCS are currently being audited according to CEIV pharma on behalf of IATA. Vice chairwoman of Air Cargo Community Frankfurt, Anke Giesen: explained: "With this new concept, we are able to decrease the complexity of ordering processes and increase reliability and speed at the same time by steering the flow of information of all participants digitally." Community executive director, Joachim von Winning, added: "The approval of an independent authority will emphasize our competence as Europe's leading gateway for pharmaceutical products." More than half of the airlines that belong to the Community already have CEIV pharma certification, along with the Perishable Center and forwarders including Bolloré Logistics.</p>

      <p>In the third of our 'How To' series, Lionel van der Walt, chief executive and president of the Americas at PayCargo, explores the benefits of utilising Fintech in the air cargo industry</p>
      <p>Until fairly recently, the payment process in the air cargo industry was paper-based with manual processes and lengthy transaction processing times.</p>
      <p>Then digital technology came along, followed by digital banking and Fintech – which leads us to the present day situation which, across the industry industry, is a period of exciting change.</p>
      <p>We are all aware that digitalisation is happening, that it will continue to evolve – and that Fintech is booming, but how is it impacting air cargo?</p>
      <p>The short answer is, quite a lot.</p>
      <p>Fintech is the merger of financial services and digital technology, and it is being used to streamline and automate financial processes across many different industries.</p>
      <p>In air cargo, blockchain is already reducing manual processes through its record-keeping technology, its ability to provide transparency, and its resistance to modification.</p>
      <p>Online payment solutions, tools and apps are also being used to speed up transactions and as a result, the movement of goods around the world.</p>
      <p>This is a timely development as the demand for speed is only expected to increase as the e-commerce sector continues to grow and the next generation of air cargo professionals become even more tech savvy.</p>
      <p>The use of APIs (application programming interfaces) is another example of how the air cargo industry can utilise Fintech.</p>
      <p>APIs are a powerful, flexible way to enable a product or service to communicate with other products and services without having to know the details of how they work.</p>
      <p>In short, connecting software applications together through APIs can simplify application development, which in turn saves time and money. </p>
      <p>Both the air cargo and financial services industries have traditionally been resistant to change, but now is the time to follow the lead of the finance world and embrace new opportunities through technological innovation.</p>
      <p>There are many benefits to using Fintech in air cargo, but it all comes down to three key advantages: speeding up the movement of freight; modernising the industry; and securing a sustainable future for the next generation of air cargo professionals.</p>
      <p>That sounds good to me.</p>

      <p>A "game-changing" new digital cargo platform is enabling "hands-free" visibility and automated warehouse operations, using RFID.</p>
      <p>Cargocast, backed by Tigers Global, tracks each piece of cargo, pinpointing its location within a two-foot radius. Processes such as goods acceptance can then be fully automated, preventing errors, helping identify problems, and increasing efficiency for forwarders, airlines and handlers. It will also reduce costs, claimed Cargocast.</p>
      <p>The company, which has an innovation lab in Atlanta, already boasts a leading European ground handler and top-five forwarder among its clients.</p>
      <p>Cargocast is headed by chief executive Dan Diephouse, who brings more than 15 years of expertise running enterprise software businesses, most recently at MuleSoft.</p>
      <p>"We've developed proprietary processes and technology that leverage the latest advances in RFID to achieve levels of accuracy that were never before possible," he said. "This is a gamechanger for companies looking to build a strategic advantage in the air cargo industry."</p>
      <p>Former director of cargo for Air Canada Mike Morey has also joined the team.</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows that real-time, piece-level tracking is the future, but very few companies have been able to get there without a massive rip and replacement of their existing systems and processes," he explained.</p>
      <p>"Cargocast makes piece-level tracking possible, while also delivering cost savings and working with customers' existing legacy systems.</p>
      <p>"Digitisation of cargo operations is non-optional if logistics providers want to meet the quality and speed needs of today's shippers," added Mr Diephouse.</p>
      <p>"Cargocast is the only solution that can make cargo a truly digital asset, opening up new possibilities around visibility, automation, and optimisation."</p>

      <p>Cool Chain Association members have piloted a new scheme to tackle food loss by sharing temperature data from perishable consignments moving from Latin America to the Middle East.</p>
      <p>Five pallets of berries and avocados were monitored from Guadalajara, Mexico to delivery in Kuwait using loggers powered by secure Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.</p>
      <p>Partners for the pilot included Cargolux, Able Freight, Air France KLM, SmartCAE and Xtreme Technologies.</p>
      <p>Edwin Kalischnig, CEO of Xtreme Technologies, which provided the NFC loggers for the pilot says this scheme had never been done before.</p>
      <p>He says: "Once we identify gaps, we can look at where we can improve, and that is how change happens. Establishing trust is important and I hope that together we make an impact, and this is the beginning of a journey towards less food waste."</p>
      <p>Temperature movements revealed by the pilot data will be analysed by Philippe Schuler, food waste campaigner with Too Good To Go, a free smartphone app enabling users to buy leftover food from retailers.</p>
      <p>He presented preliminary findings with Kalischnig at the CCA's Perishables Conference at Fresh Park Venlo, the Netherlands on Tuesday 14 May.</p>
      <p>Schuler explained that 40% of food transported around the world needs refrigeration and 20% of food loss is caused by a breakdown in the cool chain.</p>
      <p>He says: "If you have the common objective of reducing food waste, you can achieve it, but we are not transparent across the cool chain and accountability is a problem."</p>
      <p>Schuler adds that the project is a starting point and as more data becomes available, the CCA will be able to be more scientific and develop best practices.</p>
      <p>Three NFC loggers were placed in an aircraft lower deck pallet during the pilot scheme to measure the temperature at the top, bottom and in the middle of each consignment.</p>
      <p>Schuler and Kalischnig suggested data collected during the program could be analysed in the context of a metric called Degree-Hours, which takes temperature and time into consideration to give an absolute figure against which consignments on a given journey can be measured.</p>
      <p>Eric Mauroux, director verticals and global head of perishables at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo, and CCA treasurer says: "This opens up a new way of working, where we are not pinpointing the excursion, but looking at the journey as a whole and developing solutions."</p>

    <content>
      <p>As part of its strategy to offers customers with wider choice of pharma solutions, Virgin Atlantic Cargo is first UK airline to approve the use of CSafe's new RAP container for the shipment of temperature-sensitive life-enhancing healthcare products.</p>
      <p>After its approval by the US, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), CSafe has was approved by Virgin Atlantic's own operations specialists to be carried across the airline's international network.</p>
      <p>According to the company, the CSafe RAP is the only FAA and EASA approved active compressor-driven container, which is permitted in both the upper and lower deck cargo sections of the commercial aircraft.</p>
      <p>As per the terms of its master lease agreement with CSafe, Virgin Atlantic Cargo is ready to accept bookings for the new RAP container, which will provide customers with another highly cost-efficient solution for large shipments of pharmaceutical and life science products.</p>
      <p>Virgin Atlantic Cargo already offers customers the opportunity to lease the CSafe RKN container, as well as Envirotainer's RKN t2, RAP t2, RKN e1 and RAP e2 units for temperature-controlled pharma products.</p>
      <p>The CSafe RAP uses CSafe's active temperature management system (TMS), which utilises compressor driven cooling technology and a radiant heating system-depending on the ambient temperature-in conjunction with CSafe's innovative and proprietary ThermoCor vacuum insulation panel technology.</p>
      <p>It enables the unit to maintain a strict payload temperature setting throughout transportation, regardless of the actual ambient condition.</p>
      <p>With a maximum payload weight of 4,819 kg, the CSafe RAP is designed to accept up to four US wooden pallets or five 5 Euro pallets. It can also be bulk loaded directly on the floor of the container to increase payload volume due to its unique design of the under-floor air recirculation system, which offers an extended battery run time of up to 100 hours for typical shipments.</p>
      <p>The CSafe RAP has a temperature range that is user selectable between 4 degree and 25 degree Celsius , with operational capabilities achieving desired set-points even at extreme ambient temperatures (-30 to 54 degree Celsius).</p>
      <p>Darren Sherlock, manager - products and partnerships of Virgin Atlantic Cargo said: "We are delighted to be the first UK airline to offer the CSafe RAP to our customers, extending the choice of temperature-controlled active and heating and cooling containers that Virgin Atlantic Cargo can supply. With our pharma volumes grew over 20 percent in 2017. We have recently opened of our new Pharma Zone at London Heathrow which underlines our commitment to be a leading provider of pharma transportation by offering our customers the widest choice of solutions, supported by the highest levels of customer service."</p>
      <p>Brad Jennings, vp of global marketing and partner management of CSafe Global said: "CSafe is excited to add Virgin Atlantic Cargo to the roster of airlines that have gained flight approvals for our newly developed CSafe RAP active container. The combination of Virgin Atlantic Cargo's expansive network, superior quality and performance of the CSafe RAP offers a powerful solution for transportation of temperature-sensitive products across the globel,"</p>
      <p>The growth of Virgin Atlantic Cargo's pharma volumes is supported by the reach of its global network to major pharma markets, such as UK, Europe, US, India and China. With its joint venture partner, Delta Cargo, Virgin Atlantic now offers almost one fourth of all transatlantic cargo capacity, which is the world's biggest pharma trade lane.</p>
      <p>The new Pharma Zone at Heathrow is a fully segregated area dedicated to handling and storing pharmaceutical shipments within a strictly regulated temperature environment with dedicated container storage.</p>
      <p>It incorporates two walk-in pods capable of maintaining 2-8C (COL) and 15-25 degree Celsius (CRT) temperature ranges for loose pharma shipments, and high above the floor of the Pharma Zone for added security-a temperature-controlled storage system for 24 pallets, split into six separate chambers, each of which can be safely maintained within either a 2-8C or 15-25C temperature range.</p>
      <p>Good Distribution Practice (GDP) training has also been delivered to the team of specialists working in the Pharma Zone.</p>
      <p>The airline also recently commenced its application for wholesale distribution authorisation (WDA), developed by the UK's Medicines And Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which will confirm its compliance with Good Distribution Practice (GDP).</p>

      <p>Today, Singapore-based ground handler SATS and Singaporean research platform TUMCREATE jointly announced that they are working together to explore commercialization opportunities for their artificial intelligence (AI) powered robotic air cargo system, SPEEDCARGO. SPEEDCARGO will help digitalize air cargo handling by taking over laborious processes, the companies said.</p>
      <p>SPEEDCARGO is a system comprised of three of the companies' products – CARGO EYE, CARGO MIND and CARGO ARM. CARGO EYE produces a digital fingerprint for incoming cargo by dimensioning accepted cargo in real-time using a 3D camera system. The companies are currently working to enhance CARGO MIND and CARGO ARM, which work to optimize cargo palletization through intelligent Unit Load Device (ULD) planning and automatic ULD packing, respectively, with the aim of commercializing each product in phases.</p>
      <p>The timeline for the completed project has not been released, but the integrated SPEEDCARGO system will be run on an AI-powered operating system enabling them to connect data for end-to-end optimization of cargo operations. Ultimately, companies will be able to input volume, weight and other criteria into the SPEEDCARGO system to optimize their cargo hold, SATS and TUMCREATE said.</p>
      <p>The collaboration was facilitated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), which awarded TUMCREATE S$1.9 million in its 2015 Aviation Challenge for SPEEDCARGO's prototype development over two years. The project also received S$4 million in funding from the National Research Foundation Singapore's (NRF's) Central Gap Fund, which supports public research performers in the translation of research outcomes into useful products, processes, and services that generate economic and societal benefits.</p>
      <p>"Piloting this technology in Singapore is part of our wider innovation program to enhance services and scale our operational efficiency" said SATS President and CEO Alex Hungate. "These capabilities would enhance our cargo network across Asia Pacific, along with COSYS+, our cloud-based cargo terminal management system, to augment real-time cargo visibility along our digital corridors," he added.</p>

      <p>Oman Air Cargo's new new freight facility at Muscat Airport has helped boost volumes during the first half of the year. The new cargo facility, which features a 22,780 sq m, air-conditioned warehouse with the capacity to handle 350,000 tons of cargo per annum, opened in March. The airline said that since its opening, cargo traffic has increased rapidly. In the first half of 2018 volumes were up by 25% year on year. The facility also offers 367 pallet or 734 container storage positions over three levels, as well as 2,208 Skidded Pallet Positions – all serviced by Elevating Transfer Vehicles (ETV). Accompanying these are dedicated bays that can accommodate three 'Code F Freighter' Aircraft, along with twenty-five 40ft truck parking bays, as well as 400 car parking bays and 34 truck docks. Oman Air chief executive Abdulaziz Al Raisi said: "Oman Air is proud of its new cargo facility at Muscat Airport, which apart from enhancing the operations, also provides the opportunity to boost trade and commerce opportunities for the Sultanate's economy. "Oman Air has made significant inroads in online as well as offline cargo markets and its growth trajectory has been very strong and steady. " Mohammed Ali Al Musafir, Oman Air senior vice president, commercial cargo, said: "Combined with Oman Air Cargo's track record of providing high quality services to its logistics customers, the upgraded cargo facility now aligns the company with world-class, globally competitive transport and logistics industry standards and trends." As well as the features mentioned above, the new hub will also cater for temperature sensitive traffic. The facility features bulk cold rooms (consisting of three chillers, two freezers, and one ambient room), and ULD cold rooms with 28 airline pallet positions in the chiller rooms, and eight airline pallet positions in the freezer rooms. In addition to this, there are scissor lift and ULD bypass lane facilities, as well as X-ray machines for joining and trans-shipment cargo screening. The facility also includes a 2,500 sq m live animal centre, a 228 sq m dangerous goods room (DGR) with the capacity to handle 90 skids and loose cartons, and a vulnerable goods cage with 264 pallet positions. The diplomatic room, human remains room, radioactive room and strong toom make up the remainder of the facility's handling units. The entire facility is supported by 24-hour services for import and export cargo, and its automated cargo system for documentation and warehousing, export cargo acceptance, and imports cargo delivery. The cargo facility accompanied the development of the brand new passenger terminal at Muscat International Airport, which began its first commercial operations in March 2018. "The new facility is also aligned with Oman Air's ambitious and dynamic program of fleet and network expansion," the airline said.

      <p>a) Phase 1: Construction of the new facility from June 2015b) Phase 2: Cargo management system implementation in 2016c) Phase 3: Warehouse automation integration, testing and training, which also includes the creation of a completely new operational steering model.Finnair had pumped in a total 80 million Euros for the new cool Nordic Cargo Hub at Helsinki Airport. The new cargo hub is equipped with advanced automation technology and has temperature controlled areas for pharmaceuticals and other perishable products.In an interaction with The STAT Trade Times, the airline said, "The perishables area of our new terminal opens for fish shipments in October, and the terminal will be fully operational in January 2018. As we are creating the most modern air cargo terminal concept in the world, we are entering a new territory with enormous potential, and thus it takes time to streamline our processes and ways of working to fit the new environment. When complete, all the elements of the new terminal are designed to provide a superb customer experience."Janne Tarvainen, managing director, Finnair Cargo elaborated on the automation system that is being implemented now. "In the new terminal, our cargo management system SkyChain will be connected to the warehouse automation systems and the integration of these systems will provide us with a whole new ecosystem that will enable proactive planning and steering of cargo flows and our resources. It will also allow active monitoring and immediate actions if needed. For example, in the terminal's dedicated temperature controlled areas featuring ambient monitoring sensors connected to SkyChain to prevent any deviations from shipper's instructions. In addition, the new warehouse automation and the cargo management system will provide improved reporting capabilities in response to customers' expectations of supply chain transparency."The new terminal boasts off five new elements and one of them, as mentioned earlier, is the sustainability factor. The other four are: a) cool storage features with controlled temperatures ensured for perishable goods such as fish as well as for pharma products separately in their respective 3,000 m2 areas; b) the warehouse automation combined with cargo management system; c) Advanced digitalisation including warehouse app to display information and processes using tablet computers; d) the new COOL Control Centre (CCC) concept that enables one to see everything that is going on from a network point of view.In line with the airline's commitment to lead the way towards a cleaner, caring and collaborative future, the new terminal and its features are part of Finnair Group's sustainable development plan with regard to Finnair facilities. It also supports Finnair Group's overall environmental goals, along with the modern Airbus A350 XWB fleet.The airline added that "the building itself was constructed following sustainable construction principles. Environmental aspects were also taken into account in planning the future operations models for the terminal. In addition to the 1,200 solar panels installed on the roof of the building, the equipment and functional features of the facilities – ranging from automated lighting to water usage levels and energy consumption of computers – were carefully evaluated."The new working models put in place in the terminal contribute not only to operational efficiency but also sustainability goals. For example, the automated forklift guidance will direct each forklift to attend tasks nearest to their location, which will reduce unnecessary driving in the terminal and thus make operations faster while reducing energy consumption too. To make the terminal more energy efficient, the automated ULD storage area will not require any lighting to function and the terminal's truck loading/unloading points are equipped with doors to minimise temperature impacts and cargo is loaded directly into the terminal building.Significant thrust has been given in terms of outside operations. The terminal's location is close to the wide-body aircraft stands, and this will reduce time and tarmac transport distance. The new truck yard management model will bring down unnecessary driving and idle running of trucks delivering or picking up cargo. Maintenance and waste management schedules are also part of the planning to ensure functional and sustainable operations at the terminal.One of the key features of the cool Nordic Cargo Hub is that CCC will optimise the flow of goods as well as steer the work of the hub. The warehouse automation that will find the nearest storage location for each shipment entering the AS/RS (automated sending/retrieval system) for storing shipments before/after loading to/unloading from ULDs (unit load devices, i.e. containers or pallets). The CCC will monitor the whole Finnair network and ensure that all the three parts of our Helsinki hub – the truck yard, the terminal building and the ramp transport – work in sync.</p>

      <p>The Cargocast digital cargo platform has been launched to enable freight forwarders, airlines and ground handlers to get hands-free visibility and automate their warehouse operations. These capabilities drive improvements in quality, utilisation, and door-to-door time while significantly reducing costs.</p>
      <p>Cargocast tracks each cargo piece using RFID, pinpointing cargo in a warehouse within a two-foot radius. Using this location data, processes that previously required human interaction, such as goods acceptance, can be fully automated—which helps prevent errors and increase efficiency. Additionally, providers can leverage this highly accurate data set to improve their efficiency and identify problems quickly.</p>
      <p>Cargocast is backed by Tiger Global. The company's clients include a leading European ground handler and a top-five freight forwarder. Cargocast has also launched an innovation lab in Atlanta, Georgia where they perform development and industry participants can see their solution live.</p>
      <p>Cargocast is led by CEO Dan Diephouse, who brings more than 15 years of expertise running enterprise software businesses, most recently at MuleSoft. "We've developed proprietary processes and technology that leverage the latest advances in RFID to achieve levels of accuracy that were never before possible," says Diephouse. "This is a gamechanger for companies looking to build a strategic advantage in the air cargo industry."</p>
      <p>Diephouse is joined by Mike Morey, an industry veteran and former director of cargo for Air Canada. "Everyone knows that real-time, piece-level tracking is the future, but very few companies have been able to get there without a massive rip and replacement of their existing systems and processes," says Morey. "Cargocast makes piece-level tracking possible, while also delivering cost savings and working with customers' existing legacy systems.</p>
      <p>"Digitisation of cargo operations is non-optional if logistics providers want to meet the quality and speed needs of today's shippers," says Diephouse. "Cargocast is the only solution that can make cargo a truly digital asset, opening up new possibilities around visibility, automation, and optimisation."</p>

    <content>
      <p>PayCargo has collaborated with Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Kale Logistics Solutions to set up the first air cargo community system (ACCS) in the US.The PayCargo platform underpins the ACCS, using application programming interface (API) to facilitate the integration with Kale in the system, giving all stakeholders visibility of the payment status, eliminating delays or unproductive truck trips for shipment pick-up from the hub.</p>
      <p>The ACCS allows stakeholders to communicate electronically with each other, as well as shippers, airlines, trucking companies, customs brokers, freight forwarders and cargo handlers.</p>
      <p>"It is a big thing for us to be involved with as these air cargo community systems are the future of the industry," said Lionel van der Walt, president and CEO of The Americas, PayCargo. "In Europe, they have been leading the way, but this approach has only been established here for the first time in the US."</p>
      <p>"The USA is behind the curve at the moment and this is just the start, like other airports in the USA are also talking about setting up air cargo communities. It is something that is really needed by airports to drive future growth. We are leading the way on the payment side and it is a natural progression for us to partner with companies for the future of air cargo in the USA."</p>
      <p>The ACCS also facilitates and streamlines the transportation of goods and information, to, and from, the Georgia state airport, which is one of the busiest in the USA.</p>
      <p>It has been used to eliminate duplicate data entry work, and excessive documentation, and addresses truck congestion issues, enabling improved customer focus and expedited processes."We are proud of partnering with PayCargo and happy that its payment platform is powering North America's first community system," said Amar More, director, Kale Logistics. "The integration of PayCargo within the community system, all relevant parties have the visibility of the payment status."</p>
      <p>Kale is also working with Microsoft to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into the ACCS, enabling it to handle complex airfreight-related scenarios that could arise at the airport or elsewhere in the supply chain.</p>
      <p>Since ACCS was put into operation, Atlanta reported that the system has been improving its airfreight operations and reducing overall logistics costs to enable better supply chain planning."The realisation of the first air cargo community system in North America has been one of the greatest rewards of our joint efforts," said Linda Eshiwani-Nate, senior air service development officer at Atlanta International Airport.</p>
      <p>"Add that to the fact that it all happened in less than one year, and you quickly realise that you are surrounded by a great community made up of strategic, innovative, persistent and committed leaders from all ends of the supply chain, who joined efforts in creating this system."</p>
      <p>Donna Mullins, president and CEO, Mullins International Solutions, the senior consultant to Kale in the initiative said more than 20 stakeholders had joined the ACCS, including ground handlers, freight forwarders, airlines, and trucking companies.</p>
      <p>"The ground handler Swissport has said to me that it has been beneficial to them as they know what is being picked up and what cargo is coming in and they have started pre-pooling air waybills," said Mullins.</p>

      <p>IT solutions provider Mercator has announced the launch of the Intelligent Cargo Ecosystem, the industry's first open API platform for air cargo management and ground handling. As part of this launch, Mercator will be showcasing its new Warehouse App, a transformative digital solution which enables air cargo carriers to connect goods, people, data, and processes to transform their warehousing operations.</p>
      <p>The Warehouse App is the first of a series of breakthrough applications which will be rolled out as part of Mercator's Intelligent Cargo Ecosystem. The ecosystem is the next step in the evolution of Mercator's air cargo product portfolio and encompasses a number of world leading air cargo management applications for Offer &amp; Order Management, Logistics, Warehousing, Regulatory Compliance, Quality Management, Revenue Management and Analytics.</p>
      <p>The new open architecture platform enables air cargo carriers to break away from the constraints of legacy systems by allowing handlers and operators to make process changes within the system quickly and achieve unrivalled flexibility. The app-based approach, inherent to the ecosystem, enables carriers and ground handlers to not only improve the efficiency of their operations, but also to introduce new services. For example, air cargo carriers will be able to move small consumer packages and perishable goods more effectively by having full visibility into the movements of the shipments, and by optimizing air cargo management processes to reduce delays and minimise the risk of disruption.</p>
      <p>"Mobile technology and open API platforms will revolutionise the industry, allowing carriers to get a real-time digital view of the entire air cargo supply chain. The technology can really transform the industry, providing much greater visibility, versatility, and above all, the ability to simplify complex and challenging processes," said Brendan McKittrick, Mercator's chief technology officer.</p>
      <p>The Warehouse App is a blueprint of how this ecosystem works. Fully integrated with Mercator's Intelligent Cargo Ecosystem, the app was developed after extensive consultation with hundreds of air cargo warehouse agents around the world and through Mercator's own experience of handling over 200,000 tonnes of cargo a day. This approach delivers full interoperability, enhanced security and an intuitive user experience, which are paramount for a process orientated environments.</p>
      <p>The app allows warehouse agents to capture all air cargo data through a single mobile interface and achieve full visibility into every stage of the warehouse management process, from acceptance and relocation, through to breakdown, build-up, delivery, and tracking billing data.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Warehouse App has a smart search functionality allowing the agent to search and query shipments, display SHC codes and labels, view shipment itineraries and retrieve loading details. After the cargo is scanned, the agent can track an entire shipment or a specific item within a shipment, enabling them to improve efficiency and deliver an enhanced customer experience.</p>
      <p>Finnair Cargo has been one of the first carriers to test and deploy the Warehouse App as part of its efforts to transform its air cargo and ground handling operations.</p>
      <p>Janne Tarvainen, VP head of Finnair Cargo, said, "The Warehouse App will be an important tool for years to come. The new mobile and digital system, alongside our investment in a new cargo terminal, will revolutionize Finnair's cargo system for customers and partners."</p>

      <p>GLOBAL forwarder Kuehne + Nagel has introduced an online bookings and quotations service for its air cargo customers. KN FreightNet, described as a new integrated web application for quotations, booking and tracking services, recognises an ever-increasing trend towards the use of e-commerce solutions in industry, says the Switzerland-based logistics company. Currently, quotation and booking processes in the airfreight industry are mainly handled via email or telephone. "Now, with KN FreightNet, Kuehne + Nagel customers can obtain quotes for export and import shipments online within seconds and are able to place their orders directly," says a statement. Quotations are based on a few shipment details such as place of origin, final destination, weight and volume. "Customers receive a clearly structured overview of all-inclusive prices, including fuel and security charges, for the airfreight products KN Express, KN Expert and KN Extend, as well as estimated transit times," it adds. "At this point, a booking can be made or the offer, which is valid for 14 days, can be saved." It is also possible to save shipment details as templates in the system, making it easy to re-book and compare quotes. Tracking a shipment is a smooth process with a user-friendly 'click-to-track' functionality that gives up-to-date information on the status of all consignments shipped within the last 90 days. In an initial phase of the project, KN FreightNet has been successfully trialled by selected airfreight customers in Frankfurt and Chicago. The speed and simplicity of the tool is welcomed by Risto Scherer, shipping coordinator, logistics and safety delegate, for German company Music Distribution Services. "We can easily and independently obtain airfreight quotes. Booking and tracking our shipments now only takes a few clicks. The system is really straightforward," he says. Tim Scharwath, K + N's executive vice-president of air logistics, points out: "We are proud to be a first-mover in our industry and we are committed to making processes as easy as possible for our customers. "The launch of KN FreightNet not only reflects current market needs, but also the ever-increasing trend towards e-commerce solutions." KN FreightNet will be globally available by the end of this year. Plans to develop the online solution further for seafreight and overland transport are already underway.</p>

      <p>Luxembourg-based Cargolux is bolstering its cold-chain capabilities in a new deal with temperature-controlled packaging company Thermosafe for use its PharmaPort container – an active bulk shipping container with data-collection enablement – across its international network.</p>
      <p>Cargolux is a prominent international carrier of pharmaceuticals and the first airline ever to obtain its Good Distribution Practice (GPD) certification, which outlines a framework surrounding the transport of perishable goods. It operates a network that connects Europe to destinations in the Americas, Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions, such as China and Australia.</p>
      <p>"These containers go one step further in the secure and smooth transportation of sensitive commodities," said Franco Nanna, Cargolux's director of global service.</p>
      <p>The PharmaPort is an "active" container, meaning it uses electrical systems to keep products cold for much longer than low-tech passive solutions and is able to keep products within the -40°C to 60°C range temperature stable.</p>
      <p>Christopher Day, director of business development, leasing services at Thermosafe said that the company has 300 PharmaPort units available for lease, at present, with the potential to add onto the fleet should demand increase. "One of the complaints is not being able to get active units when you want," Day said. "If somebody called and said, 'I need a PharmaPort in three days,' they can accommodate that," speaking of the Cargolux partnership.</p>
      <p>Each container is also embedded with data-collecting hardware for cloud-based track-and-trace access, meaning shippers don't have to use "drop-in" data-collecting hardware from a third-party. The containers are available to airlines on a rental basis.</p>

      <p>Heathrow transit operator Airworld Airlines has teamed up with temperature controlled equipment specialist Dawsonrentals to deliver a flexible extension to its EuroBIP airside Border Inspection Post. The rental firm has created a modular build of multi-temperature chambers with individual access and interconnecting delivery doors, all linked directly into the four major chambers of the existing facility, also installed by Dawsonrentals. Temperatures across all four original units and new facility are variable between C-35° and C+20°. Following the closure of the British Airways facility, the Airworld EuroBIP is now London Heathrow Airport's only Border Inspection Post for veterinary examination of foodstuffs for human consumption as well as products of animal origin not for human consumption entering the country by air. Originally opened in 2001, it offers ambient, chilled and frozen facilities and dedicated airside and landside transport services and has recently seen a big increase in demand. However, space for expansion at Heathrow is at a very high premium and, moreover, different products needed to be handled and stored segregated. Airworld managing director, Richard Meakes, said: "We urgently needed to add around 10% temperature controlled storage capacity to meet demand from the Port Health Authority as volumes of imports continue to grow. Also, to meet the extension of the service into animal product imports not intended for human consumption – serums, sperm, blood and so on." Products can be very varied in terms of their needs, he added. "We needed a facility that could match the ability of our existing units to change temperature quickly and efficiently to meet the demands of the various items being brought in for inspection. The Dawsonrentals units we already had were doing a good job for us but we needed the segregation. Fortunately, Dawsonrentals has a very good planning and design team, who worked closely with our team at our EuroBIP." Within the huge constraints on space, Meakes continued: "We needed to keep everything self-contained for the benefit of the PHA inspectors, as well as the integrity of the storage and handling processes, and the design, which utilised an external vehicle unloading area but then linked in through the wall of the existing building, was perfect." Senior development manager at Dawsonrentals temperature control solutions, David Quinn, said: "We carry out a lot of design, planning, supply and installation work for major companies in the pharmaceutical sector, where legislative and other demands are similarly high. "So looking at the challenges faced by Airworld was something for which our teams were very well-equipped. That said, airside space constraints at Heathrow, especially in the Cargo Village, were very difficult indeed. "However, we have great experience in developing modular approaches that maximise every opportunity, and linking into the existing building meant we could retain the vital integrity of the whole EuroBIP facility." </p>

      <p>LATAM Cargo has added a new Flex product to its portfolio of services, with the company now offering 19 different options designed to meet the specific needs of different cargo types. The new product portfolio is initially available from cargo originating in North America and Europe, while implementation in South America will take place gradually and will be concluded in the first quarter of 2017. As well its Standard and Express service, already on offer, the company will now offer Flex, which is a low-cost solution for shipments that need to arrive at the destination within a more flexible deadline but that also promises a maximum transit time of two, three or four days depending on the origin-destination and clients' preference. The company also now offers Pharma, for pharmaceutical products, Alive, for live animal transport, and Protect, for vulnerable cargo. Cristián Ureta, chief executive of LATAM Cargo, said: "The factor that most influenced our new product portfolio is the current needs of our customers. "We designed our products aligning these needs with our commercial strategy, which is based on agility, reliability and trust. Through this product portfolio, with clearly defined service standards, we seek the stable preference of our clients." To ensure the success of the new product portfolio, LATAM Cargo underwent an internal transformation over the course of a two-year period. During this time, the company developed new processes, systems and structures, as well as modified those already existing in order to meet the current needs of customers. One of the new developments is an IT system that allows LATAM Cargo to manage several commitments at the same time, identifying both the service and the care option selected at the time of booking and to ensure delivery throughout the air transportation chain. The company also recently allowed two new tracking devices to be used on its aircraft; the Sendum PT 300D and CartaSense U-Sensor, meaning it now approves seven devices. These customer property devices are inside the cargo bay and allow them to monitor the temperature, humidity, vibration, and other factors that can influence the integrity of the cargo throughout the transportation chain.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Kevin Lawler, vice president of sales at Pelican BioThermal, the specialist in temperature-controlled packaging, has offered his thoughts in an opinion piece on what the next decade will bring in terms of global cold-chain shipping.</p>
      <p>He made four predictions as to changes that will transform the pharmaceutical and cold-chain industries over the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>Cell and gene therapy</p>
      <p>Cell and gene therapies provide great promise for developing effective patient-specific treatments based on a person's unique genetic and cellular make up, Lawler noted. But these therapies come at a very high cost and add considerable complexity to cold-chain distribution, both to and from a patient.</p>
      <p>These therapies are also extremely sensitive to temperature fluctuation during transit and pharmaceutical manufacturers will demand increased confidence that these costly therapies will arrive on time, intact and at the right temperature, at their destinations, Lawler observed.</p>
      <p>Cost pressure and expanded outsourcing</p>
      <p>With increased public scrutiny on the price and accessibility of pharmaceuticals worldwide, there will be continued focus on bringing pharmaceutical prices down, Lawler opined. Cold-chain packaging providers will be asked to provide more operational services on an outsourced basis, such as support, conditioning, pick-and-pack and refurbishment — while needing to extend their global reach.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he suggested, transportation providers (3PLs and integrators) will also be asked to provide additional services such as thermal packaging, refrigeration, and pick-and-pack support. "As a result, we expect to see more alliances between packaging, transportation and contract manufacturing providers to leverage best-in-class capabilities to support increasingly cost-conscious global pharmaceutical manufacturing companies," he forecast.</p>
      <p>Technology disruption in the cold chain</p>
      <p>Technology has only recently really begun to enter the pharmaceutical cold chain, Lawler said, but it's now having more impact as the Internet of Things (IoT) progresses from concept to reality. "Pharmaceutical manufacturers are beginning to ask for real-time tracking of ambient and payload temperature, as well as RFID [radio frequency identification] for location tracking and tracing," he suggested, adding: "This will lead to more and more data being collected to assess challenging shipping lanes and distribution modes where temperature excursions and other issues arise.</p>
      <p>"With technology to provide remote temperature management, alerts and global vision, pharmaceutical manufacturers will increasingly leverage this data to make smarter cold chain transportation decisions going forward."</p>
      <p>Sustainability will affect cold-chain decision-making</p>
      <p>Initiatives such as the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) are driving corporate initiatives toward more eco-friendly practices around the world, and the pharmaceutical industry is today much more focused on reducing its environmental impact, Lawler considered.</p>
      <p>As a result, the use of reusable packaging continues to gain acceptance, and many pharmaceutical manufacturers are now requiring their vendors to demonstrate that their packaging and modes of transportation minimise negative effects on the environment, he pointed out.</p>
      <p>"Packaging providers are also being asked to provide tools to help pharmaceutical manufacturers measure their actual environmental impact so they can monitor and demonstrate their reductions in carbon footprint and waste," Lawler concluded.</p>
      <p>In other news, earlier this month (December), Pelican BioThermal announced that had achieved accreditation for technical competency within its laboratories in Europe and the US. It received ISO/IEC 17025-2017 accreditation following a rigorous certification process.</p>

      <p>United Airlines of the US and Germany's Lufthansa Cargo have now launched their long-awaited air cargo joint venture, a transatlantic partnership first mooted in 2015. Effective May 3, the two carriers will jointly manage sales and booking of standard and express shipments on routes between Europe and the US using their joint venture framework. Starting with selected routings from the US, Italy, Great Britain, Ireland and Germany, the carriers will expand the geographical scope in the coming months and plan to include additional products and features in the future. Peter Gerber, chairman and chief executive of Lufthansa Cargo, said: "The joint venture was designed to provide enhanced value to our customers. "The combination of the two strong networks offers new routing options. The co-location of our warehouses, in Munich for example, is an additional benefit, with customers needing only one location for export drop-off and import delivery. Aligned processes and quicker transfers between separate warehouses also lead to streamlined transport times." United Cargo president Jan Krems said: "Cargo customers worldwide value speed, convenience and reliability.  "Through our joint venture, United and Lufthansa Cargo offer transatlantic shippers more options that produce these benefits – including increased frequencies on a combined network accessible through either partner's booking channels. Our aligned teams and processes also deliver the superior service quality essential to our customers' success." Read more cargo Airline news</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has started work on expanding its cool centre, which will nearly double its capacity for temperature-sensitive cargo at Frankfurt Airport.</p>
      <p>Following completion, as of late summer of this year, 8,000 square metres will be available for cool chain cargo at its Lufthansa Cargo Cool Centre (LCC) up from the current 3,500 square metres.</p>
      <p>After the extension, the entire infrastructure of LCC will be further improved. It was opened in December 2011 and currently offers 4,500 square metres in four different temperature-controlled chiller rooms (2 to 8 degrees Celsius, 15 to 25°C, -12 to -20°C and 5 to 15°C) as well as a deep-freeze room and direct access to the apron. As a result, it is currently the largest hub for temperature-sensitive freight in Europe.</p>
      <p>Board member of operations, Sören Stark says at a ground-breaking ceremony to mark the start of work: "We've gained a great deal of experience in the worldwide transport of sensitive medications. CEIV certification from IATA has recently highlighted this.</p>
      <p>"The excellent collaboration with numerous shippers from the pharmaceutical and chemical industries has prompted demand for our service to grow consistently. We're delighted to be able to offer our customers even more capacity and flexibility in our Cool Center as early as late summer."</p>
      <p>In late 2016, IATA awarded the CEIV Pharma seal of approval for pharmaceutical transport to Lufthansa Cargo and the LCC. The carrier says it improves the service continuously, taking into account the needs of the pharmaceutical industry as well as all the prerequisites from the EU GDP (Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use).</p>

      <p>American Airlines Cargo has chosen IBS Software's iCloud as its next generation cargo management system, which it says will transform the airline's technology across the network.</p>
      <p>Using iCloud, the airline will migrate to a web-based, fully integrated technology platform connecting all of its critical business functions.</p>
      <p>The two companies are designing a multi-year, phased implementation and rollout strategy, which ensures the new technology and processes are brought into the business in a seamless manner.</p>
      <p>The airline says it is committed to taking an iterative approach to the implementation to ensure day-to-day business functions run smoothly during the transition, minimising the impact go live will have on partners and customers.</p>
      <p>American Airlines Cargo president, Rick Elieson says: "We are focused on modernising processes for our team, and increasing transparency and flexibility for our customers. The rapidly changing cargo landscape demands that we invest in the best of tools, so that our team can focus on doing what they do best—delivering an exceptional customer experience."</p>
      <p>IBS Group executive chairman, VK Mathews says: "The iCargo footprint is now truly global and having American among our growing list of customers is indeed a strategic milestone for IBS. The engagement, I am sure, will herald the beginning of a long and productive business relationship."</p>

      <p>Kuehne + Nagel is set to expand its capabilities in the final-mile delivery sector, signing a partnership deal with logistics services solutions provider Zebraxx.</p>
      <p>The agreement will enable K+N to offer additional methods for collecting and sharing delivery information, such as real-time vehicle location, photographic evidence of the state of consignments and delivery confirmation, IoT validation or electronic proof-of-delivery (ePOD), independently from backbone systems and carriers used.</p>
      <p>Customers will be further integrated in the data exchange via enhanced functionalities on mobile devices, like alerts or ePOD via social message platforms, and it will work with K+N's monitoring and visibility platform KN Login, which means shippers will benefit from a standardised single source for all delivery information.</p>
      <p>K+N head of contract logistics Gianfranco Sgro said: "We are seeing an increasing need for improved visibility solutions to service our customers. As our environment becomes more and more digital, customers are demanding greater flexibility and options in the solutions we can offer them and all at a lower cost.</p>
      <p>"Zebraxx has demonstrated a willingness to embrace innovative and imaginative ideas and transform them into valuable solutions for our business and our customers."</p>
      <p>The agreement builds on the existing relationship between the two companies, with some 10m transactions handled by the Zebraxx system in 2017.</p>
      <p>Bernd Heymanns, MD of Zebraxx said: "We are in a long-lasting working relationship with Kuehne + Nagel. This formalisation and commitment to partnership brings our companies closer and provides the platform for us to work on some exciting projects together, enhancing last-mile shipment visibility for the customers worldwide."</p>

      <p>AEROTUF's latest ULD innovation, the AeroTHERM Extra Cool, was showcased as part of Boeing's ecoDemonstrator 777 programme.</p>
      <p>In November, the ecoDemonstrator 777 aircraft, which offers the chance to test eco-technology in the air, made its way to Germany where it was greeted by more than 1,000 people who were keen to explore promising aviation technologies onboard the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Romar Frazier, BCA Advanced Concepts at Boeing, explained: "Sustainability is fundamental to the ecoDemonstrator programme. We collaborate with partners such as AEROTUF to test technologies under real-life conditions in the air to accelerate innovation for the future of aviation."</p>
      <p>The new AeroTHERM Extra Cool is a temperature-controlled container that tests and records temperature and performance.</p>
      <p>Tom Pherson, president at AEROTUF, commented: "This new Extra Cool AeroTHERM model, further expands our temperature protective range, delivering even greater insulation to help keep perishable cargo cooler for longer, further reducing material and food waste, whilst maximizing durability, thanks to patented foam-core technology, standard in all AeroTHERM containers from 2020."</p>
      <p>Adam Barrington-Spencer, vice president of sales and marketing at AEROTUF, added: "We're pleased to support Boeing and its continued push for excellence, innovation and a more sustainable future.</p>
      <p>"Today a third of the world's food produced goes to waste, with 40% directly lost through the air cargo supply chain. Our new Extra Cool AeroTHERM container will help to reduce that waste, while improving handling times and saving on materials cost.</p>
      <p>"This latest innovation further demonstrates our commitment towards a cleaner environment, by delivering stronger, safer &amp; greener ULD solutions."</p>

      <p>Senior executives of global air cargo airlines that assembled in Bangkok sounded out to their counterparts in the industry to take the critical step – embrace disruptive new-gen technology to remain relevant in an increasingly digital world. In a market that continues to remain challenging, abandoning the cumbersome legacy IT system to gain efficiency and control cost of operations is one key way forward to remain competitive, it was echoed.</p>
      <p>"Air freight industry revenues have dropped from USD 67 billion in 2011 to USD 48 billion in 2016, despite a rise in volumes. Entry of non-traditional disruptive players and formation of alliances among ocean freighters are posing huge challenges. Besides, customers are increasingly becoming more discerning on product differentiation, costs and service efficiency. All these mean that there is an urgent need to devise new strategies on how the air cargo industry conducts business going forward. Stakeholders need to embrace digitisation and leverage digital technology for transforming its internal and external operations to stay ahead of the competition," said VK Mathews, executive chairman of IBS Software in his opening remark. He was speaking at the 11th edition of 'IBS Cargo Forum' to an audience of over 45 senior representatives of leading air cargo airlines and service providers from across the globe.</p>
      <p>Spread over two days, IBS Cargo Forum discussed in detail the role of technologies such as 'Blockchain Technology' and 'Robotic Process Automation' in the air cargo industry. These topics attain significance in the context of the disruption affected by this new generation business approaches and technologies in all spheres of air travel leading to the need for air cargo industry to modernise its technology for better operations and customer engagement. Several cargo-specific use cases and prototypes were showcased in specially designed 'Experience Booths' allowing participants to gain a first-hand experience in the potential application of cutting edge technologies.</p>
      <p>"We are inspired by what we saw; especially the prototypes in the technology experience booths for smart warehouses and the views on blockchain and RPA in the cargo industry. It's very exciting to see a technology company thinking from a customer perspective and designing solutions that really benefit us" said a forum delegate.</p>
      <p>The IBS Air Cargo Forum, a community body representing stakeholders in the air cargo industry is organised twice every year to discuss the key issues shaping the global air cargo industry, share insights on some of the critical challenges facing the industry and focus on how advancements in technology could be leveraged to optimise cost of operations and improve yields. User group sessions are also held to brainstorm and influence the future direction of IBS' award winning cargo management software, iCargo.</p>

      <p>Chicago, Illinois-based air cargo technology developer Hangar A has launched its digital air logistics platform for shippers moving goods within the US.</p>
      <p>The software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution offers real-time visibility of the supply chain, enabling shippers to book, track and manage their air cargo shipments – thus eliminating many manual tasks involved in the process and reducing transaction time by up to 60%, Hangar A said.</p>
      <p>Other features of the platform include on-demand analytics and decision support tools such as intelligent flight search to optimise routing, dynamic rate management to find pricing advantages, cost and performance metrics, and online tools to evaluate alternative shipping options.</p>
      <p>Shippers can use the platform to build and manage their supply chain, or outsource the fulfilment process to Hangar A's Transportation Security Administration-certified logistics team under the firm's Logistics-as-a-Service (LaaS) offering. Either way, the customer has full visibility of the air freight process from start to finish.</p>
      <p>Kevin Kerns, Hangar A chief executive, said: "In today's highly competitive market, shippers are facing tremendous price pressures and increasing consumer demand for faster delivery services. Utilising Hangar A's innovative air logistics platform, shippers have the opportunity to cut total transportation and labour costs by up to 20%."</p>
      <p>Judith Taylor, an independent supply chain consultant, described the platform as a "game changer" that will "give companies the opportunity to compete without having to invest millions of dollars in logistics systems infrastructure".</p>

      <p>In line with its digital-first policy, Etihad Cargo has signed a distribution agreement with multi-airline e-booking platform cargo.one. The agreement was finalised on the sidelines of Cargo Connect during the ongoing 2019 Dubai Airshow.</p>
      <p>The agreement will empower Etihad Cargo to offer an additional avenue for bookings on available cargo capacity to a wider pool of European customers. Etihad Cargo's addition to cargo.one will give forwarders in Europe access to new markets across the Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, Asia, Africa, Australasia and US – including Sydney, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta.</p>
      <p>Abdulla Mohamed Shadid, managing director of cargo and logistics services, Etihad Aviation Group said, "Etihad Cargo's ambition to lead the industry into a new digital era has driven significant investment in our digitalisation programme across back of house and customer facing platforms in the last 12 months. This landmark partnership with cargo.one builds on the success we have achieved on our own online platform, etihadcargo.com, which now represents 38 per cent of our bookings."</p>
      <p>"Our digital investment enabled us to rapidly build the required API connectivity to seamlessly link to the cargo.one platform. Through cargo.one we will offer global capacity to users on new routings and to new destinations across our extensive worldwide network, and provide our own customers with additional booking choice," added Shadid.</p>
      <p>"cargo.one is the number one choice for airlines to foster digitalisation and to put their customers first. Our fast-growing user base not only makes it attractive for airlines to join as a means of reaching new customers, but also helps them to serve their customers' needs in the best possible way. With Etihad Cargo on board we strengthen our market position as the leading distribution channel for cargo airlines and further grow our offering for freight forwarders," said Moritz Claussen, managing director, cargo.one.</p>
      <p>The online platform serves more than 300 freight forwarding companies across Europe. After a phased roll-out starting November 18, Etihad's capacities will become available on the cargo.one platform in all major European markets.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has launched a next-generation version of its innovative protection product for valuable temperature-sensitive cargo, such as pharmaceutical products.</p>
      <p>The carrier says White Cover Advanced, utilises DuPont's patented Tyvek material made of high density polyethylene to form a tough protective barrier against varying external temperatures and direct sunlight.</p>
      <p>The special material is water resistant to prevent moisture damage while at the same time breathable, thereby reducing condensation and dryness. It is also environmentally friendly and is 100 per cent recyclable.</p>
      <p>The White Cover Advanced is an enhanced offering to Emirates SkyCargo's existing White Cover. While the White Cover is used for perishables, such as vegetables and fresh fruits, it also Advanced offers additional protection for packaged pharmaceutical shipments in controlled room temperature (CRT) range in an insulated packaging.</p>
      <p>Weighing no more than three kilograms for Emirates' largest passenger aircraft pallet, the special sheet completely encloses the shipment and allows for cooling during transportation and cold storage and takes two people no more than eight minutes to wrap a pallet.</p>
      <p>Emirates' cargo operations worldwide senior vice president, Henrik Ambak says: "The pharmaceutical industry moves products worth over $1 trillion annually. Temperature changes during transportation can pose a serious threat to the integrity of these sensitive products.</p>
      <p>"They must be kept within different control room temperature (CRT) bands in accordance with the revised EU Good Distribution Practice. The White Cover Advanced, with its silver-coating technology, provides a reliable and affordable means of protecting these products from temperature spikes during air transportation."</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo range of advanced protective techniques and services in transporting perishable products include: Cool Chain Premium, Cool Chain Advanced and Cool Chain Standard, each of which is designed to meet specific requirements of customers.</p>
      <p>This includes the Emirates SkyCargo Cool Dolly, equipment that transports cargo from the aircraft to cool storage areas, while maintaining temperatures of as a low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>The cool chain portfolio is supported by Emirates SkyCargo's temperature-controlled handling facilities at both its freighter terminal in Dubai World Central's (DWC) at Al Maktoum International Airport and its Cargo Mega Terminal in Dubai International Airport.</p>

      <p>BERLIN — Cargo 2000, the 82-member IATA specialist interest group, has finally moved beyond the turn of the millennium and changed its name officially to Cargo iQ. The group also recently embarked on its new Smart Data Project, which will add 110 million lines of performance data annually, enabling Cargo iQ  members to further improve their processes, said Ariaen Zimmerman, executive director of Cargo iQ.</p>
      <p>"Cargo iQ members work together to measure success and continuously improve the value of airfreight for customers," he said. "We have successfully developed a system with clear milestones and unique route maps, and, thanks to our reliable monitoring, members can improve their services to customers."</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo also announced it has joined the organization as a full member for the first time after having had an observer on the board for the past year. "Having the biggest air cargo carrier on the planet amongst our new members just adds to that excitement," Zimmerman said.</p>
      <p>Max Sauberschwarz, chairman of Cargo iQ's Membership Board, and Kuehne + Nagel's global head of carrier and gateway air logistics, said he was looking forward to the rebrand building positive momentum for the organization's work in the industry.</p>
      <p>"Cargo iQ stands for collaboration, trust, quality, reliability, and innovation," he said. "Our organization provides value for our members and for the air freight industry and we are excited to be progressing with the new name now, based on the achievements of the group to date."</p>
      <p>Nabil Sultan, divisional senior vice president for cargo, Emirates SkyCargo, said Cargo iQ dovetails nicely with SkyCargo's customer service goals. "We have been following CargoiQ's development over the years," he said, "and are impressed with the solid initiatives it has developed, including the Master Operating Plan, which was conceptualized to support the implementation of quality management processes and metrics. With the rebranding of Cargo iQ and the launch of their strategic transformation program, we felt that the time was right to become a member."</p>
      <p>Cargo iQ measured 10 million airport-to-airport and 5.5 million door-to-door shipments in 2015, enabling members to take action to improve and standardize internal processes by identifying where quality was an issue. By speaking the same language, Cargo iQ members are also able to follow best practices and define common processes with industry partners in the supply chain.</p>
      <p>This year, the group will implement a new audit and certification scheme, focused on increasing international recognition for the Cargo iQ Quality Management System Certification.</p>
      <p>"The air cargo industry continues to face enormous challenges, and in order to fulfil the value proposition shippers demand, we must focus much more on delivering quality," said Glyn Hughes, global head of cargo, IATA. "Cargo iQ's new approach to benchmarking and the use of smart data will help ensure we can indeed meet that objective."</p>

      <p>Outsourced ULD management services provider Jettainer has taken over the online platform skypooling, a free tool that helps participating airlines to maintain better control over their ULDs by keeping track of ULD over- or under-stocking and enabling carriers with a similar airport network to coordinate their ULD efforts and help each other to balance their ULD stocks.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Jettainer confirmed, it has already started work on the expansion and further development of the platform.</p>
      <p>skypooling and Jettainer jointly announced the acquisition and planned innovations during the Air Cargo Europe / transport logistic event being held in Munich this week (June 4 to 7).</p>
      <p>skypooling founder Willem-Jan Loomans was looking for a suitable partner and, Loomans informed: "Jettainer was chosen because the company has made an excellent name for itself both with ULD management as well as generally in the creation and development of ULD-relevant IT systems and tools."</p>
      <p>Jettainer has been an active user of the platform for many years but also saw further significant potential that could be realised.</p>
      <p>"The complete coordination of ULD rental will take place via the platform: From automated processes, direct booking confirmation and communication to all parties involved to recording the issue and return of ULDs," said Christine Klemmer, general manager of skypooling.</p>
      <p>The new version of the platform will include a modernised front end, with improvements to make it easier for users to locate ULDs as desired.</p>
      <p>It is scheduled to go online in the autumn of 2019. In addition, Jettainer is already planning other new features. For example, a lost &amp; found function and insurance services are to be integrated.</p>
      <p>"We are making supply and demand in the ULD environment transparent and will bring together parties who would otherwise not have found each other so easily," Klemmer asserted.</p>
      <p>"This enables us to offer solutions that would not have been possible before."</p>
      <p>As a result of all the changes, "skypooling thus becomes a one-stop shop, the online marketplace for searching and offering containers and pallets," Klemmer said.</p>
      <p>The current basic functionalities of the simple ULD platform are to remain free of charge.</p>
      <p>The network currently has around 100 members and almost all of the existing airline members have already migrated to the new owner.</p>
      <p>Jettainer is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lufthansa Cargo. It is currently responsible for the control, positioning, maintenance and repair of around 90,000 ULDs for 22 airlines.</p>
      <p>It currently operates at over 450 airports worldwide. Based outside Raunheim, near Frankfurt am Main, Jettainer has offices at the central hubs of international airlines in Abu Dhabi, Dallas/Fort Worth, Rome and Zurich as well as an operational base in Mumbai.</p>

    <content>
      <p>El Al has joined an online booking platform, claiming there is less risk in getting involved early than in leaving it late.</p>
      <p>As the carrier announced it had joined Lufthansa and AirBridgeCargo on the cargo.one platform, Ronan Spira, head of cargo for El Al, said: "To be frank, there is probably less risk in entering a young market and learning under those conditions than arriving late to a developed market without a good understanding of how to participate effectively.</p>
      <p>"I can imagine other carriers either believe they do not have resources or the right knowledge in place to begin a digital distribution project. However, this threshold is much lower when working with a capable partner."</p>
      <p>It took 12 weeks to integrate El Al onto the platform, and it has now made its first online booking, with Hellmann for a shipment from Frankfurt to Miami.</p>
      <p>"Being able to see bookable offers of different airlines … at a glance, makes it ten times easier for us to find and book the right offer," said Hellmann export operator Robin Keilmann.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Spira said airfreight still had a long way to go in its digital efforts.</p>
      <p>"A lot of inefficiency and friction exist today in how airfreight is booked and in how data quality is ensured throughout the process following bookings. Not only can inefficiency be removed, but the responsiveness of the air freight supply chain will be improved with digitalisation.</p>
      <p>"Progressing down this journey as early as possible allows us to develop our capabilities over the coming months and years. There are no opportunity costs … and it makes complete sense for an airline to start these projects as early as possible."</p>
      <p>But he added this was just the first part of a journey for El Al.</p>
      <p>"There remain many business processes to digitise and integrations to improve. This is a journey and while we have now taken the first steps, we need to drive what we have already learned, continue to learn and execute on it."</p>
      <p>Digitisation does not only concern the booking process. Virgin Atlantic and Delta Cargo's new export facility at Heathrow has embraced new technology, which will deliver "significant improvements and transparency", claim the carriers.</p>
      <p>While the headline news is that the dnata City East facility offers the airlines double the handling capabilities they previously had, the facility also offers Gatehouse technology.</p>
      <p>This means drivers arriving no longer need to leave their vehicles to complete documentation processes and are immediately assigned to a cargo door to offload their freight. They also receive text message updates to help expedite cargo deliveries.</p>
      <p>Real-time acceptance using the operation's door management system and hand-held technology provides instant freight status update messages for customers to confirm their cargo is being handled and flown as planned. Screens inside the facility, linked directly to the airlines' operations control centres, enable flight monitoring and the management of service level agreements. The facility also has new x-ray technology with enhanced imaging capability, reducing the need for secondary cargo screening.</p>
      <p>"The technology enhancements and the transparency across the export operation, with increased temperature-controlled facilities, are designed to make it easier for our customers to work with both airlines," said Rafael Figueroa, Delta Cargo's managing director – operations and customer experience.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Kuehne + Nagel has expanded its global perishables network with the acquisition of CFI (Commodity Forwarders Inc) an airfreight forwarder of perishables products in the US, and Trillvane Ltd, one of the largest perishables specialists in Kenya.</p>
      <p>These it says will add more than 150,000 tonnes of perishables to the forwarder's perishables network and further "strengthens its position in providing end-to-end international and domestic fresh chain solutions".</p>
      <p>CFI was established in 1974 by Alfred Kuehlewind as one-man office in Los Angeles shipping strawberries to Europe, and now operates 14 locations throughout the US including Alaska and Hawaii with more than 700 employees.</p>
      <p>The company is specialised in airfreight export and import as well as distribution of seafood, all kinds of agricultural products, flowers and greens.</p>
      <p>CFI founder and chief executive officer, Alfred Kuehlewind says: "We are looking forward to become part of the Kuehne + Nagel Group. The planned transaction will offer us new growth perspectives and access to a global logistics network. Both companies' customers will benefit from an extended service scope."</p>
      <p>The acquisition of Trillvane Ltd will enable Kuehne + Nagel to strengthen its position in perishables operations between Kenya and Europe, in particular to the UK.</p>
      <p>The company has 130 employees and is specialised in the export of flowers and vegetables and is located at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi.</p>
      <p>Kuehne + Nagel member of the management board responsible for airfreight logistics, Yngve Ruud says: "The two acquisitions mark another important step in our global perishable logistics strategy. These two transactions further strengthen and expand our fresh chain network connecting key production countries to major consumer markets.</p>
      <p>"The business potential in the steadily growing global perishable sector is huge. Based on our dedicated network – by now the largest in the logistics industry for perishables – and globally integrated IT systems we can scale business opportunities and accelerate our growth in this sector with end-to-end transparency.</p>
      <p>"At the same time, we improve our global and national positioning in airfreight. Together with CFI Kuehne + Nagel becomes the number two airfreight forwarder in the US and the acquisition of Trillvane confirms our leading position in Kenya."</p>
      <p>Kuehne + Nagel says all parties agreed not to disclose the purchase price and both transactions are subject to customary closing conditions and clearance by the merger control authorities.</p>

      <p>Tech company CalAmp has signed a partnership with software-as-a-service provider CargoSense to deliver information on high-value, sensitive air cargo for "one of the world's largest global airlines headquartered in the US." The platform will use data collected from CalAmp's SC1000 and SC1100  telematics gateways and smart sensor tags that monitor location, temperature, humidity, shock, light and vibration for pharmaceuticals, wine, electronics, live freight and perishables shipments that require environmental monitoring. The system will then analyse the aggregated data to detect critical environmental conditions and movement patterns from one flight segment to the next, tom give the airline greater insight into shipment processes and to help meet mandatory reporting requirements for high-value cargo. Senior vice president and general manager of CalAmp's Software and Subscription Services business, Paul Washicko, said: "We are pioneering an effective and efficient way of maintaining control and monitoring the condition of high-value cargo with detailed real-time environmental data to optimize safe transport from departure to arrival." CargoSense chief executive, Richard Kilmer, added:  "Through our partnership with CalAmp, the global airline will gain real-time insights into the exact status of all its cargo through our comprehensive logistics solution that is unparalleled in transport monitoring today."</p>

      <p>IATA presented a certificate of recognition for the airport community's pharma efforts at the World Cargo Symposium in Abu Dhabi. IATA senior vice president, airport, passenger, cargo and security, Nick Careen, handed over the certificate to Schiphol cargo director to Jonas van Stekelenburg in recognition of Schiphol's support for its Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) programme. IATA's global head of cargo Glyn Hughes commented: "The European freight market is one of the largest in the world, accounting for close to a quarter of total global trade. "Having Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Europe's third largest freight airport, and Air Cargo Netherlands, one of the region's largest operators, support the CEIV Pharma Program is a significant boost for meeting shippers' expectations in terms of standardisation and transparency across the supply chain in the region. "We thank them for their support and for taking the industry one step closer to having a global standard for transporting pharmaceuticals in place." Pharma Gateway Amsterdam (PGA) was formed a year ago to provide a transparent and qualified pharma air cargo supply chain. To become PGA members, organisations must gain CEIV certification, with support and guidance throughout the process. All 13 members of PGA are now working to develop an 'early warning system' for pharma shippers who are asking for clarity in the pharma supply chain. Jonas van Stekelenburg said: "It makes perfect sense that all PGA members become IATA CEIV -certified. IATA understands exactly what to look at when assessing the quality of the pharma supply chain, and receiving the accreditation assures our customers that at Schiphol, they are receiving the highest quality service." The 13 members of PGA are Cyberfreight, GEFCO, VCK Logistics, Yusen Logistics, Swissport, Dnata, Worldwide Flight Services (WFS), Air France-KLM, De Jong Special Services, Jan de Rijk Logistics, Nouwens Breda, DJ Middelkoop, and SGS.</p>

    <title>IBS to offer SENTRY tracking as part of iCargo system</title>

      <p>OnAsset Intelligence, the Texas-headquartered supplier of asset-tracking technologies in the logistics industry, has agreed a deal with IT systems provider IBS that will see the full integration of OnAsset's product suite with IBS's air cargo management system, iCargo. As a result, OnAsset's SENTRY 500 FlightSafe cargo monitoring device will be offered to customers as an integral part of the iCargo system. It will add to its capability, rather than replace any existing systems. "We've been working with IBS since last year," explained OnAsset chief executive, Adam Crossno. Driven by the desire to equip the freight industry with additional value-adding technologies that will allow important information to be derived and shared more quickly and more effectively, OnAsset had looked at various partners, he said. The opportunity to add the capability of the SENTRY FlightSafe device and thereby give iCargo customers its real-time visibility of location and condition data was not one to miss. SENTRY, which has been certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and approved and used by numerous major airlines, offers users data on the location of their cargo, its condition and in whose possession it is. This data can now all be made available as part of IBS's iCargo management system, enabling the latter's users to quickly react to any problems or unexpected developments. Moreover, that data can also be used as critical information for longer term operational planning, Crossno pointed out. Customers don't need to worry about regulatory compatibility. OnAsset has already taken care of all that, Crossno continued. This Internet of Things-related capability already has full interoperability with IATA's messaging standards, and can be seen as another important move towards the day when the industry is characterised by full eFreight capability, with relevant documents and data all shared quickly and without the need for paper between the relevant links in the airfreight supply chain. Ashok Rajan, vice president and head of air cargo business at IBS was equally as enthusiastic about the tie-up between the companies' offerings. "The air cargo industry is at the threshold of a new phase of change and needs ways and means to differentiate the services that it offers to its customers," he enthused. "Being able to offer specialised and tailored products and services is key to the success of air cargo carriers and service providers in high growth segments such as pharma. "Our industry leading solution iCargo provides integrated capabilities for planning, monitoring and delivering high quality for high value products. Our aim is to take that even further through real time integration with sensors and monitoring devices – often referred to as the 'Internet of Things'. "The capability to offer iCargo 'pre-wired' to real time tracking devices takes it to the next level of capability," Rajan concluded. Natural expectation The sort of real-time supply chain visibility offered by a system such as SENTRY FlightSafe is becoming a "natural expectation" within the logistics industry, Crossno said. The capability not only to monitor a shipment throughout a complex multimodal movement, but also technology that allows that data to be used as a tool to both quickly deal with issues and as part of a wider electronic freight shipping environment in which all freight partners do business, will become the norm, he believes. "Our desire is for our solution to be as readily consumed as possible," Crossno informed. This sort of deal with IBS allows that to take place, for users to integrate SENTRY as a flexible tool within their own day-to-day operational processes, he concluded.</p>

    <content>
      <p>The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) is establishing a new working group to define and deliver a sustainability programme for the air cargo industry.  </p>
      <p>To support the initiative, TIACA has signed a long-term partnership agreement with CHAMP Cargosystems. </p>
      <p>One of the highlights of the project is launching a yearly Air Cargo Sustainability Award, starting at TIACA's Executive Summit (ES) taking place in November in Budapest, Hungary. </p>
      <p>TIACA and CHAMP will also work with members, partners, and industry representatives to establish a common vision on sustainability and create a sustainability committee, which will build the Program and monitor delivery of the initiatives.</p>
      <p>The association has pledged to organise at least one panel discussion or presentation focused on sustainability at each of its events.</p>
      <p>"Sustainable development means being able to meet the business needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to find solutions to their own commercial challenges," stated Steven Polmans, incoming Chairman of TIACA and Director Cargo and Logistics at Brussels Airport Company</p>
      <p>He added: "In the aviation and air cargo logistics sector, in common with all parts of our society, sustainability has an increasingly important role to play.</p>
      <p>"The development of long-term strategies and investment to achieve a sustainable industry is key to guaranteeing the future of air cargo and TIACA, as the only organisation representing all sectors of the supply chain, is in a unique position to drive that development." </p>
      <p>"CHAMP Cargosystems is extremely pleased to establish this sustainable initiative in partnership with TIACA," said Arnaud Lambert, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at CHAMP Cargosystems.</p>
      <p>"Our commitment stands to jointly create a program that will have a positive global outcome − first for society and then for business. Sustainability is a subject often considered in the development of our IT solutions like CO2 emission calculator solutions, integration, or paper free solutions for the air cargo business but is definitely not limited to this only.</p>
      <p>"We are looking forward to defining and implementing strategies for achieving positive and substantial results in Optimizing our Environmental Footprint (OEF) and minimizing logistics-related emissions or waste, for example.</p>
      <p>"All this can only be done in synergetic collaboration with all industry players. Ultimately, each of us is responsible for tomorrow's world and we are accountable for the future state of the Earth − not only for us, but also for those who will inherit it."</p>

      <p>DHL Medical Express Service has been launched between Brazil and the USA for customers in the pharmaceutical and clinical research sectors.</p>
      <p>The service was piloted in Brazil in November 2018 to address customer demands for faster and more predictable lead times, given the regulatory complexities that can delay exports.</p>
      <p>The medical service lets DHL manage the export and regulatory requirements for urgent shipments with specific temperature needs from several major Brazilian cities to most US destinations in 24 to 48 hours.</p>
      <p>Service points in Brazil have been upgraded and validated to meet federal, state and city regulations around Ministry of Health and Sanitary controls and licencing requirements.</p>
      <p>Mike Parra, CEO of DHL Express Americas says: "The launch of this service in Brazil completes our ambition to offer logistics solutions in the Latin and South American countries where most clinical trials are conducted. Our strong international network, compliant certifications and combination of responsiveness, reliability and cost-effectiveness will enable this service to be advantageous to all stakeholders in the clinical trial value chain."</p>
      <p>The implementation of the DHL Medical Express Service clinical trial platform at DHL Express Brazil includes a dedicated Customer Service Center with bilingual staff and an onboarding team to support investigator sites.</p>
      <p>The service includes dry ice supplies and temperature-controlled fulfillment, online tools for placing bookings and ordering supplies, and a web-based interface that connects sites.</p>
      <p>Brian Bralynski, director of life sciences healthcare Americas at DHL Express says: "Given the complexity of regulatory requirements in Brazil, our technology solution pre-prepares many of the necessary documents required by investigator sites to complete, while enabling DHL to begin the export and fiscal approval process the day-of- booking to mitigate delays."</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has stepped up its cooperation with digital booking platform cargo.one, acquiring a minority share in the Berlin-based company.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2017, cargo.one has developed a platform for booking and marketing air cargo capacity, and offers dynamic spot rates.</p>
      <p>Peter Gerber, CEO of Lufthansa Cargo described cargo.one as "another important step towards the digitisation of our industry".</p>
      <p>"We are pleased to have been one of the first airlines to recognise the potential of this multi-airline platform for our customers and to have made ourselves compatible. We are impressed with the technology and user-friendly product.</p>
      <p>"Our customers' overall experience is now strongly improved by being able to more efficiently book air cargo capacity."</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has made a series of partnerships with tech companies. It invested this year in US start-up Fleet Logistics, an online marketplace which matches customer demand with available capacity provided by logistics companies.</p>
      <p>The carrier is also anchor partner to US technology accelerator Plug and Play, which brings start-ups and established companies together within the supply chain and logistics platform. The programme provides an opportunity for logistics players to network with, and learn from, each other, exchange ideas and drive digitisation.</p>
      <p>"The close cooperation between Lufthansa Cargo and technology start-ups melds comprehensive air cargo experience with a technology driven, fresh view of global logistics processes," said Boris Hueske, head of digital transformation at Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>"By acquiring a share in cargo.one and Fleet Logistics, Lufthansa Cargo is emphasising its strategic commitment to elevating the air cargo industry to a higher level of digital maturity," added Mr Hueske.</p>

      <p>Panalpina's newly opened Healthcare Logistics Center in Weiterstadt near Frankfurt/Main Airport has obtained Good Distribution Practice (GDP) certification.</p>
      <p>On August 6, the facility has successfully passed an audit by inspection, verification, testing and certification company SGS and is now certified according to EU GDP.</p>
      <p>This brings the logistics provider's global network of GDP-certified locations to 38.</p>
      <p>The new facility is close to Frankfurt/Main international airport, major highways and Germany's federal road infrastructure.</p>
      <p>"Since the new center is so close to Frankfurt airport, as well as [other] major European ports, it is a gateway to the world for healthcare products," said Stephen Kay, regional manager for Panalpina's Healthcare industry vertical.</p>
      <p>"In combination with Panalpina's other European centers of excellence, we have a highly flexible set-up where we can move products to every continent by air or ocean freight and using either active or passive cooling. Based on the customers' requirements, we can also choose between commercial carriers or the Panalpina Charter Network with its main hub in nearby Luxembourg."</p>
      <p>Some 4,500 sq m of temperature-controlled warehouse space of the Frankfurt/Main facility are dedicated to healthcare customers; another 4,600 sq m are for multipurpose use, while an additional 620 sq m is office space.</p>
      <p>Of the healthcare-dedicated part, 3,500 sq m cover temperatures from 15°C to 25°C, with three dedicated truck docks, and 1,000 sq m cover temperatures from 2°C to 8°C, with two dedicated truck docks.</p>
      <p>The warehouse has more than 6,000 pallet locations, an X-ray machine in the temperature-controlled area, and is able to handle dangerous goods.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt is Panalpina's third logistics facility in Germany's Rhein-Main region, alongside Moerfelden and Neu-Isenburg.</p>

      <p>All cargo airline AirBridgeCargo (ABC) has received Envirotainer's QEP accreditation at its global hub at Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport and in Dallas, one of its six online gateways in the US.</p>
      <p>Envirotainer, which has been delivering innovative Active containers for secure cold chain solutions for over 30 years, created its Qualified Envirotainer Provider Training and Quality Programme (QEP) to recognise transport service providers which demonstrate their ability to properly manage Envirotainer container shipments in accordance with Good Distribution Practices (GDP).</p>
      <p>Fedor Novikov, director Pharma, Global at AirBridgeCargo, said, "We have been heavily involved in pharma transportation since 2016 and our focus over the last 18 months has been to invest in developing the products and services our customers need. QEP accreditation is one of the benchmarks we and our customers recognise as being very important as we grow pharma volumes across our network."</p>
      <p>In November 2016, AirBridgeCargo also became the first airline in Russia and only the seventh carrier in the world to receive IATA CEIV Pharma certification, which addresses the need for more safety, security, compliance and efficiency through a globally consistent pharmaceutical product handling certification programme.</p>
      <p>In developing its pharma product, ABC has conducted lane assessments to understand each international station's readiness to handle pharma shipments. This included strict audits of Ground Handling Agents and Ramp Agents as well as audits of trucking companies and other outsourced partners, including checks of their Quality Management Systems.</p>
      <p>Chris Fore, Compliance manager at Envirotainer, said, "As one of the world's fastest-growing all-cargo airlines and with a network serving major pharmaceutical markets and trade lanes in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, AirBridgeCargo clearly realises its responsibility to its customers in terms of delivering a quality product to the end user- a patient."</p>

      <p>QANTAS Freight announced that it would work with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the local airfreight industry to lead the rollout of its e-Freight initiative in Australia by 2010. Executive general manager Qantas Freight Enterprises, Grant Fenn, said IATA's e-Freight initiative was an important step towards simplifying and modernising the air cargo industry to meet the demands of today's global supply chain. "Airfreight at present is unnecessarily complex, relying on myriad outdated paper processes," he said. "We are looking forward to when paper airwaybills and other documentation currently required in multiple copies, can be replaced with a single electronic message that can be used throughout the life of the shipment."</p>
      <p>Fenn said Qantas Freight was well placed to lead the rollout of e-Freight in Australia, having already begun a multi-million dollar project to replace its legacy IT systems to improve the accuracy of data capture and manage demands for greater data sharing. "It is crucial to the success of e-Freight that all players, including airlines, government agencies, forwarders and shippers, work together to improve the quality of information. "Ultimately, electronic messaging will mean better service for customers and a strengthening of the safety and security of air cargo, without disrupting speed of delivery. "The e-Freight initiative will also deliver significant cost savings to the industry through the elimination of paper storage, a reduction in the incidence of delays from freight arriving at its destination without documentation, and improved data consistency."</p>

      <p>Automotive group PSA (including Citroen, Opel, Peugeot and DS) has joined Paris-based CIN FRANCE (cargo information network). This cargo community system manages digitally, air cargo traffic for all French airports for both import and export.</p>
      <p>The PSA group follow in the footsteps of exporters including Schneider Electric and Sanofi - some of the biggest French airfreight customers.</p>
      <p>Launched in January 2016, CIN connects to all Customs applications, and guarantees the administration of export tax (VAT) from France. It tracks all freight traffic from factory to shipper up to the aircraft take off.</p>
      <p>Jean-Francois Bouilhaguet, president of CIN, previously CEO of SODEXI, a subsidiary of air France KLM, is certain that this system is the solution for traceability of general cargo. "Air cargo traffic is clearly more economic than express freight but cannot guarantee the same quality of track and trace. This is mainly due to the number of different players in the chain. Also, the shipper may change his logistics providers according to his business opportunities as well as price. The CCS can handle this flexibility without downgrading the quality of the data."</p>
      <p>Pointing out the benefits of CIN, Bouilhaguet said, "CCS guarantees transparency but above all, gives access to the data which is normally not available such as the details of ULDs loaded by the handler, the exact time that each individual ULD is moved to the apron and the exact moment as it is loaded onto the aircraft."</p>
      <p>He added that CCS has the capacity to supply information on real-time temperatures during transit through the different parts of the airport operation as needed. Amongst the 40 Customs bonded warehouses CCS is the only service available for tracking these items, he said.</p>

      <p>Big-spending logistics solutions group WiseTech Global has made another acquisition, this time the purchase of Trinium Technologies, a provider of intermodal trucking management systems (TMS) in the US and Canada. Headquartered in Los Angeles, Trinium offers TMS for the movement of seafreight containers between port terminals, inland rail terminals, container yards and warehouses. It supplies more than 185 trucking customers including Horizon Freight System, NFI Industries, California Cartage Companies, ContainerPort Group, Schneider Logistics Transportation, and The Pasha Group. Rapidly expanding WiseTech last week bought Taric, a customs management solutions provider headquartered in Madrid, Spain. In June, WiseTech announced its third acquisition in less than two months by purchasing parcel TMS provider Pierbridge.  It the same month it swooped on Fenix Data Systems, a customs management solutions provider in Canada, and Turkey-based Ulukom, which offers a range of logistics, customs, freight forwarding and warehouse support software. WiseTech Global chief executive Richard White said: "Trinium enables specialised road transport for the first and last mile container movement required on every international shipment, which is a highly specialised transport process distinct from general road freight. "With its valuable experience in containerised road transport, extensive port connections, well-regarded leadership team, and highly scalable, asset-based enterprise solution, Trinium is an important further addition to our cargo chain ecosystem. "Together we will leverage our global reach and powerful development capacity to scale up our broader TMS offering globally, building out the eco-system further, and providing ever more productive and integrated solutions to customers across the supply chain." Remaining under the leadership of its existing management team, Trinium will have access to the 7,000 logistics providers across the world who utilise WiseTech's integrated supply chain execution solutions including its flagship, CargoWise One.

      <p>Brussels airport has launched its pharmaceutical certification process to assess the BRUcargo air freight community against the checklist of sector standards developed by IATA. The European hub aims to become the world's first certificated community in IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Handling programme (CEIV Pharma), serving as a pilot project. At the beginning of this year, Brussels Airport invited the BRUcargo community to join the effort to "upgrade, align and standardise the pharma handling processes" as well as to train industry stakeholders through the entire supply chain on and around the airport. It has now kicked-off the four month evaluation process for the eleven BRUcargo participating companies, aided an an IATA project team. "The wide range and diversity of the participants shows the broad interest of the pharma logistics community based at BRUcargo and the commitment to take the pharma handling to a next level," says Nathan De Valck, Brussels' pharma and life science logistics expert. All the different stakeholders involved in the Belgian airport's cool chain are represented in the pilot group. Airlines: Brussels Airlines Cargo and Finnair Cargo. Handling agents: Aviapartner, Swissport and WFS. Forwarders: AD Handling, BPL, Expeditors, UTi and SDV. Truckers: Jan de Rijk.  Steven Polmans, head of cargo at the airport, says: "Brussels Airport is aiming to strengthen its position as a leading gateway for the handling and transportation of pharmaceutical freight in Europe. "We hope that our leadership in being recognized as a CEIV Pharma certified community will persuade other airports to do the same. It is important that cold-chain pharmaceutical products can be transported in a standardized, sanitary and secure way throughout the world."  Did you find this article of interest, if so why not register for a FREE digital subscription to Air Cargo News? – Find out more Interested in Freighters, if so why not register to attend the Freighter &amp; Belly Cargo World Conference ? – Find out more</p>

      <p>The Customs Export Application to serve BRUcargo forwarders has gone live to help improve data sharing and efficiency among the cargo community at Brussels Airport.</p>
      <p>Forwarders who use the app, which went live on 1 July, can improve efficiency by avoiding having to wait in lines at the Customs offices to stamp AWBs, avoiding having to create Excel list reports and having to collect alternative evidence manually, eliminating paper based procedures and the resulting errors.</p>
      <p>The Customs authorities give clearance priority to forwarders' shipments handled via the Customs Export App, which is one of the many apps made possible by the BRUcloud, the open community platform based on Nallian's data-sharing technology and initiated by the cargo department of Brussels Airport Company.</p>
      <p>The app combines manifest data, which has been made available in the BRUcloud since 2016, with newly added data from the forwarders, and the app matches the collected data at AWB level and reports a complete set of information automatically to customs.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport Company head of cargo and logistics, Steven Polmans says: "It is the first result whereby information from different sources can be linked to one new solution, without much effort, but with great impact on the day-to-day operation of the companies participating. This is one of the several benefits we aimed for when developing our community platform."</p>
      <p>Six companies are already using the app on a daily basis, with another 25 confirming they will roll it out in the coming weeks, covering 90 per cent of the volumes handled at BRUcargo.</p>
      <p>Federal Public Service of Finance, Customs and Excise Duties advisory general, Bart Vleugels says: "This collaboratively created app results in a lower administrative burden for all the parties. Digitisation within BRUcargo will further lower the chances of errors and will help to drastically decrease lead times."</p>
      <p>The BRUcargo slot application will be introduced later this year, reducing waiting times at the handlers' premises, and Sara Van Gelder, who is leading the BRUcloud project says: "The application is undergoing final testing with the partners in our project group and the results are meeting our expectations. We are excited and look forward going live with additional partners in the last quarter of this year."</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport handles 650,000 tonnes of freight annually, with almost 500,000 tonnes flown.</p>

      <p>Logistics provider Kenco has opened a new 300,000-square-foot distribution center in Kalamazoo, Mich., that meets standards for handling medical products. The new facility, which includes 17 loading docks and 120 truck-trailer parking spots, will replace another nearby facility that the company has since outgrown.</p>
      <p>"Increased shipping volumes and strong customer demand for services prompted us to build the expanded distribution center," said Paula Hise, Kenco's group vice president for health and personal care.</p>
      <p>Currently there are 100 employees at the facility with plans to add 10 more permanent jobs in the next two years. Goods that are manufactured in the upper Midwest will be shipped from the facility to both North America and international destinations.</p>
      <p>Kenco will provide a full range of distribution services from the facility, including order fulfillment, reverse logistics, raw materials management and transportation. Kenco has more than 90 warehouses across the U.S. and Canada.</p>

      <p>Bollore Logistics Singapore is to invest 10 million Singapore dollars ($7.2 million) in its first automation facility featuring a 12,000 tote multi-shuttle system.</p>
      <p>The 20,000 square metre facility featuring a 12,000 tote multi-shuttle system from Dematic to increase space efficiency and improve throughput by up to 10 times compared to conventional warehouse methods is supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board and is in partnership with French luxury products group LVMH.</p>
      <p>Bollore Logistics Asia Pacific chief executive officer, Cyril Dumon says automation is key for logistics to cope with emerging patterns, saying: "The setup will be housed in Bolloré Logistics Green Hub, our high-tech logistic facility in Pioneer Turn, and we are happy to announce that the co-development of this automation has secured a long term commitment from LVMH."</p>
      <p>The combination of multi-shuttle system and picking technology is the first of its kind to be deployed in Singapore, and Bollore says the facility will bring significant transformation to tackle supply chain operations – from order preparation, inbound to final dispatch of orders, to integrating control checks that ensure greater accuracy.</p>
      <p>The facility will allow for higher storage density to make efficient use of limited warehouse space in Singapore, and will improve throughput up to 10 times and improve order lead time while using half the existing manpower resources.</p>
      <p>Bollore Logistics Singapore supervisor, Tan Kok Xiong says: "The ground staff is looking forward to this automation facility. Early communication is already in place to assist the staff so they are prepared for what's coming."</p>
      <p>"Although staff skills need to be upgraded through training, they can use this chance to expand their skillset and integrate flexibility to increase productivity."</p>
      <p>Bollore says the facility should be completed in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Bollore Logistics Australia became an Australian Trusted Trader under the Australian Economic Operator programme on 28 April, with benefits including reduced cargo inspections at the border, improved cargo lead time, duty deferral, streamlined reporting and priority trade services.</p>
      <p>Bollore Logistics Australia national customs manager, Michael Pinnock says: "Being certified an Australian Trusted Trader further supports and facilitates the handling of clients' international supply and expedites the flow of legitimate trade from all sites in Australia."</p>
      <p>The certification covers all five sites – Brisbane, Darwin, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.</p>

      <p>Perfume and cosmetics manufacturer Interparfums has agreed a deal with France-headquartered global supply chain giant Bolloré Logistics that extends their partnership for a further period of three years: covering 2018, 2019 and 2020. Bolloré Logistics has been handling supply chain services for Interparfums since 1994. The logistics partnership started in a 200 sq m warehouse in Petit Quevilly, Upper Normandy. Bolloré then began operating a warehouse of 9,000 sq m in Grand Couronne in 2000 for Interparefums which was subsequently expanded in 2003 to encompass a surface area of 12,000 sq m. As the company continued to grow, so Interparfums took on an additional 9,000 sq m of space at the facility in 2006. In 2011, activity at Grand Couronne was transferred to Criquebeuf sur seine in a 30,000 sq m building rented by Interparfums. And, since then, a construction permit for the creation of an additional 6,000 sq m of space has been granted, with the extension planned for the second quarter of 2018. That will bring the facility's footprint at Criquebeuf sur seine to a total of 36,000 sq m. The Bolloré Logistics facility in Grand Couronne provides upstream transport from the packers located in the Normandy, Centre Val de Loire and Hauts de France regions of the country, as well as logistics services. It takes care of unloading, product reception, storage and stock management, ordering and order preparation for France and global destinations by both sea and air. It also handles transport planning, documentation management and returns by means of various to interfacing systems and electronic data interchange (EDI) with Interparfums. Bolloré Logistics global sales director Olivier Boccara observed of the deal extension: "Interparfums is a historical customer who trusts us." Interparfums deputy managing director Philippe Santi added: "Bolloré Logistics has been a key partner in our development for many years. "Their expertise in the perfumes and cosmetics sector, the quality of their processes and the professionalism of their local teams are for us key factors of success and allow us to offer a powerful service to all our customers worldwide." Interparfums has global exclusive licensing agreements with luxury, fashion and accessory brands such as Montblanc, Jimmy Choo, Coach, Boucheron and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, and also owns Lanvin and Maison Rochas (fashion and perfumes).

      <p>Intensifying its ties to the global startup scene, Lufthansa Cargo recently made significant investment Portland-based tech startup, Fleet Logistics.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the strong collaboration between Lufthansa Cargo and Fleet Logistics is expected to link extensive airfreight experience with a technology-driven, fresh view on global logistics processes.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2014, Fleet Logistics is an online marketplace, matching customers' demand for freight services with free capacity provided by various logistics companies. It addresses customers' inherent desire for convenience in complex cross-border freight shipping processes.</p>
      <p>"Fleet Logistics is a perfect match for us as it combines innovative and visionary thinking with a strong intrinsic motivation to improve air cargo booking and shipping efficiency, and our customers' overall experience," said Peter Gerber, CEO of Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>"We expect substantial learnings with regards to our product and service portfolio. Hence, we are sure that Lufthansa Cargo and Fleet Logistics will mutually benefit from sharing concepts and ideas." Said Gerber.</p>
      <p>Fleet Logistics is also planning to expand its board of directors with the new seat held by Lufthansa Cargo's CCO Alexis von Hoensbroech.</p>
      <p>Recently, a large number of startups have been pushed into the logistics industry upgrading connectivity between various players of global air cargo supply chains. Consequently, traditional logistics companies have now become aware of opportunities they can capitalise by investing into new digital business models.</p>
      <p>By acquiring shares in Fleet Logistics, Lufthansa Cargo has underlined its strategic commitment in lifting the airfreight industry to a superior digital maturity level.</p>
      <p>The acquisition is part of the Lufthansa Group's overall digitisation strategy, which was strongly supported by the Lufthansa Innovation Hub located in Berlin.</p>

      <p>Brussels Airport launched its Airside Pharma Transporter at The International Air Cargo Association's (TIACA) Air Cargo Forum yesterday, which has been developed to solve issues airside in the movement of pharmaceutical cargo.</p>
      <p>The gateway and its cargo community collaborated to develop the dolly, including DHL, Expeditors, Panalpina, K+N, Brussels Airlines Cargo, Jan de Rijk Logistics, Expeditors and others, while pharma shippers were also part of the development.</p>
      <p>Brussels has acquired four dollies that can be rented by operators at the airport through a booking system. The concept is owned by SPS. The airport envisages a need to acquire more dollies due to the interest shown.</p>
      <p>The transporter is a trailer on which a refrigerated unit with insulated walls is mounted and a major innovation is that the technology allows the temperature and location of the refrigerated transporter to be monitored in real-time.</p>
      <p>The dolly operates with solar panels so the refrigerated unit can adopt or retain the required temperature at any time. It can be used for 36 hours in the summer and 24 hours in the winter. The transporter is for lower deck usage and the temperature of the dolly can be set for between +5 to +25 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport first introduced the Airside Pharma Transporter last year for the pharma sector in Belgium, but it has been renewed and the innovations have been made to meet challenging requirements, especially for areas of extreme weather. The transporter is not only energy neutral, but also more efficient and a larger number of transports per day is possible.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the launch in Paris, Brussels Airlines Cargo vice president of global cargo, Alban Francois says the transporter is the "missing link" in the supply chain and it he hopes the carrier can use the dolly not only in Brussels but also across the globe to meet needs and demands.</p>
      <p>His views over the dolly being the "missing link" were echoed by chiefs from freight forwarder Expeditors who say they can now extend their relationships on pharma cargo from Brussels Airport, such as to the US with American Airlines Cargo.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport Company chief executive officer, Arnaud Feist says: "The pharmaceutical branch is one of the most important sectors in our country and has a large added value for our economy. It is therefore essential that we offer the required customised service when they export their products.</p>
      <p>"We innovated earlier with IATA by developing the CEIV guarantee certificate for the cold chain; our airport was also the first to achieve this worldwide standard.</p>
      <p>"With the new 'Airside Pharma Transporter' we have developed an efficient product that, thanks to the solar panels, is also extremely environmentally friendly."</p>

    <title>CrimsonLogic launches plug-and-play blockchain solution OTB</title>

    <content>
      <p>Singapore-based CrimsonLogic has beefed-up its multi-country customs platform with the plug-and-play blockchain solution Open Trade Blockchain (OTB).</p>
      <p>OTB is a permissioned blockchain service designed to boost global trade transparency by enhancing the security of trade documents shared between shippers and forwarders.</p>
      <p>Last year the eGovernment specialist launched Global eTrade Services (GeTS), a trade compliance portal for managing and submitting customs declarations across multiple jurisdictions on a single cloud-based platform.</p>
      <p>GeTS chief executive Chong Kok Keong told The Loadstar OTB would add to GeTS services by providing "added value-propositions of immutability and authenticity."</p>
      <p>He added: "These [GeTS] services register the generated trade documents automatically onto OTB where businesses can readily verify their authenticity.</p>
      <p>"This promotes document sharing among businesses and helps build trust. Data registered on OTB can also be reused as the source to generate other related trade documents, further enhancing the accuracy of these documents."</p>
      <p>CrimsonLogic claims OTB is the region's first cross-border blockchain platform aligned with China's Belt &amp; Road Initiative and the Southern Transport Corridor.</p>
      <p>"OTB is a permissioned blockchain network run by trusted nodes, hosted by whitelisted accredited trade compliance companies," it said.</p>
      <p>These 'nodes' – blockchain-speak for important network members or validators – include strategic partners China-ASEAN Information Harbor, Suzhou Cross-Ecommerce, Commodities Intelligence Centre, Korea Trade Network and PT-EDI Indonesia.</p>
      <p>"The geolocation of existing and upcoming nodes provides an extensive blockchain network across Asia. With OTB linking China to rest of the region, it will provide a strategic edge to businesses wanting to participate in China's BRI initiatives as it offers greater connectivity with country's 'Digital Silk Road'," CrimsonLogic said.</p>
      <p>So far GeTS has completed 13.5 million transactions for 175,000 parties across 24 customs areas worldwide. North America represents the bulk of transactions and users, but Mr Chong noted the platform was seeing tremendous growth in Asia, especially in ASEAN.</p>
      <p>OTB went live five weeks ago, with more than 4,400 users and 150,000 documents registered to date. According to Mr Chong, its main benefit for freight forwarders is the trusted trade-document exchange.</p>
      <p>"We will soon roll out a new feature, Document Pouch, which allows related trade documents to be bundled together and logically linked with the latest updates. Asset management capabilities will also be developed to enable asset creation and transfer to support eBL [electronic bill of lading] use-cases.</p>
      <p>"In addition, we will be on-boarding partner nodes from the wider trade communities from more countries to have more diverse representation of trusted nodes on OTB," he said.</p>
      <p>While there are many emerging blockchain services aimed at logistics, Mr Chong said there was currently no "clear winner who can create the tipping point for mass adoption".</p>
      <p>He added: "Most of these pilots revolve around specific use-cases with selected participants. OTB focuses on creating a network effect with an open architecture and easy-to-use layer – hence, it is easy for companies to plug in and start using the blockchain capabilities.</p>
      <p>"It also provides fundamental building blocks for companies to develop and co-create new services and access to a critical mass of prospective participants to facilitate pervasive adoption.</p>
      <p>"It can complement with other blockchain platforms, and in fact we are already working with our partners who are on other blockchain platforms to explore cross-chain applications," said Mr Chong.</p>

      <p>United Airlines Cargo flew its first temperature-controlled shipment using the RKN e1 container this month, on a service connecting Tel Aviv with New York's Newark airport.</p>
      <p>Envirotainer's nickel-metal hydride battery-powered box was approved for US use by the Federal Aviation Administration in July.</p>
      <p>The e1 can be recharged using standard AC power and gives shippers of delicate products "more confidence" than using alternative equipment relying on dry ice or specialist charging equipment, according to Mary Tussing, manager of specialty sales at United Cargo.</p>
      <p>"It will be preferred by many customers," she said.</p>
      <p>United's TempControl service accounts for less than 1% of the carrier's total cargo uplift, but with shipments doubling this year, active refrigeration is becoming an important revenue generator for the carrier.</p>
      <p>Pharmaceuticals are driving this growth as the industry adopts new EU Good Distribution Practice guidelines more widely, but Ms Tussing said shipments of electronic goods from Asia to the US, ice cream and chocolate also demand active cooling. Passive cooling solutions are growing even faster for United, 150% up year on year, as protective packaging suppliers develop more advanced technology.</p>
      <p>In October, the carrier introduced a new temperature-controlled option, branded EZ Passive, that improves response time by eliminating the need for a customised set of processes to be approved.</p>
      <p>"EZ Passive is based on a new SOP [standard operating procedure] which allows customers to book a shipment and transit it the same day," Ms Tussing noted. "It can suit suppliers of compounds or finished chemicals, for food and beverage manufacturers for example, that don't need such a high level of oversight."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, United Cargo introduced a "control tower" to support its TempControl service. A team of 12 based in Houston offers customers end-to-end visibility of the supply chain – a concept that may be more familiar, Ms Tussing accepted, among larger freight forwarders specialising in the pharma market.</p>
      <p>"It's about listening to the voice of the manufacturer, and keeping our eyes and ears on things 24/7," she explained.</p>
      <p>Rival carrier American Airlines Cargo has also been busy in the temperature-controlled arena, rolling out its ExpediteTC° service across its extended network following the merger with US Airways.</p>
      <p>Tom Grubb, manager of cold chain strategy at American, said more than 4,600 employees and ground handlers worldwide received comprehensive temperature-control training during the integration process, to ensure compliance with the sometimes conflicting requirements of GDP, the US FDA, UK Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and individual countries' customs authorities.</p>
      <p>American is set to open a new, multi-temperature pharmaceutical and healthcare handling facility in Philadelphia, serving the strategic north-east US market, by year end. The carrier has also set up dedicated active container management stations at Dallas-Fort Worth, JFK, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Philadelphia, where it can recharge the newly approved RKN units during transit.</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has started construction work on a new Cool Center at its Frankfurt hub.  Sören Stark, board member operations, said during the ground-breaking ceremony: "We've gained a great deal of experience in the worldwide transport of sensitive medications. CEIV certification from IATA has recently highlighted this.  "The excellent collaboration with numerous shippers from the pharmaceutical and chemical industries has prompted demand for our service to grow consistently.  "We're delighted to be able to offer our customers even more capacity and flexibility in our Cool Center as early as late summer." Following completion, as of late summer of this year, 8,000 sq m will be available for cool chain cargo. After the extension, the entire infrastructure of the Lufthansa Cargo Cool Center will be further improved.  It was opened in December 2011 and currently offers 4,500 sq m in four different temperature-controlled chiller rooms as well as a deep-freeze room and direct access to the apron.  As a result, said Lufthansa Cargo, it is currently "the largest hub for temperature-sensitive freight in Europe". In late 2016, airline association IATA awarded the CEIV seal of approval for pharmaceutical transport to Lufthansa Cargo and the Cool Center.  A spokesperson said: "Lufthansa Cargo improves the service continuously, taking into account the needs of the pharmaceutical industry as well as all the prerequisites from the European Union's Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use."</p>

      <p>DHL Express has launched the DHL Medical Express Service (WMX) between Brazil and the US for the pharmaceutical and clinical research sector. DHL said that WMX, piloted in Brazil since November 2018, "addresses increased customer demand for faster and more predictable lead times, given the regulatory complexities that can delay exports". The global logistics giant manages the export and regulatory requirements for urgent shipments with specific temperature needs from several major cities in Brazil to most US destinations in 24 to 48 hours. DHL WMX service points in Brazil have been upgraded and validated to meet several Brazilian federal, state and city regulations around Ministry of Health &amp; Sanitary controls and licensing requirements. Mike Parra, chief executive of DHL Express Americas, said: "The launch of this service in Brazil completes our ambition to offer logistics solutions in the Latin and South American countries where most clinical trials are conducted. "Our strong international network, compliant certifications and combination of responsiveness, reliability and cost-effectiveness will enable this service to be advantageous to all stakeholders in the clinical trial value chain." The successful implementation of the DHL WMX clinical trial platform at DHL Express Brazil included a dedicated customer service center with bilingual staff and an on-boarding team to support investigator sites. The WMX service includes dry ice supplies and temperature-controlled packaging fulfillment, online tools for placing bookings and ordering supplies, and a web-based interface – Express Logistics Platform (ELP) – that connects sites. Brian Bralynski, director of life sciences healthcare Americas, DHL Express, said: "Given the complexity of regulatory requirements in Brazil, our technology solution pre-prepares many of the necessary documents required by investigator sites to complete, while enabling DHL to begin the export and fiscal approval process the day-of- booking to mitigate delays." William Ferreira Rocha, Operations, DHL Express Brazil, said: "We successfully completed our first pickups and delivered them in perfect condition to their destinations. "Investigator feedback regarding the flexibility of DHL in sample shipment preparation, extended pick-up times and overall site experience has been very positive." Qualified customers for the service receive a choice of temperature options (ambient, chilled or frozen) through specialized thermal packaging. Pre-determined contingencies circumvent delays, and DHL quality control centers monitor the 24/7 shipments. The service is capable of transporting laboratory kits and medical devices, biological samples (blood, saliva, urine, tissues, etc), research products, vaccines, drugs for commercial and non-commercial use and medical devices.</p>

      <p>LATAM Cargo will replace its various cargo management systems with one single system, a step it describes as "one of the most important and ambitious projects in our history".</p>
      <p>The airline has selected CROAMIS, a system developed by Indian-based WIPRO as its new cargo management system, which will provide customers with more and better tools, and will also enhance efficiency by standardising processes across different regions and reducing costs thanks to its Software as a Service model.</p>
      <p>Due to the project's magnitude, 45 employees will be dedicated exclusively to its execution, with the support from more than 100 associates.</p>
      <p>LATAM Cargo says that once deployment is complete towards the end of 2020, it will have the industry's most modern and sophisticated system platforms.</p>
      <p>LATAM Cargo chief executive officer, Andres Bianchi says: "Wipro's CROAMIS cargo management solution will not only allow us to satisfy our customers' current needs, but also will enable us to meet future challenges.</p>
      <p>"In addition, deploying this new system will increase our reliability and optimise our cost structure. The CROAMIS platform meets all our requirements to take a big leap forward in our domestic and international markets."</p>
      <p>WIPRO vice president and global head – travel, transportation, hospitality and public sector industries, Deviprasad Rambhatla says: "With CROAMIS, we are bringing about digital transformation usually seen only in the passenger side of the airline industry to the world of air cargo.</p>
      <p>Wipro has assembled a highly talented team of Airline Cargo professionals from across the world, supported by a large pool of technology professionals to build a solid and scalable foundation for the CROAMIS community."</p>
      <p>The company say the new system offer a number of advantages including giving more agility to satisfy the needs of its customers.</p>
      <p>CROAMIS will offer LATAM Cargo's customers a new tracking system, self-service tools such as e-booking, e-claims, e-rates and a system in line with the highest industry standards.</p>
      <p>Replacing various systems will improve reliability and uptime; and will be flexible enough to allow modifications in response to industry needs and allow the incorporation of new technologies.</p>
      <p>Bianchi says: "This end-to-end system will transform our internal operations as well as the way we interact with our customers. Having it places us at the forefront of the global air cargo industry, giving us the opportunity to be more efficient while offering greater autonomy and transparency to our customers."</p>

      <p> Lufthansa Cargo said it had taken a major step forward in ridding itself of its legacy computer systems on 30 June when its IBS iCargo IT solution went live at 120 stations in its network, including the major hubs at Vienna, Munich and Frankfurt. The German carrier claims that the cutover went smoothly, without any major disruption, and sent "a strong signal to the airline industry, traditionally wary of making the switch-over, that migration to new technology solutions can be achieved successfully." The iCargo system will be operated by around 4,500 Lufthansa Cargo users across the world and will support in over 300 destinations in 100 countries. A key component of the Lufthansa Cargo 2020 strategy, it replaces several business IT systems with a single platform integrating all participants in the transport chain. It will support core processes "intelligently" and move information around the business seamlessly. It will also act as a catalyst for future innovations, and will serve the carrier for several more decades. Lufthansa assessed over 400 solution providers in a process that lasted over 18 months before selecting IBS as the partner. Lufthansa Cargo executive board member Dr Karl-Rudolf Rupprecht, said: " The commitment of the IBS team is as extraordinary as the seamless collaboration with the offshore team, both being paramount for the overall project success. iCargo has proven to be the right product regardless of station or hub size and delivered countless value driving functionalities." He predicted that the modernized IT would help the carrier "to efficiently introduce innovation and continuously the best products for our customers." IBS Group executive chairman VK Mathews added that he had been told by senior Lufthansa managers that his company had one of the best system replacement projects ever in the history of Lufthansa Group. Earlier, Lufthansa Group chief executive Carsten Spohr said that the company would extend the €2.5 billion (US$2.78bn) capital expenditure limit beyond 2017 to 2020. </p>

      <p>Cargo handler Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) is investing €10m in a new Pharma Centre at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG).</p>
      <p>Opening in September 2019, it will be the only facility owned by a ground handler dedicated to pharmaceuticals at Paris CDG.</p>
      <p>The Pharma Centre offers both landside and airside acceptance capabilities and will be fully GDP compliant when it opens. It will also become IATA CEIV Pharma certified, as part of an initiative launched by Group ADP within the cargo community at Paris CDG Airport.</p>
      <p>The 2,400 sq m space is "located in the heart of CDG airport's cargo area" and, has its own docks and manoeuvring area for the loading and unloading of temperature-controlled pharmaceutical shipments.</p>
      <p>The facility also includes:</p>
      <p>This investment also includes equipment and supplies for the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>WFS said it is also investing in new digital technology systems to improve operational efficiency and shipment visibility – a new warehouse management system (WMS) supports the use of barcode scanning for real-time storage capacity monitoring and management.</p>
      <p>"This will ensure constant tracking of shipments from the Pharma Centre to and from aircraft with time and date statements available on demand," WFS said. "A temperature monitoring solution with a Cloud platform will collect temperature and humidity data in real-time via sensors and enable this information to be accessed on mobile devices."</p>
      <p>Hugo Rodrigues, vice president cargo France at WFS, said: "Pharmaceuticals continue to be one of the fastest-growing air cargo products and our airline customers have responded to this opportunity with dedicated products and services to meet this demand.</p>
      <p>"WFS also has a vital role to play in helping our customers deliver the quality of service they have promised and in ensuring we consistently perform to the high standards required for sensitive, temperature-controlled cargoes to protect their integrity throughout the cool chain.</p>
      <p>"At a major air cargo gateway like Paris CDG, we believe it is incumbent on ground handlers to invest in the right equipment to handle pharma products. Once again, this demonstrates WFS' willingness to invest in new, state-of-the-art facilities when we see opportunities to benefit our customers and our own business."</p>

      <p>AirBridgeCargo (ABC) Airlines has transported its 500th aircraft engine in 2018, with numbers growing 50 per cent year-on-year helped by the strength of its abcXL product.</p>
      <p>The abcXL product is underpinned by the shipment management and monitoring solution offered by ABC's Control Tower, with transportation of special cargo being monitored and coordinated by its Control Tower, a team of personnel working 24/7 to guarantee seamless deliveries.</p>
      <p>Monitoring includes all important shipment records, the technical condition of the aircraft, temperature settings and changes, shock sensing data and weather forecasting among other things.</p>
      <p>ABC global director of heavy and outsized cargo, Vasily Zhukov says the 500th engine is a milestone serving as a "quantum leap" in the development of abcXL.</p>
      <p>He says the airline has realigned procedures, working with partners, trained personnel and introduced 3D modelling software tools to enhance load planning and minimise the time required for ground handling procedures.</p>
      <p>Zhukov says: "This 500th transportation in only eight months of the current year proves once again that our customers recognise the value provided by AirBridgeCargo Airlines, trust our global abcXL team of experts, and appreciate our dedication to meeting every requirement."</p>

      <p>The Customs Export Application went live to serve the BRUcargo forwarders community on July 1. This application is one of the many apps made possible by the BRUcloud, the open community platform based on Nallian's data-sharing technology and initiated by the cargo department of Brussels Airport Company about three years ago.</p>
      <p>BRUcargo is the dedicated cargo area of Brussels Airport which handles 650,000 tonnes of freight annually, almost 500,000 tonnes flown.</p>
      <p>The app combines manifest data, which has been made available in the BRUcloud since 2016, with newly added data from the forwarders. The app matches the collected data at AWB level and reports a complete set of information (which could not be reported by the forwarder himself) automatically to customs. "It is the first result whereby information from different sources can be linked to one new solution, without much effort, but with great impact on the day-to-day operation of the companies participating," says Steven Polmans, head of Cargo and Logistics at Brussels Airport Company. "This is one of the several benefits we aimed for when developing our community platform," he adds.</p>
      <p>Forwarders who opt to connect to the Customs Export App can drastically improve their efficiency by avoiding having to wait in lines at the Customs offices for the stamping of AWBs, avoiding having to create Excel list reports and having to collect alternative evidence manually, thus eliminating paper-based procedures and the resulting errors. Moreover, the Customs authorities give clearance priority to forwarders' shipments handled via the Customs Export App.</p>
      <p>Before this procedure it could sometimes take a long time before documents were verified, as this had to be done manually. This resulted in a lot of work and had a negative impact on customer satisfaction.</p>
      <p>The initiative to develop this quick-win app came from the Customs working group, one of the working groups of Air Cargo Belgium (ACB), the air cargo community representation which strives to make BRUcargo the most attractive, efficient, innovative and successful logistical platform. "This app is a win win for both the Customs authorities and the forwarders. "A fine example of the fruitful cooperation between the stakeholders at BRUcargo," says BDP International NV, one of the 6 companies already using the app on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>"It was great to see the collaborative approach in the community resulted in an application that addressed the urgent needs of the entire forwarding community. Together with the other members of BAFI, DHL Global Forwarding was happy to provide support in developing it," adds David Bellon, director Airfreight of DHL Global Forwarding Belgium. And more are following… over 25 companies have already confirmed that they will roll out the app in the coming weeks, covering 90 percent of the volumes handled at BRUcargo.</p>
      <p>"This collaboratively created app results in a lower administrative burden for all the parties. Digitisation within BRUcargo will further lower the chances of errors and will help to drastically decrease lead times," says Bart Vleugels, Advisory General at Federal Public Service of Finance, Customs and Excise Duties.</p>
      <p>Later this year, the BRUcargo slot application will be introduced, reducing waiting times at the handlers' premises. "The application is undergoing final testing with the partners in our project group and the results are meeting our expectations," says Sara Van Gelder, leading the BRUcloud project at BRUcargo. "We are excited and look forward going live with additional partners in the last quarter of this year."</p>

      <p>Turhan Özen, chief cargo officer of Turkish Airlines and the head of the Turkish Cargo, has been elected to the Board of The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA).</p>
      <p>Özen has an extensive knowledge of the territories surrounding Turkey, having overseen business development in the Balkans, Middle East, and African regions.</p>
      <p>"With a sizeable and impressive new airport, Turkey is set to become a major aviation transport hub between Europe and Asia," said Sebastiaan Scholte, chairman of TIACA and chief executive of Jan de Rijk Logistics.</p>
      <p>"Because Turhan will be present on the ground as this major project works towards completion, his insight will prove invaluable to the TIACA Board and its members."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month Turkish Airlines moved all operations from Ataturk Airport to the new Istanbul Airport, an undertaking called the "Great Move" by the airline.</p>
      <p>The new airport, due for completion in 2027, will eventually offer six runways boosting capacity for cargo.</p>
      <p>"The air cargo industry requires effective leadership to manage the changes demanded by continuously diversified customer needs," said Özen.</p>
      <p>"That leadership needs to be the clear manifestation of the common will to enable us to establish well-functioning processes and a sustainable future vision.</p>
      <p>"I believe that my Board membership at TIACA will contribute to this  leadership in terms of  a  positive way  for the change and for the development of the international air cargo sector."</p>
      <p>Özen is one of several new members recruited to join the TIACA board as part of an ongoing strategy launched in 2018 to focus more on members and content.</p>

      <p>Air France-KLM Martinair Cargo (AF-KLMP Cargo) has introduced its What Counts product for small and medium-sized customers, bundling together 24/7 easy-to-connect services, tailor-made offers, and a loyalty programme. The Franco-Dutch carrier said that implementation of What Counts is "a substantial enhancement of our service through the utilisation of big data, digital and customer relationship management (CRM), while still maintaining our human touch". The European airline is rolling out What Counts after "extensive research revealed that we have a good understanding of the specific needs of this diverse group of customers," added a spokesperson. Gertjan Roelands, vice president cargo Europe, said: "We are able to approach every customer in a unique way, based on their particular needs, by sending them specific offers and information appropriate to their level of specialisation. "Big data and a sophisticated CRM strategy make it possible for us to adopt this approach." What Counts offers customers myCargo, a digital portal to make and manage their bookings themselves, 24/7. It contains a range of services, such as Quote &amp; Book, Notify Me, Track &amp; Trace and Claims. Added the spokesperson: "We are developing myCargo in an agile way. Based on customer needs, we are introducing enhancements to existing services and completely new services every three months. "Alongside these e-services, we have also created dedicated customer service &amp; sales desks in our market organisation, so that we can further specialise in the specific needs of our SME customers and interact with them more effectively." AF-KLMP Cargo will reward customers' loyalty with blue credits for cargo bookings, in the same way it does passengers through the BlueBiz programme. "So, our customers can now receive blue credits for both their cargo and passenger flights when they book Air France and KLM. These blue credits can be spent on airline tickets, thereby presenting our customers with a way to further reduce their travel costs. Since the beginning of this year, AF-KLMP Cargo has implemented and developed the What Counts programme in the Netherlands. Added Roelands: "We have seen our market share and customer satisfaction growing in this specific customer segment in the Netherlands. At the moment, we are gradually introducing this new scheme in Germany, the UK, and Italy. The rest of Europe will follow in the first half of 2018." Read more cargo Airline news</p>

      <p>Airfreight and express wholesaler AMI UK has seen a 10% rise in traffic during the first three months of its trade-only online service, Click2ship Express Imports. AMI said that the recently-launched service aims to make handling imports "less labour-intensive and more profitable for couriers and freight agents," by enabling customers to obtain an online quote for any express import shipment. It added that the "easy-to-use all inclusive pricing tool" includes freight charges, collection at origin, delivery at destination and all Customs processing. The new service takes the place of telephone enquiries. A click2ship Express Imports quote is converted to a booking; the system then generates all paperwork, which AMI's agent customer can forward to his customer and their overseas supplier. Regular updates, notifications and tracking information are all available online and, if the collection and delivery points are confirmed prior to booking, an accurate transit time can also be confirmed. While intended to provide an all-inclusive service, agents can still opt to perform some functions (such as Customs clearance) themselves. AMI's vice president Europe, Sharon Wright, said: "I can only see click2ship Express Imports growing, as more and more customers become aware of its benefits to their businesses. "In addition to getting fast quotes, they will now be able to improve collection and transit times, with goods often being picked up at origin on the same day the booking is made; this was not possible with the previous manual system." Click2ship Express Imports is aimed primarily at smaller and lighter shipments, but can also be used for larger consignments. The only commodities click2ship Express Imports cannot accept are Lithium Batteries and other Dangerous Goods. If an attempt is made to book such cargo, the enquiry is automatically forwarded to AMI's Cargo Import desk for alternative carriage options. AMI's new imports service is global, and means that the company now transacts over 40% of its global business through its web portals. Concluded Wright: "A lot of couriers and freight agents have previously shied away from express imports, thinking they were complex, fraught with restrictions, and suffered lack of visibility and control. "We believe click2ship Express Imports fully addresses these problems, and will encourage these customers to take a fresh look at this potentially lucrative revenue stream."

    <title>American Airlines Cargo's digital drive gathers momentum with iCargo roll out</title>

    <content>
      <p>American Airlines Cargo (AA Cargo) began rolling out a new end-to-end cargo management system on October 1.</p>
      <p>Powered by the iCargo platform and implemented in partnership with IBS Software, the new tool will replace most of AA Cargo's legacy technology, reducing the number of systems from 90 to ten. It will enable more efficient online channels, better tracking and greater efficiency in warehouses, AA Cargo said.</p>
      <p>This step is part of a broader initiative to upgrade and modernise the business; further developments are expected to occur over the next 12 months.</p>
      <p>Jessica Tyler, vice president strategy and development for AA Cargo, said: "As our team continues to evolve through digital enhancements and investments in technology, we want to lead the effort to challenge and change the way players in the industry interact and collaborate – that's exciting work to be a part of."</p>
      <p>Tyler told Air Cargo News that the project had been almost three years in the making and involved the roll out of the system at 300 locations, with 8,000 people affected.</p>
      <p>She added that the last 30 days had seen some challenges as the company and customers adapt to the new system.</p>
      <p>"[The roll out] has been an incredible amount of work for everyone, but it has far exceeded our expectations," Tyler said.</p>
      <p>"However, we aren't yet celebrating. We are still working hard to adapt to new processes and to the new systems and to say it went perfectly wouldn't be true, but it has gone well overall.</p>
      <p>"There are challenges that we are working through with our team, with our customers, and that is where we are focussed right now – making sure we are adapting, where we need to, to the new processes and the new system."</p>
      <p>Tyler said that over the last year the front-line team had been carrying out a "ton" of testing of the system to make sure it was ready for implementation.</p>
      <p>"We did our best, but no matter how well that goes, and we learnt a lot during the testing cycle, there is nothing like getting 8,000 people on a system and then the realities of our business.</p>
      <p>"What we are most proud of is the team," Tyler added. "Our team was so ready for this – we had an award-winning team that was working on 40-year-old technology.</p>
      <p>"In this last month, the team has focussed on moving to the future and they are excited to put our 40-year-old technology to rest at some point."</p>
      <p>Tyler said that for the time being the new and old systems are running side by side while more modules become operational.</p>
      <p>She said one of the most exciting developments with the new system is that updates and developments can be made more easily.</p>
      <p>Tyler said that previously, developments could be cost prohibitive because they would need to be made across so many different systems.</p>
      <p>"But being able to streamline our technology footprint is just the beginning," she said. "It then becomes a platform for us to launch all kinds of other things that we have had to say no to for a long time."</p>
      <p>The customer feedback has been largely positive, Tyler said: "I have heard mostly great feedback, but we have had issues and have feedback from customers about the pain they have been feeling. However, it is about how we respond to that by communicating with them and supporting them to keep their business moving."</p>
      <p>Philip Scaria, program manager for IBS Software and lead of the modernisation effort, added: "The scale and size of the American Airlines Cargo enterprise challenged us to dig deep into our experience and skills to lead this implementation. The commitment of team members across the globe and their willingness to embrace change has made all the difference."</p>

      <p>AMI UK's trade-only online express service, click2ship Express Imports has boosted traffic by 10 per cent in its first three months, and is speeding up quotes and saving customers hours of research.</p>
      <p>The service aims to make handling imports less labour intensive and more profitable for couriers and freight agents, by enabling customers to obtain an online quote for any express import shipment, with an 'all inclusive' pricing tool including freight charges, collection at origin, delivery at destination and all customs processing.</p>
      <p>It takes the place of telephone enquiries – producing accurate, instant quotes that couriers and agents can use to provide instant prices for their own customers based on prime integrator suppliers.</p>
      <p>Quotes are easily converted into a booking with the system generating all paperwork, which AMI's agent customer can forward to their customer and overseas suppliers, with regular updates, notifications and tracking information available online, and if collection and delivery points are confirmed prior to booking, an accurate transit time can also be confirmed.</p>
      <p>click2ship Express Imports is based closely on click2ship Express Exports, and the import service has now completely replaced the former manual express imports system, and has handled an average of over 20 bookings every day since its launch.</p>
      <p>AMI vice president Europe, Sharon Wright says: "I can only see click2ship Express Imports growing, as more and more customers become aware of its benefits to their businesses."</p>
      <p>"In addition to getting fast quotes, they will now be able to improve collection and transit times, with goods often being picked up at origin on the same day the booking is made; this was not possible with the previous manual system."</p>

      <p>Ground handler dnata has introduced blockchain technology into its cargo operations, in conjunction with Emirates Innovation Lab, IBM and flydubai Cargo. Blockchain technology is seen as a secure, public electronic ledger and peer-to-peer network that can be managed autonomously to exchange information between different parties. Kevin Ennis, vice president commercial and business development for dnata's UAE cargo operations, said: "Dnata has always been at the forefront of innovation, and the success of our study to use blockchain technology in our operations means greater security, efficiency and cost savings to our customers. "We are on the cusp of revolutionising the way we operate, and the success of this initiative with our partners will give the industry a real boost towards seamless service delivery." A company spokesperson said that airfreight's traditionally paper-based processes require multiple sign-offs by inspectors and receivers before goods can be delivered. "Even when the system is electronic, it still requires multiple parties to sign off on cargo shipments, creating a lengthy administrative process. To try and streamline this process, blockchain technology can be used to manage and track the paper trail of cargo containers by digitizing the supply chain." It added: "In such a scenario, what makes blockchain infallible is that, no one party can modify, delete or even edit any one of the blocks without the consensus from others on the network." Flydubai Cargo and dnata, in collaboration with Emirates Innovation Lab and IBM, developed jointly a logistics platform in which blockchain infrastructure was implemented for supply chain transactions from a purchase order from the origin to delivery to the consignee warehouse at its destination. Through PoC (Proof of Concept), flydubai Cargo, Emirates Innovation Lab and dnata were able to identify issues from various perspectives such as technology, security, operation, legal perspectives, and were able to realise new supply chain services including digitalisation of documents. Neetan Chopra, senior vice president-IT strategic services, Emirates Group, said: "Blockchain technology has great potential to exponentially improve efficiency and transparency of business networks, especially in Cargo &amp; Logistic flows. "However neither the technology nor the potential is easy to understand or appreciate. Hence it is imperative to carry out such business experiments and trials so that participants can experience the benefits of breakthrough technologies in a live environment." He added: "The Innovation Lab will now work with our partners and stakeholders to prepare the scale out plan of this innovation to the larger cargo ecosystem." Blockchain technology creates "endless opportunities" for logistics/supply chain applications said dnata, including improvements of transparency and data sharing across the supply chain, better tracking of orders, reducing errors and better fraud detection. Mohamed Hassan, vice president of flydubai Cargo, said: "Blockchain technology is able to transform sectors far beyond financial services. It improves the way we work together in providing reliable and convenient airfreight as it provides end-to-end services."

      <p>Singapore's sea-air connectivity has received a further boost by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Changi airport ground handler SATS and deep sea container port operator PSA.</p>
      <p>A joint statement said that the agreement, facilitated by Enterprise Singapore, will provide cargo owners and logistics service providers with "seamless connectivity for greater supply chain efficiency, and to boost Singapore's status as a key multimodal transport hub".</p>
      <p>PSA and SATS will collaborate on a range of cross-industry initiatives, particularly in the perishables, electronics, and e-commerce.</p>
      <p>'Yard-to-Port' data linkages and network extensions between both companies will enhance track-and-trace capabilities and data transparency that will enable ease of shipment movement within different free-trade zones (FTZs). SATS' services could potentially be extended to new trade routes across both companies' networks.</p>
      <p>SATS was the world's first ground handler to receive European Union (EU) approval as an authorised establishment for meat transhipment services between New Zealand and the EU.</p>
      <p>The joint statement added: "Combining sea and air connectivity services, the partnership between PSA and SATS strengthens Singapore's position as a global transshipment hub for air and sea cargo, paving the way for new business models and supply chain innovation.</p>
      <p>"The freight industry, including small and medium-sized enterprises, also stands to benefit from improved multimodal linkages and transit systems for better supply chain efficiency, optimised transport costs, and faster delivery."</p>
      <p>SATS and PSA will also integrate their systems to aid regulatory compliance and build data analytics capabilities. COSYS+, a cargo terminal handling &amp; management system operated by SATS, will be linked with CALISTA, the global supply chain platform developed by PSA's subsidiary GeTS Asia.</p>
      <p>It will provide real-time updates and greater visibility for shipments transported via multimodal channels. SATS president and chief executive Alex Hungate said: "We hope our cross-industry initiatives with PSA will now enable the whole industry to market efficient multimodal solutions globally, through Singapore."</p>
      <p>PSA International group chief executive Tan Chong Meng, said: "Shippers are increasingly seeking innovative multimodal solutions for their cargo to reach their preferred markets competitively. "This partnership with SATS will enhance Singapore's ability to offer unique air-sea multimodal connectivity to fulfil these demands.</p>
      <p>In addition, through digitally connecting CALISTA and COSYS+, we will be able to offer multimodal users greater visibility of their cargo and better protection of cargo integrity, with optimised transit times and costs."</p>

      <p>Panalpina says it is making headway in its digital transformation with the launch of a system that allows customers to get real-time quotes, book and pay online.</p>
      <p>Currently available on an invite-only basis, My Panalpina will help the 3PL catch up with its rivals, it says.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the company said customers would be able to manage their supply chain end to end, with all partners in one digital place.</p>
      <p>"They can request an instant quote, as well as book and track their shipments in an intuitive, integrated and thus seamless flow," it added.</p>
      <p>"Self-service reporting will complement the experience and, as features are added, the portal will offer interaction capabilities with both Panalpina's customers and its suppliers."</p>
      <p>As well as real-time quotes, the system also provides real-time tracking and full shipment visibility with customers able to access the service through mobile devices.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Stefan Karlen said: "Digitalisation is the number-one trend in logistics and our new customer portal is an industry game-changer.</p>
      <p>"People increasingly expect to quote, buy, sell and deliver online on dedicated platforms, and my priority is that we offer an engaging, seamless digital experience."</p>
      <p>CIO Ralf Morawietz said the real-time quoting and shipment visibility capabilities were at the core of modern customer demands.</p>
      <p>The company said it expected to roll out the platform to its wider customer base in the summer.</p>
      <p>"There is still significant paperwork, coupled with inefficient processes in the industry," Mr Karlen added. "We are one step closer to creating a truly digital end-to-end enterprise, which will enable us to drive down costs, shorten response time and offer multiple communication channels."</p>

      <p>Panalpina has implemented a single warehouse management system (WMS), known as JDA, across 50 of its logistics facilities around the world, representing about half of its warehouses worldwide.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, the 50th site, in Lyon, France, went live with the JDA WMS. Shortly before that, JDA was implemented at two facilities in the United States and Belgium. The global freight forwarder says that Singapore is next in line as the company moves towards full implementation.</p>
      <p>"The speed at which we can implement JDA WMS at an existing or new site, combined with the increasing interconnection of those sites and the powerful functionalities of the system, allow us to efficiently grow our business," said Mike Wilson, global head of logistics and manufacturing at Panalpina.</p>
      <p>Three years ago, Panalpina announced plans to deploy a single WMS across all of its logistics facilities throughout the world.</p>
      <p>JDA uses "scan-and-validate check points" throughout the warehousing process. Panalpina uses the system to track and compare the performance of its warehousing operations around the world, and uses the findings to set benchmarks for inventory accuracy. This model is useful to warehouses handling products that have short life cycles. The system is popular, for example, with fast-fashion customers.</p>
      <p>The management system's reporting and analytics module can be integrated into Panalpina's data analytics services for inventory and demand forecasting. The forwarders explained that "Panalpina uses customer data extracted from JDA WMS to map inventories across product life cycles. Using proprietary algorithms, Panalpina calculates inventory movements to estimate minimum and maximum inventory holding, where to position inventory and what services to offer. That keeps products moving and minimizes working capital requirements in supply chains."</p>

      <p>Swissport Cargo USA, a subsidiary of Swissport International, opened a new warehouse at the Chicago O'Hare Airport. The 138,000-square foot warehouse is designed with a focus on customer needs as well as on safety and efficiency. Moreover, it includes the first automated material handling system in the region.</p>
      <p>On July 20, the facility was opened at a ceremony which was attended by airlines, the local forwarding community, O'Hare Airport and city officials, along with Swissport USA's management team and local employees. With a special focus on safety and efficiency, the 138,000-square foot facility was designed by a team of Swissport Cargo experts to address customer needs and aimed to continue developing Swissport into the best cargo and ground handler in the industry.</p>
      <p>The automated material handling system makes it first of its kind in the region and can accommodate over 120 10-ft units (unit load devices) at a time using pallet platforms and electric ULD movers. All ULDs can be handled to the highest industry standards without touching the floor. The warehouse operates with two cold storages: 2-8 degrees Celsius and 18-25 degrees Celsius. Both have been designed to meet the IATA CEIV requirements. The facility also has 35 truck docks able to handle the peak seasons and features adjacent aircraft parking with in-ground fuelling and power units to reduce overall handling time of the aircraft on the ground. In addition, the material handling system is integrated with the back ramp where ULDs are directly stored into the system or delivered to the customer. These specifications allow Swissport to handle fully-built units from the aircraft to the truck in a considerably short time.</p>
      <p>"This new investment highlights our commitment towards our customers' needs. We raised the bar to become the new operation standard of Swissport Cargo in the US. This is the first of many steps as we are committed to further invest in our people, facilities and equipment." said Dany Nasr, CEO Swissport USA.</p>

      <p>Air Cargo Belgium (ACB), the new air cargo community organisation at Brussels airport, had its official launch this week. The new organisation, whose formation was announced in December last year, groups all companies at BRUcargo, the airport's airfreight cluster, as well as related stakeholders or official organisations. Said BRUCargo: "Traditionally, there have been several organisations active at Brussels Airport, grouping a certain part of the logistical chain such as airlines or forwarders. "These continue to exist but also participate in this new organisation, as they are complementary and serving different needs for the cargo community." Brussels Airport saw 2015 full year freight volumes grow 7.8% to just over 489,000 tonnes, helped by the arrival of four new cargo carriers in the full freighter segment and the development of express services at the Belgian hub. Chairman of ACB will be Steven Polmans, head of cargo at Brussels Airport, who will be helped by two vice chairmen: Alain De Heldt — current chairman of BAFI, the forwarders organisation — and Bas van Goch, who is the current chairman of the Air Cargo Managers Association Belgium (ACMAB), the cargo airlines' organisation.  Said Polmans: "Brussels Airport has participated actively in improving cargo at the airport. Although we facilitate where possible and try to take the lead in several topics, it is the cargo community and the different companies at BRUcargo that make the difference. "Without them, nothing happens. With this new organisation, we can work even closer together in improving our cargo area to the benefit of all. "With the enormous support we have received from the industry in recent months when setting up this new organisation, I feel very comfortable we will succeed together." De Heldt, chairman of Belgian Airfreight Institute, stated: "It is a great to see that, with ACB, we are strengthening our forces in all aspects, respecting the full air cargo community, sharing the same agenda and bringing added value to the market. "I feel confident that we are just at the beginning of a great development where quality and expertise are key. If we strive for 'best in class', cargo-volumes will come automatically." Van Goch said: "ACMAB believes in a strong bond between airport, forwarders, handlers and airlines. Together we can tackle the challenges that we have, for example the electronic air waybill (e-AWB) and ready for carriage delivery. "Geographically, we are in the middle of 'airfreight Europe', with several airports very close to us. If we all come together, with a joint target, we can make sure to keep Belgium as a centre for airfreight, both for on-line and off-line airlines." The ACB mission statement expresses its ambition to "represent the entire air cargo community and make BRUcargo the most attractive, efficient, innovate and successful logistical platform". Several companies have already joined the new organisation and more are expected to come on board "very soon".  ACB will create working groups on topics such as digitisation, operational efficiency and pharmaceuticals.</p>

      <p>The foundation stone laying ceremony for Swissport's new air freight facility at Frankfurt Airport (FRA) was held recently at CargoCity South. Once completed, the new building will expand Swissport's handling capacities by almost 50 per cent. The building is scheduled to be completed and handed over to Swissport in the third quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>The warehouse concept includes a material handling system that allows containers and pallets to be automatically stored in and removed from the warehouse. Swissport will expand its range of special temperature storage and the new cargo centre will be fitted out in accordance with the strict IATA criteria. Once operational, it will be CEIV Pharma-certified.</p>
      <p>The roof of the freight hall will also be home to the first large-scale photovoltaic system at Frankfurt Airport. It will generate 1,550,000 kilowatt hours of electricity yearly – an amount that would power more than 450 four-person households for an entire year. With this move, Fraport is increasing its focus on the use of independently generated renewable energy to cover the electricity requirements of its home-base airport in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Felix Kreutel, senior vice president of real estate and properties at Fraport AG, explained, "Fraport operates Europe's largest cargo hub at Frankfurt Airport. We intend to write another chapter in this success story together with our long-standing customer Swissport. To achieve this, we are continuously optimising our service and product range and offering intelligent infrastructure solutions for our customers."</p>
      <p>The new building at Frankfurt Airport will be Swissport's fourth-largest cargo centre worldwide. Up to 200,000 metric tons of airfreight for airline and shipping customers are expected to be handled here per year.</p>
      <p>Willy Ruf, senior vice president central &amp; eastern Europe at Swissport, said during the foundation stone ceremony, "We are looking forward to offering our customers individual air cargo services at one of Europe's most modern and sustainable airfreight facilities starting in the fall of 2020. Frankfurt Airport thus remains one of the most important airfreight locations in our global Swissport network."</p>
      <p>The airfreight facility has been designed by M&amp;P Architekten, with building company Goldbeck acting as general contractor.</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo has teamed up with the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology to launch a new design of temperature-controlled and energy-efficient air cargo container cool dolly system. The carrier says that the diesel-powered cooling systems on dollies used at many airports and ground-handling operations use too much energy, are expensive to operate and often often have poor performance. The new design, unveiled at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi on 18 January, uses a custom-made power bank that can be attached to solar panels for recharging; the temperature can be properly regulated while minimising power consumption. It also features thermoelectric module technologies and modified compressor units. The new cool dolly is designed for cargoes such as pharmaceuticals, livestock and perishables that need to be transferred between the aircraft and cargo warehouses. It will give Etihad Cargo and the Abu Dhabi International Airport a unique competitive advantage over other airports, the carrier says.</p>
      <p>The carrier plans to extend the system to other Etihad locations. A spokesman added: "Every technology we develop or implement always keeps our extended international network in mind. Though Abu Dhabi is our starting point, other geographies and hubs will definitely benefit from this technology."</p>
      <p>Masdar Institute vice president of research, Dr Steve Griffiths, explained: "Our research platform integrates energy and system engineering in a manner that we believe can make a meaningful contribution in transport and logistics operations in the UAE and overseas." Etihad Cargo vice president, David Kerr, added: "Working with Masdar Institute has helped enormously in developing a specialised temperature controlled dolly that protects sensitive products from the heat and harsh weather conditions we sometimes face here in the UAE." However, the system can also work off the normal power grid in less sunny locations. Around the world. The Etihad spokesman added that the carrier was refining the prototype, and will look at rolling this out across the network once this has been finalised. Etihad Airways could also license the product to other operators, but will prioritise its own partner network.  The research project is led by Masdar Institute Engineering Systems and Management Department assistant professor Dr Sameh El Khatib and professor Dr Mohamed Omar, along with associate professor of electrical power engineering, Dr Vinod Khadkikar. A team of researchers drawn from Masdar Institute students and led by research engineer Anas Fakhri is handling the technical design and testing of the cool dolly while one of Etihad's senior cargo managers, Pablo Brizzio, is working closely with the research team to develop a design that meets the technical requirements and operational constraints. Etihad Cargo Innovation Department is collaborating with Masdar Institute on a number of other related research initiatives including new advanced shock protection material for cargo boxes and testing advanced thermal reduction coatings for Etihad Cargo's Sky Stables equine transportation service. The institute is also working with Etihad airline and Boeing on growing aviation biofuels on a two-hectare farm at Masdar City. It uses desert land irrigated by using seawater and fertilised with organic waste to grow Salicornia plants which produce the fuel. The plan is to later scale up the experiment to 200 hectares and start commercial production. </p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has joined forces with Silicon Valley tech firm RocketSpace to encourage digital innovation in airfreight. It says it is the first freight airline globally to participate in a new Logistics Tech Accelerator which helps start-ups and corporate innovation professionals "bring the future to market." The carrier's vice president product management and innovation, Monika Wiederhold, said: "We are not only fully supporting innovation and digitisation in our own company, we want to drive our industry forward as a whole." While Lufthansa Cargo already offers its customers electronic services of various types, "nonetheless, we see great potential for increased digitisation and services in the entire air cargo supply chain. We are keen to explore new ways together with young, highly-qualified experts from the start-up scene." Global corporations like Lufthansa Cargo working hand-in-hand with "disruptive start-ups" were a prime example of how industry can come together to fuel open innovation, added RocketSpace founder and chief executive, Duncan Logan. He predicted: "The Logistics Tech Accelerator will not only create cross-industry collaboration, but also create a centre of innovation excellence to empower participants to accelerate with purpose and achieve measurable results." Lufthansa Cargo has started an education programme for start-up firms on the air cargo industry's objectives and plans to co-operate with selected companies and incubate ideas for a pilot program. </p>

      <p>LACHS (Liege Airport Cargo Handling Services), one of the leading ground handlers at Liege Airport, has successfully implemented Nallian's Slot Booking for Air Cargo, one of the collaborative applications on the LGG Cargo Cloud. Less than six months after go live, the company has already realized a productivity increase of 33 percent. Other benefits include smoothened peaks and idle times, better usage of manpower, maximized capacity in view of cargo specifics, elimination of waiting time and better customer service.</p>
      <p>Handling almost 200,000 tonnes a year and 150 trucks a day, LACHS saw its operations grow by 50 percent over the past two years. One of the key drivers for using Slot Booking at Liege Airport was ensuring the highest level of customer service while dealing with this rapid growth. "Our main ambition was to improve the quality of our service, not to work faster. Using the Slot Booking application, we managed to do both", says Hossaine El Bouayadi, IT manager and business process development at LACHS.</p>
      <p>Using the Slot Booking app, LACHS makes slots available in the app in view of their capacity, using a wide range of parameters, such as cargo type, type of location, day type etc. The booker requests a slot and the system automatically matches availability and demand or proposes alternatives when needed. Drivers who arrive with a booked slot enjoy priority treatment, both when accessing the cargo zone and at the registration desk.</p>
      <p>"The Slot Booking app helps us to better channel pick-ups and deliveries," says Hossaine El Bouayadi. "We can make sure we have the right staff and equipment available when the drivers arrive, and prepare the goods pro-actively. It also enables us to better coordinate acceptance and warehouse operations, which makes life easier for both our staff and the drivers, and speeds up operations. "Prior to using the Slot Booking app the handling of a truck, including paperwork and warehouse operations, would take on average 3 hours. Today this is done in only two hours."</p>
      <p>Aurélie Dethier, deputy customer service and operations manager at Liege Airport, comments, "We have implemented the LGG Cargo Cloud with the aim to empower all actors at our  to drive efficiency and transparency in their cross-company processes. We are excited about these results and look forward to extending the benefits of the Slot Booking to the other ground handlers active at our airport shortly."</p>
      <p>Jean Verheyen, CEO Nallian said, "Liege Airport was worldwide the fastest growing cargo airport in 2018 and we are thrilled to see our collaborative applications are helping them to drive this growth in their cargo operations. Enabling airports to drive efficiency and transparency by 'working as one' is one of the reasons why we designed Nallian for Air Cargo. It is also why we keep continuously keep on extending our open app ecosystem, together with forward-looking players such as Liege Airport and their cargo community."</p>

      <p>After launching its first technology accelerator project last year, RocketSpace and Kaleido Logistics are returning for a second Logistics Tech Accelerator, set to begin next month in Vigo, Spain. RocketSpace kicked off the next "cohort" of logistics entrepreneurs this week by announcing 10 promising startups that will take part in the accelerator, representing six countries.</p>
      <p>For this Logistics Tech Accelerator, U.S.-based technology co-working firm RocketSpace and Spanish logistics firm Kaleido will be joined by Fiege, Ingram Micro, Lufthansa Cargo and MAN Truck &amp; Bus, which will provide logistics guidance, mentorship and business expertise for the participating startups.</p>
      <p>Unlike early-stage accelerators, the Logistics Tech Accelerator works with funded startups that have a product that is in market or ready to launch, and are not required to give up equity to participate in the program. The accelerator helps these fledgling companies scale their products and services by collaborating with others in the industry.</p>
      <p>"After a fantastic 'Cohort I' experience full of fascinating challenges, we are looking forward to working together with the selected startups to keep on disrupting the industry," said Xoán Martínez, Kaleido's CEO. "Stunning technologies ready to go to market and the incorporation of new corporate collaborators to the program are giving us all the chance to open a new stage of logistics."</p>
      <p>This year's Logistics Tech Accelerator, based on an "open-innovation, pilot-led model," RocketSpace said, will focus on three emerging technology themes: smart warehouse, smart transport and smart commerce and trade. The following startups in these three sectors were selected based on the strength of their teams, their product/service maturity and their corporate partnership potential:</p>
      <p>"There is a global opportunity to revolutionize order fulfillment in warehouses with autonomous robotics and the addressable market continues to grow rapidly," said Cohort 2 participant Tom Galluzzo, CEO at IAM Robotics. "As a startup, speed is critical. This program gives us the access and focus needed to keep accelerating our growth."</p>
      <p>This year, MAN Truck &amp; Bus and Fiege were added to the list of corporate collaborators for the program, joining Lufthansa Cargo, Ingram Micro and Kaleido, which participate in 2016. Executives from other established firms – including Shyp, Peloton Technologies and British Airways – will also serve as program mentors.</p>
      <p>In early February, the chosen startups will begin a four-week curriculum that exploring the key business objectives and roadmaps of the corporate collaborators. In the next phase, the Cohort will schedule one-on-one meetings with corporate collaborators to create individual pilot projects, followed by a product validation stage. The accelerator will conclude with a final public "Demo Day" in May, where participants will unveil a go-to-market solution.</p>
      <p>For more information, please see the Logistics Tech Accelerator website.</p>
      <p>Those interested in learning more about the latest innovations in airfreight technology, can also join us at Cargo Facts Asia in Shanghai, April 25-26.  To register, or for more information, go to CargoFactsAsia.com.</p>

      <p>Deutsche Post DHL Group is investing in local parcel centers to support its e-commerce and international shipping operations. As part of that strategy, DHL Parcel broke ground today on 40,000-square-meter "mega parcel" center in Bochum, Germany, just days after DHL Express opened a shipping facility near Dallas, Texas, on Aug. 15.</p>
      <p>"Our network – with an average of 4.3 million parcels per day – leads the way in Germany when it comes to capacity and quality," said Jürgen Gerdes, board member for the post, e-commerce and parcel division at Deutsche Post DHL Group. "The new parcel sorting center in the heart of the Ruhr region is a very important gateway to one of the largest metropolitan areas in Europe."</p>
      <p>The Bochum center will incorporate energy-efficient technology including LED bulbs and a heat-driven cogeneration (CHP) unit, along with a photovoltaic system to be installed on the roof. Operations at the building are scheduled to begin in 2019, when the facility will process up to 50,000 shipments per hour. Deutsche Post DHL Group expects to spend in the tens of millions of euros on the parcel center, the company said.</p>
      <p>DHL Express' new US$6.2 million facility in Carrollton near Dallas is also designed for energy efficiency and high-tech operations, including electric forklifts and a fully automated sorting system. The 4,600-square-meter facility is DHL's second in the Dallas area and reflects "the growth in shipments from businesses in the vicinity that trade internationally as well as a steady growth in e-commerce among businesses of all sizes," the company said. The Carrollton facility is certified by the Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA).</p>

      <p>AirAsia and SATS's joint venture, Ground Team Red launched its air cargo hub at Kuala Lumpur International Airport's Air Cargo Terminal 1 today (Thursday 12 December).</p>
      <p>Based in Sepang's former low-cost carrier terminal, the facility spans 93,000 square feet and was built at a cost of 23 million ringgit.</p>
      <p>It adds additional storage to the existing 40,000 square foot warehouse, and the combined facilities will handle 300,000 tonnes annually.</p>
      <p>The hub enables GTR to handle both narrow and wide-body aircraft cargo operations and has a motorised material handling system to efficiently handle unit load devices.</p>
      <p>It has a purpose-built 10,000 square foot cold-chain facility for specialised handling of perishables and pharmaceuticals, and dedicated zones for dangerous goods, pets and valuable cargo.</p>
      <p>The opening ceremony was attended by Malaysia's minister of transport, YB Loke Siew Fook, along with Tony Fernandes, CEO of AirAsia Group; Bo Lingam, president (airlines) AirAsia Group; Alex Hungate, president and CEO of SATS; Kevin Chin, CEO of GTR; Riad Asmat, CEO of AirAsia Malaysia; Pete Chareonwongsak, CEO of Teleport.</p>
      <p>Congratulating GTR on their new facility, Fook says: "It is an impressive facility and will help to further elevate KLIA and klia2 as a key logistics gateway, in line with my Ministry's National Logistics Masterplan to develop Malaysia as a logistics hub. I would also like to see GTR replicate this facility, in particular their cold-room capabilities to other airports in Malaysia to add further value to our ambition of developing Malaysia as a logistics hub."</p>
      <p>Chin adds: "We expect KLIA's air cargo to grow steadily. With global e-commerce players investing in the region, the increased capacity and digitalisation will enhance air cargo handling services. We will continue our efforts to strengthen Malaysia's position to become a world class logistics hub in the region by adding capabilities in other parts of Malaysia."</p>

      <p>Virgin Atlantic Cargo and Delta Cargo today launched a new Pharma Zone at their joint facility at London Heathrow Airport.</p>
      <p>This is the first joint venture cargo between the UK and the US, which is the world's biggest trade lane for pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>The Pharma Zone will support the growing volumes of temperature-controlled healthcare and life science products being carried by both and enhances their ability to meet the strict quality and service requirements of pharmaceutical companies and their freight forwarding partners.</p>
      <p>Virgin Atlantic Cargo manager of products and partnerships, Darren Sherlock says: "The opening of the Pharma Zone is the latest enhancement to the pharma products of both airlines.</p>
      <p>"This has also recently seen Delta Cargo become the first US global passenger carrier to gain IATA's CEIV Pharma Logistics certification corporately and at its Atlanta operational hub, while Virgin Atlantic Cargo is on track to achieve Wholesale Distribution Authorisation (WDA) certification in the UK by the end of the year to confirm our GDP compliance.</p>
      <p>"This reflects our joint commitment to delivering the correct level of service required for temperature-controlled pharma products at both origin and destination points across our networks."</p>
      <p>The Pharma Zone features walk-in pods capable of maintaining 2-8°C (COL) and 15-25°C (CRT) temperature ranges for loose pharma shipments. Above the floor of the Pharma Zone for added security is a temperature-controlled storage system for 24 pallets, split into six separate chambers, each of which can be safely maintained within either a 2-8°C or 15-25°C temperature range.</p>
      <p>Other special features include a cargo door dedicated to pharma shipments to speed their flow through the warehouse and reduce the time products spend outside of a temperature controlled environment, and 10 charging points for active cargo containers.</p>
      <p>Delta Cargo vice president, Shawn Cole says: "This dedicated pharma facility at London Heathrow is an important addition to our global pharma network and, most importantly, provides our customers and pharmaceutical manufacturers access to another major international gateway.</p>
      <p>"Delta Cargo has successfully achieved CEIV certification in Atlanta and for Delta's headquarters. Over the next year we aim to add our other key hubs to the network, starting with New York-JFK and Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>"This network, combined with the promise of speed, consistency and efficiency in delivering high-value, time-sensitive, temperature-controlled products right across the network really is a first for the Delta Cargo and Virgin Atlantic Cargo joint venture."</p>
      <p>Virgin Atlantic Cargo managing director, Dominic Kennedy adds: "Our pharma tonnage grew by 20 per cent in the first half of 2017 and we expect this to increase as we continue to invest in, and develop, facilities like our new Pharma Zone as well as GDP processes and training across our network.</p>
      <p>"In terms of our Pharma and Life Sciences offering, we believe our size, alongside direct Virgin oversight at every single station, gives us a real advantage in terms of the agility and flexibility we can offer and our growing volumes indicate our customers share this view."</p>

      <p>Pharmaceutical shippers that will use IAG Cargo's Constant Climate centers for temperature-sensitive cargo can now fly emergency medical shipments under IAG Cargo's Critical product. This new enhancement means that shippers sending urgent pharmaceuticals now have access to the non-off loadable status and performance guarantees offered under Critical.Less than a year since its launch, Critical has already carried over 2000 emergency shipments for businesses across the world. While the range of goods moved has been diverse – from pre-launch consumer electronic devices to formula one tyres to factory down machine parts – all have required the "must fly" status guaranteed by Critical.Following successful trials of Constant Climate Critical across India, the UK and Europe, IAG Cargo is rolling out this new offering across all 109 Constant Climate enabled stations on its network.Alan Dorling, Global head, Pharmaceuticals and Life Sciences, commented, "The development of Constant Climate Critical means that we are now able to build on our offering by providing vital vaccines and emergency lifesaving medicines with a non-off loadable status. In addition to our highest priority grading, the product continues to safeguard temperature-specific shipment requirements, maintaining the purity, potency and stability of the lifesaving medicines that we carry."David Shepherd, commercial director at IAG Cargo, commented, "Critical has been a real success; demand has come from right across our network and week on week we see both new requests and repeat business. We know that there is a real demand for guaranteed capacity and a must-fly service for urgent pharmaceutical products and it is crucial that we continue to innovate to ensure that we meet our customers' needs."It is anticipated that Constant Climate Critical will be popular across key pharmaceutical trade lanes, from manufacturing hubs in India and Europe and into burgeoning pharmaceutical markets such as Latin America. The service offers guaranteed capacity up to the maximum aircraft operating limit, and a dedicated monitoring service through hubs at London Heathrow, Madrid and Dublin.Customers shipping through the carrier's Heathrow and Madrid hubs will also benefit from a dedicated Critical check-in desk, significantly speeding up drop off and collection times.</p>

    <title>Panalpina picks Belgian perishables specialists for takeover</title>

      <p>Logistics giant Panalpina is to acquire the Belgium-based perishables specialists Adelantex and AD Handling. The move follows similar acquisitions by Panalpina in September this year: Cool Chain Group in Germany, and Interfresh Airfreight Handling in the Netherlands. The two Belgian companies are specialised in the handling of perishables imports in Brussels, Liège and Ostend airports. Switzerland-based Panalpina will acquire the companies, subject to conditions, after reaching an agreement on December 18. The companies have agreed not to disclose any financial details of the deal. With a presence in Brussels and Liège, Adelantex handles approximately 75,000 tons of airfreight imports per year, and manages ground handling at Brussels Airport, customs clearance and the onward distribution in Europe. Stefan Karlen, chief executive of Panalpina, said: "This latest acquisition in the perishables arena is another example of how we are building our end-to-end capabilities on the destination side in Europe. "Adelantex' ground handling operations in Brussels are best in class and will serve as a blueprint for similar operations in other countries." Karlen added: "On top of that, Adelantex has a solid customer base and significant import volumes from important origin markets across the world. This will allow us to seize opportunities in those markets to further grow our perishables business." The 46 staff of Adelantex serve around 200 customers across Europe that import fruits, vegetables, flowers, fish and plants into the region. The vast majority of perishables are imported via Brussels Airport where Adelantex operates a warehouse directly on the tarmac with 1,600 sq m of cold storage. A quarter of the overall volumes are imported via Liège Airport and Ostend Airport. Jozef Mergan, chief executive and majority shareholder of Adelantex and AD Handling, said: "As the undisputed market leader in perishables airfreight imports in Belgium, Adelantex will benefit from Panalpina's global footprint and leading position in the perishables market to continue to grow and expand internationally." Adelantex was founded in 1992, originally as a road haulage company, and today is fully-owned by the company's four directors. Once the deal is closed, Kris Poels will join Panalpina as country head of Perishables in Belgium and Luxembourg. Jellen Bosmans and Igor Vandyck will also remain in the company with positions in finance and operations, respectively. Mergan will support Panalpina in further developing its global perishables business. Commented Bruno Jacques, Panalpina's managing director for Belgium and Luxembourg: "Our perishables network is expanding rapidly. After the acquisitions in Kenya, Germany and the Netherlands earlier this year, we are now delighted to welcome new perishables experts in Belgium." The Panalpina Perishables Network currently spans over 20 key countries, with "a clear plan to double the network to cover all regions," said a spokesperson. This latest takeover continues a consolidation trend in the perishables sector by Europe's major logistics players. Kenya's competition watchdog in September this year approved "with conditions" the takeover of two specialist perishables forwarders in the African country by Kuehne+Nagel (K+N) and Panalpina. The Competition Authority of Kenya approved the acquisition of Air Connection by Panalpina Airflo Ltd, Panalpina Airflo BV and Panalpina Kenya Ltd, but ordered the acquirers to retain at least 95% of the employees of Air Connection for at least one year after the transaction's completion date. The Kenyan deal came two years after Panalpina increased its presence in Kenyan flower logistics by acquiring perishables specialist Airflo, Kenya's second largest airfreight forwarder. K+N in July this year announced its proposed acquisition of Kenya's Trillvane, specialised in the export of flowers and vegetables. Read more Perishables Logistics News </p>

      <p>Turkish Cargo says it using its "geographic and network advantage" to make several investments to improve its pharmaceutical services.</p>
      <p>The carrier tells Air Cargo Week (ACW) the transportation of pharma is "highly important both due to humanitarian and commercial reasons".</p>
      <p>The airline explains the yields that moving pharma brings is higher than general cargo and why it is further expanding its pharma capabilities.</p>
      <p>Istanbul, where its main hub is located, is in a prime position to provide rapid connection between the pharmaceutical producers and consumers.</p>
      <p>Turkish Cargo explains to ACW: "We are growing our TempControl business in a variety of ways: expanding our network, offering new product options, making new containers available and enhancing the efficiency of our operational processes and our customer service."</p>
      <p>The Turkish carrier opened a new cargo facility in January 2015 at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, which has an annual tonnage of 1.2 million tonnes and is now handling an increasing amount of pharma through specialist temperature-controlled facilities. The facility covers a total space is 67,000 square metres.</p>
      <p>"We handle temperature sensitive products in temperature controlled areas in our warehouse according to branded Pharma Program and Warehouse Storage Instruction.</p>
      <p>"We provide some special equipments like thermal blankets using with cooler blocks, we can provide ACT containers and accept shipments in containers if shipper or forwarder demands so. In case of delay or any irregularity we provide dry ice supplementation service," the carrier explains.</p>
      <p>Turkish Cargo's services include remote temperature and humidity tracking using smart sensors, ability to report the shipments stored within time range at specific cool storage, temperature and humidity values of cold chain storage areas. Facilities are monitored through an automated system called Telemetry.</p>
      <p>The carrier says it has further improved its handling capability of pharma cargo to make the process transparent, reliable, and temperature-controlled. "We standardised and aligned the pharma handling process. We already have a tracking system on our website and capability of remote temperature and humidity tracking using smart sensors."</p>
      <p>Turkish cargo recently inaugurated a new 3,000 square metre special cargo storage area and now has 39 separate special cargo rooms.  The carrier has signed agreements with temperature controlled container providers and is planning to provide ACT for customers especially for freighter destinations in 2015.</p>
      <p>The airline says it is also planning to launch new products for pharma cargo shipments this year.</p>

      <p>Cool container solutions provider DoKaSch Temperature Solutions GmbH is expanding its fleet of Opticoolers with 50 new RAP-containers. Now 500 active 'Made in Germany' containers are globally available. More units are expected, to push ahead with further expansion.The Opticooler provides reliable transport conditions for shipments across continents and climate zones or during unexpected events, for goods that must be kept within a very strict temperature range. These shipments mainly include pharmaceuticals such as insulin, vaccines and other bio-pharmaceuticals, but also high-tech equipment.Equipped with battery powered cooling compressors and heaters as well as a self-regulating temperature control, the internal temperatures consistently stay well within range at any point in the storage area. Temperatures between 2 - 8°C or 15 - 25°C for example can be maintained, regardless of the ambient temperatures, that may vary between -30°C during a Canadian winter or +50°C during a middle-eastern summer.The flying smart warehouse only needs one electrical outlet to fully charge the energy storage after a flight and to ensure that always enough power is available to deal with unexpected events. A full charge, from 50 to 100 percent, can be achieved approximately within two hours."We are proud, that our products have proven worthy in the day to day air cargo business and that we can offer our customers an extremely reliable product. We therefore provide a solution to tackle the difficulties in the global cool chain logistic" says Andreas Seitz, managing director of DoKaSch Temperature Solutions.Originally the Opticooler was developed for Lufthansa in 2004. Since 2014, the containers are available at many other airlines as well.</p>

      <p>Perishables logistics firm PML has achieved a rating of AA+ under the new BRC Global Standard Issue 8 for Food Safety.</p>
      <p>The Heathrow-headquartered firm said that in order to achieve the standard an in-depth audit was carried out over two days.</p>
      <p>The updated BRC Global Standard for Food Safety takes into consideration new risks and revised legislation and practices intended to improve food safety.</p>
      <p>PML provides a packing service at its Heathrow headquarters, designed to follow the "important protocols associated with packing temperature sensitive goods".</p>
      <p>PML sales director Nick Finbow said: "Customers like to access our in-house packing facility as it represents a route to streamlining the supply chain, reducing road miles and cutting CO2 emissions, allowing their goods to pass directly from our packhouse to a regional distribution centre.</p>
      <p>"By minimising the breaks in the supply chain, both the client and the end user can enjoy significant cost benefits, as well as the assurance that the perishable goods have been handled by experts in the field – fully trained and highly experienced in understanding the sensitivities associated with the packing and transport of perishable products.</p>
      <p>"As per the overall company ethos of investing in technology to ensure the business is future perfect, we are continuing to monitor new developments in the packing sector and our packhouse manager visited Fruit Logistica in Berlin this month, to review the latest equipment and innovations entering the market."</p>

      <p>Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) is now the world's first International Air Transportation Association (IATA) Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Fresh-certified airport. Launch partners in the program include the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK), Cathay Pacific, Cathay Pacific Services Limited (CPSL) and Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl).</p>
      <p>Standards for the IATA CEIV Fresh program are based on the IATA Perishable Cargo Regulations (PCR), and are designed to ensure the safety of perishable food products through standardization of handling and transport operations. The new certification follows IATA's successful push to improve pharmaceutical shipping standards, CEIV-Pharma, and was launched this week at the World Cargo Symposium in Singapore.</p>
      <p>For HKG, the accreditation strengthens its positioning in East Asian cargo markets against regional competitors also preparing to capture emerging perishables trade. The airport has also prepared for increased cargo volumes with plans to expand its runway and construct a new logistics center, which will be serviced by the airport's increased catchment zone and access to multimodal transit due to the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.</p>
      <p>IATA has recognized HKG as a partner airport to CEIV Fresh. AAHK said it expects increasing demand for high-end temperature-controlled products, such as perishables and pharmaceuticals, and believes the airport is well positioned to capture the growth. To support efforts related to this cargo, the airport authority is providing additional cool dollies –a total of 30 – for its airport stakeholders and is building apron shelters to protect perishables from weather elements.</p>
      <p>Hactl has acquired its CEIV Fresh certification following IATA's assessment and validation of its facilities and operations in December 2018 and January 2019, respectively. Hactl key staff underwent training by IATA for CEIV Fresh in October 2018, whereupon the ground handler said it made refinements to its terminal and processes.</p>
      <p>First, Hactl created a fast-track "Fresh Lane" to minimize time required for unloading and transferring perishables to customers or into temperature-controlled storage. Additionally, Hactl is ensuring perishable cargoes' safety by implementing adjustments to four critical control points: the use of thermal dollies to maintain optimum temperatures; the segregation of different perishable commodities through dedicated truck docks; the mapping and visual marking of optimum storage positions in its cool rooms; and the installation of dedicated active ULD charging areas.</p>
      <p>CPSL, which operates Cathay Pacific's cargo terminal at HKG, has also attained CEIV Fresh certification, while its parent company, Cathay Pacific, said it is currently working to become the world's first CEIV-certified airline. Cathay Pacific expects to achieve the certification in May.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the launch of the program at HKG shows the airport and its stakeholders took a community approach to the certification, which could help align the needs and responsibilities of parties involved. Time will tell whether other airports and their stakeholders take the same approach, as standardization of operations and facilities to ensure quality of goods becomes increasingly pertinent.</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo will begin offering spot market capacity through online platform cargo.one as it pushes its digital offering to forwarders. The German cargo carrier has signed a co-operation contract with cargo.one allow customers to book available capacity for its express service td.Flash and its standard service td.Pro "completely digitally and in real time across the entire available route grid". Lufthansa Cargo chairman of the board Peter Gerber said: "Digitisation allows information to be distributed around the globe in fractions of a second. "This has given rise to new expectations with which both carriers and freight forwarders are confronted. We are therefore now offering our customers the opportunity to exchange prices and capacities even faster and to book services even easier. "Booking platforms such as cargo.one will in future support forwarders in meeting their customers' needs even better. This is the next logical step in the digitisation of our industry." Cargo.one founder Oliver Neumann added: "Many solutions on the market promise digital bookability. The reality is that in most cases the rates offered do not give access to capacity. "In particular at times of high demand, our solution offers airfreight forwarders a quick and easy access to capacities with immediate confirmation at live spot rates."

      <p>Until a few years ago, the pharmaceutical cold chain just meant transporting healthcare products in the range of 2-8°C. But with newer products and increasing consumer demands, requirements for different temperature ranges continue to expand. With new solutions undergoing testing and IATA CEIV Pharma accreditation gaining ground across the globe, pharmaceutical manufacturers are positive about achieving their temperature-controlled shipping goals.</p>
      <p>Surya Kannoth</p>
      <p>From shipping pharma products in the 2-8°C range, to shipping them at ''body temperature' (around +37°C), 'controlled ambient temperature' (15-25°C), or at extremely cold temperatures such as -20°C, and in even lower cryogenic temperatures (-80°C and -192°C) – pharma logistics has come a long way.</p>
      <p>An impetus for the latest generation of high-performing packaging products comes as the pharma industry continues to grow at a significant rate with an estimated global worth of $400 billion by 2020, according to the World Heath Organization. What's more, as temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical products are increasingly being shipped globally to more remote regions, there is an even greater demand for innovative solutions being placed on the temperature-control packaging industry.</p>
      <p>"There is an ongoing increasing global demand for temperature controlled packaging solutions, in particular in the high end segment like active/electric containers or passive PCM (phase change material) boxes. This is mainly driven by stronger global regulations and by the fact that almost all new pharmaceuticals are biotech and temperature sensitive. There are more and more PAD (pallet accepting devices) solutions available with a global coverage, and pharmaceutical shippers and their forwarders have today a better choice between the different solutions, according to the individual lane risk assessment," observes Andreas Seitz, managing director, DoKaSch Temperature Solutions, which runs a fleet of the well-recognized active cool containers Opticooler RAP (5 pallet) and RKN (1 pallet).</p>
      <p>"The requirements to become a supplier in this industry are increasing significantly as pharma clients are looking for smart solutions – combining thermal protection but also the data to make faster decisions for product clearance, reducing total cost and CO2 is becoming more and more important," believes Richard Ettl, CEO of temperature-controlled container provider SkyCell.</p>
      <p>Also, the advancement of new drug development includes the increase in more fragile and temperature sensitive pharmaceutical products. As Steve Brabbs, global technology leader for cold chain, Dupont Safety &amp; Construction puts it, "More sophisticated medicines would require more cold chain protection. These large molecular therapies will be stable only if they are stored and transported at a controlled temperature range. So there is a lot of opportunity and there is going to be more opportunity going into the future." DuPont is the manufacturer of Tyvek® Cargo Covers, an innovative pallet blanket for the pharmaceutical industry. Tyvek® Cargo Covers have helped protect the health of millions of patients worldwide by providing proven protection against temperature excursions, rain, dust, pollen, bird droppings, insects and other sources of contamination for pharmaceutical shipments.</p>
      <p>Temperature restrictions when transporting such pharma payloads bring in their own challenges. Apart from this, pharma being shipped to emerging markets, where extreme temperature ranges need to be dealt with, pose another concern. Various pharmaceutical compounds, utilised within the sector, are developed under certain temperature control conditions or designed to be stored at specific temperatures to maintain their stability.</p>
      <p>"With the increased performance of passive containers, it has given pharmaceutical manufacturers a number of more options which is good for the market and for the end consumer. However, biological products with complex tradelanes and high risk profiles still need a very tight and strong engineered product," said Stephen Maietta, head of market development, Envirotainer.</p>
      <p>Now again with the advancement of some of the passives, there is more capacity and more options in packaging for the pharmaceuticals and logistics companies to choose from, observes Maietta. "That's why you see an expanded portfolio of products from some of the airline carriers through to the freight forwarders," he added.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the recent offerings from airlines in collaboration with temperature-sensitive service providers for its pharmaceutical customers:</p>
      <p>Recently, AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) inked a leasing agreement with Sonoco ThermoSafe for the PharmaPort 360 temperature-controlled container. This move is expected to boost ABC's delivery options for temperature-sensitive shipments and guarantee a broader choice of containers available for various pharmaceutical consignments.</p>
      <p>Sonoco's PharmaPort 360 maintains the required temperature in various ambient temperatures from 60C to -40C and can be easily loaded onto standard NAS Series air cargo pallets. Its built-in GPS tracking and GPS Monitoring systems allow for transparent and accurate information to be available in real-time mode.</p>
      <p>This, combined with ABC's Control Tower 24/7, is expected to eliminate the possibility for any deviations from the set point and will give customers extra reassurance of safety and integrity of their shipments.</p>
      <p>"We have been consistently developing and upgrading our 'abc pharma' product, offering our customers dedicated airlift for both passive and active ways of transportation. With PharmaPort 360 being available for lease, we can guarantee another much-needed air freight solution for pharmaceutical goods with precise temperature mode conditions and requirements to maintain an internal environment of 5C. This is a quantum leap for our dedicated product, and we expect it to ramp up our volumes, as well as to gain interest in our services from new customers," stated Fedor Novikov, deputy director, products of AirBridgeCargo Airlines.</p>
      <p>For the first three months of 2019, the abc pharma team managed to achieve a more than 15 percent upsurge of volumes for temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical and other medical products.</p>
      <p>Turkish Cargo signed a master rental agreement with DoKaSch Temperature Solutions for lease of the latter's Opticooler containers, designed for the shipment of temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines and other pharmaceuticals by air.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, Germany-headquartered DoKaSch has begun supplying its active temperature-controlled Opticooler to the Turkish freight carrier from February 2019. Fatih Cigal, Turkish Cargo's senior vice president, marketing, remarked, "The Opticooler is one of the natural choices and the master rental agreement confirms that we have all the necessary procedures in place."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, American Airlines Cargo recently approved the latest innovation in temperature-controlled active containers, the CSafe RAP, launched by CSafe Global. This solution works well even in the most extreme ambient conditions (-30C to 54C), with proprietary VIP insulation, an innovative air recirculation technology, and a unique, autonomous temperature management system.</p>
      <p>Jeff Pepperworth, chief executive officer of CSafe Global said in a statement, "We certainly look forward to further partnering with American to serve our joint pharma customers and to continue the expansion of our global reach with this new active temperature management offering."</p>
      <p>Tom Grubb, global head of pharmaceuticals and healthcare for American Airlines Cargo said, "For many years, American and CSafe have worked together to provide high-quality, temperature-controlled Active RKNs to pharmaceutical and healthcare shippers who depend on these containers for safe air transport of their products. American's goal is to ensure ExpediteTC continues to accommodate customer requirements in order to meet future demand for increasingly complex medicines around the world."</p>
      <p>Many of the same leasing options currently available for the proven CSafe RKN are also available for the new CSafe RAP container. CSafe through a statement said that customers can lease the CSafe RAP container directly from CSafe Global, American Airlines, or through one of CSafe's other logistics partners. CSafe Global offers active and passive temperature-controlled packaging solutions for pharmaceutical products.?Lately, Swiss-based manufacturer of temperature-controlled containers SkyCell and French airline group Air France KLM Martinair Cargo announced a global collaboration to work more closely together on existing and future business in logistics of pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>"With a shared vision of innovation in the supply chain of temperature-sensitive products, our collaboration will ensure that consumers are guaranteed a safe and sustainable service. We will also further improve our services through SkyCell's data-driven approach," said SkyCell's Richard Ettl. Air France KLM Martinair Cargo recently utilized two SkyCell containers, one SkyCell 1500c and one SkyCell 2500c, set at a temperature of 5 Celsius, to transport temperature-sensitive vaccines. "Twelve of the twenty largest pharmaceutical manufacturers globally have independently validated the service offering of SkyCell and implemented its usage into their supply chain," said Ettl.</p>
      <p>Shaping tomorrow's cold chain market with data While newer and improved temperature-sensitive products will continue to remain in focus, the future for the cold chain pharmaceutical market will be data driven, believe industry experts.</p>
      <p>"Good and fast data enables better planning, reducing costs, acting on outside influence (storms, wars etc.). The technology exists – it needs to be implemented on a global scale now. Some pharma companies are further along than others, but all companies we talk to, want our data to help them make better decisions. Today data is an addon – I think tomorrow it will be part of the package," forecasts SkyCell's Ettl.</p>
      <p>DoKaSch's Seitz agrees that the missing link in the pharmaceutical supply chain is the overall shipment data and availability to everybody involved. "Probably, IATA's 'one record' project may help to solve this. This will be a key issue for the air cargo industry at all, but for the cool chain in particular with its very strict process compliance requirement," he said.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of "data sharing" discussion ongoing, but when it comes to the point every stakeholder try to protect his data. Seitz believes "the handling of process irregularities and immediate corrective actions to prevent temperature deviations during shipments" must improve significantly, which also requires data sharing up-to-date shipment monitoring systems.</p>
      <p>He further adds that the demand for either packaging solutions as well as appropriate infrastructure will grow, in particular in markets where there is already an existing pharmaceutical production on a lower level like India, Korea, China and Brasil.</p>
      <p>With the huge range of variables involved – different products, shipping lanes, climatic conditions, storage infrastructures, handling competencies etc. there is no single or perfect solution to the safe shipment of temperature sensitive medicines. But the air cargo industry, with the help of its service providers, is doing all it takes to address risks through a highly synchronised approach, to ensure that the integrity of pharma products is maintained throughout their, often long and punishing, journey to market. And, in the face of ever more complex transportation challenges, the pharma shipper is getting exactly what it needs - choice.</p>

      <p>LATAM Cargo, Latin-America based cargo operator, recently signed a Master Lease Agreement with temperature-controlled packaging solutions provider CSafe Global.</p>
      <p>Based on the agreement, the airline will utilise the company's CSafe RAP and CSafe RKN active temperature-controlled containers that offer unmatched operational capabilities with the industry's longest battery run times and broadest ambient temperature ranges of -30°C to +54°C for the CSafe RAP and -30°C to +49°C for the CSafe RKN.</p>
      <p>The airline has signed the agreement to extend alternative transportation options to its clients shipping temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>"We understand that minimal deviation from the defined temperature ranges can greatly affect the quality of the products and that is why we are constantly evaluating new options for our clients. CSafe containers offer cutting-edge technology that will continue to strengthen our PHARMA ACTIVE Product," explains Rodolfo Marre, Product Development senior manager for LATAM Cargo.</p>
      <p>CSafe's innovative system design combines advanced compressor-driven cooling technologies with superior VIP insulation to regulate payload temperatures precisely where they need to be for up to four US pallets of pharmaceutical product, per container. These active containers have approvals to fly on both the upper and lower decks of aircraft.</p>
      <p>Brad Jennings, vice president of Global Marketing and Partner Alliances with CSafe Global said: "With a comprehensive cargo network serving key markets in the Latin American region, and a robust CEIV pharma programme, we look forward to a very fruitful collaboration with LATAM Cargo as we collectively strive to best serve pharma companies seeking that ultimate peace of mind when transporting invaluable life-enhancing medications to their patients in the important and growing pharma market across Latin America."</p>
      <p>LATAM Cargo's expertise in the transportation of pharmaceuticals has allowed the airline to develop specialized products that handle pharmaceutical shipments. The current offerings are EXP PHARMA PASSIVE, with temperature ranges between 2°C to 25°C and PHARMA ACTIVE with temperature set points from -30C to 30C.</p>
      <p>LATAM Cargo underwent an internal review of its logistics supply chain processes for the transportation of pharmaceutical products to guarantee the preservation of quality and functionality that ultimately culminated in the CEIV PHARMA certification by the IATA in 2017.</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has handled the first dangerous goods shipment with an electronic Dangerous Goods Declaration (eDGD) at Frankfurt Airport using the INFr8 platform.</p>
      <p>The German airline made a significant contribution to the establishment of the global eDGD standard as part of IATA's e-freight initiative.</p>
      <p>A completely new approach was developed and evaluated through close collaboration along the transport chain with the INFr8 platform, with Lufthansa Cargo's IT systems and processes being able to deal with paperless dangerous goods shipments.</p>
      <p>The first shipment was from healthcare company Abbott based in Wiesbaden, and was flown on board flight LH8222 to Mexico City on Thursday 13 September.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo board member for operations and COO, Sören Stark says: "We are pleased that the eDGD has celebrated its global launch with Lufthansa Cargo. This underscores our claim to be the industry pioneer in digitisation. There is still so much more for us to achieve here together with shippers, forwarders and airports."</p>
      <p>The pilot phase of the INFr8 shipping portal has been successfully launched, with all pilot partners being digitally connected to the platform and using it to process transport documents including the Dangerous Goods Declaration.</p>
      <p>Dakosy chief executive officer, Ulrich Wrage says: "Our shipping portal solves a major challenge in the air cargo supply chain, ensuring greater reliability and transparency for all. We are greatly simplifying processes across company boundaries."</p>
      <p>Panalpina was also a key process partner to Dakosy, and Frankfurt Airport plays a major role in dangerous goods handling for both companies.</p>
      <p>Fraport executive director operations, Anke Giesen says: "Thanks to this worldwide innovation, the INFr8 platform integrates the shipper into the electronic information chain of the air cargo process for the first time. We expect this to result in shorter check-in times and much faster handling of dangerous goods."</p>
      <p>The pilot phase of the INFr8 platform, available at www.infr8.de is expected to last six months, after this it will become a standard tool available to all market participants interested in using it.</p>

      <p>The agreement commits to providing customers with a best-in-class booking experience, the cargo.one partnership allows Etihad Cargo to offer an additional avenue for bookings on available cargo capacity to a wider pool of European customers.</p>
      <p>Abdulla Mohamed Shadid, managing director of cargo and logistics services at Etihad Aviation Group says the airline's ambition is to lead the industry into a new digital era, and the cargo.one partnership builds on the airline's own online platform, etihadcargo.com.</p>
      <p>He says: "Our digital investment enabled us to rapidly build the required API connectivity to seamlessly link to the cargo.one platform. Through cargo.one we will offer global capacity to users on new routings and to new destinations across our extensive worldwide network, and provide our own customers with additional booking choice."</p>
      <p>cargo.one serves more than 300 freight forwarders across Europe, with its customer base growing at more than 20% month-on-month.</p>
      <p>Partnering with Etihad Cargo gives European customers access to new markets in the Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, Asia, Africa, Australasia and the US.</p>
      <p>Moritz Claussen, managing director of cargo.one says: "cargo.one is the number one choice for airlines to foster digitalisation and to put their customers first. Our fast-growing user base not only makes it attractive for airlines to join as a means of reaching new customers, but also helps them to serve their customers' needs in the best possible way.

      <p>Ocean platform NxtPort and Air Cargo Belgium have announced a new partnership to investigate the possibility of developing multimodal cargo solutions. The two groups pointed out that companies that transport freight by sea, frequently use airfreight as well, and much of the logistics – such as customs formalities – are the same. NxtPort chief executive Daniel Lievens said: "There are differences between ship and air transport, but increasingly there are more similarities. "Since the Flemish ports and the national airport, Brussels Airport, share the same cargo customers, companies are looking for efficiency and cost savings. "Many of the logistics processes are largely the same, such as customs procedures for goods that must travel the airport and harbors for import and export. If we find ways to make the process more efficient and less time-intensive, everyone wins."  Air Cargo Belgium chairman Steven Polmans added: "If we share our knowledge and expertise through an innovative platform, we create a bridge between the sea and air transport industries. "Our collaboration will strengthen Flanders' position as a regional leader in innovation and logistics. We want to work towards offering more support and a larger market for digital solutions, and involve other links to the logistics chain. "Both NxtPort and Air Cargo Belgium have each held constructive talks with the customs authorities, and I can imagine that the authorities themselves will want to find ways to simplify their own procedures in cooperation with the industry." NxtPort and Air Cargo Belgium signed a Memorandum of Understanding linking to one another's ecosystems. They will continue to develop a digital roadmap, keep the other apprised on processes and procedures, and share use cases. They will hold regular work sessions together to keep the information exchange going. Read more airfreight digitisation news</p>

      <p>Global logistics services provider Kuehne + Nagel (K+N) has said that it continues to prioritise its pharma and healthcare offerings "across all business units and all regions worldwide". To that end, it has confirmed that it is to acquire two specialised pharma logistics companies. In Turkey, K+N has entered into an agreement to acquire Zet Farma, which it describes as "the national market leader in pharma logistics". Established in 1992 and now employing 400 staff, Zet Farma operates 56,000 sq m of space at four pharma grade warehouses in Istanbul. The deal will mark K+N's entry into the rapidly growing Turkish pharma logistics market. Meanwhile, in Italy, K+N has acquired Ferlito Pharma Logistics, a major player in pharma logistics offering GxP-compliant warehousing and forwarding services, including local distribution (GxP relates to the regulations and guidelines applicable to life sciences companies manufacturing medical products such as drugs, medical devices and medical software applications). Gianfranco Sgro, the member of the Management Board of Kuehne + Nagel International AG who is responsible for contract logistics, explained: "The pharma logistics market is expected to significantly grow due to global demographic changes and increased consumer spending. "It is one of the markets (in which) Kuehne + Nagel differentiates itself by operational excellence, global footprint and dedicated logistics infrastructure." The Zet Farma acquisition is subject to approval by relevant Turkish regulatory authorities, and both transactions are subject to customary closing conditions. Earlier this week, K+N revealed that it has invested in 50 temperature-controlled trailers to grow its dedicated road-haul pharma network in Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Virgin Atlantic Cargo has received Wholesale Distribution Authorisation accreditation for its global headquarters operations and its new Pharma Zone at Heathrow Airport, confirming the airline's compliance with Good Distribution Practice (GDP).</p>
      <p>WDA was established by the UK Government's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which is recognised as a trusted and independent source of expertise throughout Europe, working closely with the European regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). The MHRA also collaborates with other international regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
      <p>This achievement follows its handling partner dnata also gaining WDA for its Cargo Point operation at Heathrow, which incorporates the Pharma Zone, shared by Virgin Atlantic and its joint venture partner, Delta Cargo.</p>
      <p>The airline's pharma and life science shipments that recorded over 20 percent growth last year, is expected to see growth with this accreditation.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the airline also increased the range of active containers it offers for temperature-controlled cargoes by becoming the first UK airline to approve the use of CSafe's new RAP unit.</p>
      <p>Through its JV with Delta Cargo, Virgin now offers almost a quarter of all transatlantic cargo capacity, the busiest global lane for pharma shipments. Virgin serves a total of 11 US destinations, offering direct services to the UK and fast connections into Europe. Demand is also up for pharma services to India and China.</p>
      <p>Dominic Kennedy, MD of Virgin Atlantic Cargo said: "We have been listening to our customers and responding to what they want. Wholesale Distribution Authorisation (WDA) was the regulatory compliance they asked us to achieve and now we meet their requirements at both our global headquarters and Pharma Zone. We can measure our customers' approval by the increasing pharma bookings they are giving us. We are confident 2018 will be a record year for our pharma and life science business as customers commit to airlines like Virgin which are delivering tangible benefits."</p>
      <p>Virgin's Pharma Zone is a secure and segregated facility with GDP-trained staff dedicated to the handling and storage of pharma shipments.</p>
      <p>The airline's service offering for temperature-sensitive shipments is also benefiting from the co-location of its handling operations with Delta Cargo at major gateways in the UK and US.</p>
      <p>Darren Sherlock, manager - Products and Partnerships at Virgin Atlantic Cargo, added: "This is a further important enhancement of the pharma services we can offer to our customers and has been achieved with the fantastic support of our partners dnata and ASC Associates. We will continue to work closely with our customers to ensure that every benefit we deliver is based on what they need."</p>

      <p>Ground handler Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS) has launched a cargo tracking app to help keep customers up to date with the current status of shipments. The company said that the tracking app will be available at AISATS Air Freight Terminal and at AISATS Coolport, located at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), Bengaluru, a city known for its high tech industry. "AISATS is the first and the only air cargo operator at Bengaluru to develop this free on-the-go app to provide its customers with comprehensive cargo-tracking solutions," the handler said. The app picks up cargo movement data from the handlers cargo management system and provides real-time information on flight schedules, air waybill (AWB) shipment tracking and e-delivery order status. The user can input the AWB number and obtain the current status of a shipment such as date of uplift/arrival, number of pieces, weight as well as approval status of the delivery order through its e-delivery feature. "AISATS Cargo app will increase efficiency of the supply chain by relaying relevant information of the cargo to key stakeholders," the company said. The move is likely to be welcomed by the local logistics industry, which has long complained about the lack of visibility and delays to cargo at many of India's airports. Just last week, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry complained about lengthy dwell times at the country's airports.  "The aviation logistics sector in the country today, particularly for export cargo, and equally for the domestic cargo, is confronted with multitude of serious issues like inordinate dwell times, missing and non-traceable cargo, damaged cargo, lengthy cargo processing times and queues of trucks at the cargo terminals, etc. Air cargo infrastructure in India is woefully inadequate and overloaded," the chamber said. "Missing Cargo/non-traceability of cargo in terminals has assumed undesirable proportions. This has serious implications for not only timely delivery of cargo but also in terms of security and image of the country in international trade." Read more ground handler news</p>

      <p>Cargolux Airlines is seeing strong pharma traffic on routes Europe to the Midwestern US and back, manager for products, Stavros Evangelakakis (pictured below) says.</p>
      <p>He also explains demand into Asia remains high, especially in China and it is also seeing growth in the Middle East and South America.</p>
      <p>He says despite growing competition in this segment, Cargolux is growing its pharma tonnage during the first four months of 2017 and the single-digit growth is the result of its "unwavering dedication" to customers and the flexibility and willingness to adapt services and destinations to customer requirements.</p>
      <p>Evangelakakis adds: "It also shows that we are on the right track with our strategy. We believe in constantly developing and improving our processes, learning from the past and giving the customer what he expects from us.</p>
      <p>"We believe in transparency and honesty towards the customer as another step towards greater collaborative achievements. This would also include saying 'no' when we can't realistically offer what is expected from us."</p>
      <p>Pharma continues to be a vital sector for Cargolux. Evangelakakis says: "Cargolux has invested significant effort into the advancement and development of its CV Pharma product. We have performed an in-depth aircraft thermal analysis and developed air cargo covers with Dupont.</p>
      <p>"While we have put a lot of emphasis on passive solutions, we have felt that we needed to step up our game and also offer active solutions.</p>
      <p>"We have invested a lot of effort into our service and can offer temperature-controlled RFS that connect to any airport; we have special processes for temperature-controlled cargo on the ground and in the air, at origin and destination and offer complete transparency on the temperature range during the transport.</p>
      <p>"These premium services come with a price, of course, but they are accepted and appreciated by our customers who demand the fastest and most reliable solutions."</p>
      <p>Cargolux continues to develop its pharma capabilities and Evangelakakis says it has begun to introduce GDP principles and processes to additional stations and look at its track and trace system as well as future digitalisation of processes "that customers expect".</p>
      <p>Last month, Cargolux penned a partnership with Emirates SkyCargo that will see capacity utilised and routes added between Dubai and Luxembourg and set to boost pharma traffic.</p>
      <p>And Evangelakakis says Cargolux Italia remains a "pillar" of the business as is the main carrier of pharma shipments in and out of Italy, as well as countries like Switzerland.</p>
      <p>He notes pharma will also be one of the products it offers in its new venture Cargolux China as it has a lot of demand into China, while pharma exports from China are slowly rising.</p>
      <p>Evangelakakis is sure pharma growth is here to stay: "We believe this segment will continue to grow and Cargolux has the ability and the will to grow with it.</p>
      <p>"At the same time, we focus on the business and customers we already serve and invest in added value for them with constant personal contact and tailor-made solutions."</p>

      <p>Kuehne + Nagel's distribution center in Geel, Belgium.</p>
      <p>Following an expansion of its warehouse in Geel, Belgium, Kuehne + Nagel contracted with life-sciences company Sanofi to manage its warehouse activities in the city.</p>
      <p>K+N's warehouse includes temperature-controlled zones between 15°C and 25°C, as well as cold-storage areas ranging between -25°C and 8°C. K+N will store raw materials for Sanofi's pharmaceutical production and installed a special fire protection zone as well as a pressurized sample booth – which provides a cleanroom space to prevent cross-contamination between the materials and the outside environment – to meet the storage requirements.</p>
      <p>K+N has made a major push to expand its cold-chain offerings for pharma products and perishables during 2017, and subsequently saw a strong first half with about 66,000 tonnes of airfreight transported. The company added about 540,000 square meters of warehouse and logistics space over the first half of 2017.</p>

      <p>DHL Global Forwarding's airfreight station in Shanghai has been IATA CEIV Pharma certified, the first freight forwarder to receive certification in Asia.</p>
      <p>The air and ocean freight specialist within Deutsche Post DHL Group started certifying global stations to International Air Transport Association Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (IATA CEIV) in the third quarter of 2016 and the DHL Air Thermonet station received the quality label following independent audits by third parties and training courses for employees.</p>
      <p>DHL global head of temperature management solutions and chief executive officer (CEO) of LifeConEx at DHL Global Forwarding, David Bang says: "Over many years, DHL has been actively involved with IATA's continuous efforts to adequately answer to the regulatory demands of the pharmaceutical industry. This standardised approach in the air freight industry means productivity, accuracy, and reliability. All of those lead to product integrity and patient safety."</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding Greater China CEO, Steve Huang says: "The life sciences and healthcare industry increasingly requires more regulatory control over the years including the transportation and storage of highly-sensitive pharmaceutical goods."</p>
      <p>"Through the IATA CEIV Pharma Certification, DHL further shows its commitment to service quality when it comes to the delivery of these vital and temperature sensitive products."</p>
      <p>The Shanghai location has 1,405 square metres available in the air import warehouse and 245 square metres in the air export warehouse.</p>

      <p>Freightalia has partnered with the Pangea Group to give its network of more than 300 independent freight forwarders access to an automatic quoting system to help engage with exporters, importers and agents.</p>
      <p>The white label system is an automatic system for freight quoting and rate management that allows self-customisation from the platform branding to the system notifications.</p>
      <p>Each freight forwarder has its own Freightalia domain that can be completely incorporated into their current website, and the system is primarily focused on sales, the main bottleneck for a freight forwarder, which presents elevated costs for the company.</p>
      <p>Pangea Group network manager, Sarah Bidmead says: "There has been a lot of interest in the newly released system, as due to the fast-paced development of our modern world, freight forwarders have been receiving mounting pressure regarding digital changes. Various members are already users of the system and have created their own digital platform for automatic pricing."</p>
      <p>The network says that as customers demand faster pricing, a radical change in digital work systems is necessary as it is no longer feasible to wait for the prices from a supplier in order to send a quote to a potential client.</p>
      <p>Pangea says it is necessary to anticipate the input of the rates from suppliers, airlines and shipping companies in an updated and well-organised system, and effective management of rates is the first stop to make the pricing process become automatic and instantaneous.</p>
      <p>It adds that a powerful engine has to combine rates, items and specific markups for each client to deliver accurate offers in real-time.</p>

      <p>The automation and digitisation of healthcare supply chains will drive the development of future pharmaceutical supply chains, according to a report by DHL. The report identified six transformational trends that would affect future healthcare supply chains: big data analytics; the internet of things; healthcare on demand; robotics and automation; augmented reality and additive manufacturing. Bill Meahl, chief commercial officer, DHL said: "The Life Sciences and Healthcare sector is currently going through a transformational phase of its operating models and supply chains: The industry is affected by cost pressure from governments and regulatory authorities, changing consumer behaviour as well as the effects of digitalisation." The report states that big data will allow healthcare providers to make more informed decisions about the management of their operations by connecting all members of a healthcare system and combining data. This helps better predict demand and can cut cost and improves efficiency in Life Sciences logistics and supply chain operations. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies allow increased visibility and connectivity across the supply chain, with tighter control of product inventories across the supply chain, reducing loss and waste. Meanwhile, the development of healthcare on demand models will see the online pharmaceutical market grow to $128bn by 2023. As a result, delivery channels will be "transformed" with new direct-to-consumer delivery models and to increase speed and flexibility in last mile. The report predicts Life sciences manufacturers will also go further downstream into hospitals to enable on-demand delivery of devices from medical parts to surgery kits. The use of robots and automated vehicles will reduce labour required in repetitive tasks such as picking products in warehouses to sorting and analysing laboratory samples, while aerial drones will be used to enable faster, cheaper last mile deliveries in remote areas. Augmented reality will offer new ways of displaying and presenting information to make supply chain operations more accurate and efficient and additive manufacturing will enable medical devices and even drugs to be increasingly personalised and manufactured on demand using advanced 3D printing systems. "This will change treatments and transform supply chains, with more products manufactured close to the point of use and decentralized production networks," DHL said.</p>

      <p>Belgian air and sea cargo gateways are to benefit from the introduction of a new customs platform designed to simplify the import and export of goods, one particularly suitable for those businesses involved in e-commerce.</p>
      <p>The new BE-GATE customs platform was officially launched yesterday (June 6). The portal was developed on the initiative of the Belgium Customs and Excise Department and is said to be unlike any other to be found in Europe.</p>
      <p>The new platform is being supported by four important Belgian hubs of e-commerce: the ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge as well as the airports of Brussels and Liège.</p>
      <p>Free to use, BE-GATE is designed for processing large amounts of data and the rapid clearance of customs applications.</p>
      <p>A high number of arrival notifications can be transmitted simultaneously via an officially approved customs form.</p>
      <p>For shipments of less than or equal to 22 euros, this form also serves as a declaration of release for consumption.</p>
      <p>For all other shipments, an additional declaration in the Belgian customs software PLDA (PaperLess Douanes et Accises, or Paperless Customs &amp; Excise) is required.</p>
      <p>Retailers automatically receive information on those shipments that have been selected for customs control.</p>
      <p>Plus, the software provides a recommendation on customs value on the basis of defined criteria, if the value cannot be determined by an alternative method.</p>
      <p>To use the system, an economic operator has to have a registered office in Belgium and status as a customs agent.</p>
      <p>In addition, an intermediate warehouse or a location approved as a customs warehouse, authorisation for the use of the simplified declaration and a comprehensive guarantee are all required.</p>
      <p>Excise goods, goods subject to licenses and goods subject to special restrictions and control measures cannot use BE-GATE.</p>
      <p>For exports, BE-GATE can be used for shipments with a value of up to 1,000 euros and a weight of less than 1,000kg. Otherwise, an additional declaration in the PLDA form is required.</p>
      <p>Multimodal connectivity</p>
      <p>Airfreight hubs like Brussels and Liège connect Europe with the rest of the world. Furthermore, an extensive road, barge and rail network connects these Belgian airports to the hinterland.</p>
      <p>Multimodal shippers require an integrated approach of combining sea, air and rail freight transport depending on the urgency of the shipment.</p>
      <p>"As partners we invest in platforms and procedures to optimise this network," observed Werner Rens, head of the marketing department at Belgium Customs and Excise.</p>
      <p>"That way we can meet the e-commerce players' expectations about integrated gateways.</p>
      <p>"Moreover, our sea- and airports are centrally located in Europe. This optimal location and connectivity make Belgium a unique hotspot for omni channel logistics."</p>
      <p>Rens continued: "With BE-GATE, we have developed an efficient and effective e-commerce tool that prevents delays in the supply chain due to lack of transparency and communication. A win-win solution that also facilitates our work as a customs authority."</p>
      <p>Steven Verhasselt, vice president commercial at Liège Airport, commented: "Liège Airport started as a pioneer in full cargo airports about 20 years ago, hosting TNT's global air hub.</p>
      <p>"Since then, many years of growth have led us to become Europe's 7th biggest cargo airport, connected to 12 Chinese cities by air and by rail.</p>
      <p>"The express expertise is now fully deployed to accommodate large e-commerce flows and we expect BE-GATE to further optimise flows at Liege Airport."</p>
      <p>Steven Polmans, director cargo &amp; logistics at Brussels Airport, informed: "Brussels Airport offers a global network of both passenger bellyhold, express and full cargo aircraft capacity.</p>
      <p>"With our ongoing expansion and new warehouses under construction, we are ready for the growing business of e-commerce. BE-GATE will help us to be an even more attractive entry point for e-commerce thanks to its facilitation and transparency."</p>

      <p>IATA's World Cargo Symposium 2018 is now history, but between the 13 separate, concurrent tracks and all the networking that was done by more than 1,100 delegates in Dallas a couple weeks ago, chances are there were several words of wisdom you may have missed, even if you had attended every day.</p>
      <p>As a refresher for those who may have missed the symposium, we at Air Cargo World have assembled some of our favorite moments from the event and shared them below as our top 10 remarks overheard at the sessions, workshops or on the exhibition hall floor during the four days of the event. Which one was your favorite moment?</p>
      <p>"Our biggest challenge today is getting perishable cargo from the plane to the cool-chain facility ASAP."</p>
      <p>Despite all the technology that has been applied to the ground-handling aspect of air cargo, Kerry Galegher, seinor vice president of cargo for dnata's U.S. market, speaking at the WCS Perishables panel discussion, said the industry is still trying to solve the problem of handing off the cargo from the aircraft to the cool-chain facility. His fellow panelist, Burak Ömeroğlu, vice president of  cargo sales in the Middle East for Turkish Airlines, however, said that better communication between airlines and forwarders should improve, so that airlines better understand the forwarders' needs.</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo is stepping up its cooperation with start-up cargo.one by acquiring a minority shareholding in the Berlin company.</p>
      <p>Cargo.one was founded in 2017 by Moritz Claussen, Oliver Neumann and Mike Rotgers, providing a platform for booking and marketing air cargo capacity.</p>
      <p>It focuses on offering dynamic spot rates and enabling their booking, making cargo.one the first platform of its kind.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo chief executive officer and chairman of the executive board, Peter Gerber says cargo.one is an important step towards digitisation of the air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>He says: "We are pleased to have been one of the first airlines to recognise the potential of this multi-airline platform for our customers and to have made ourselves compatible. We are impressed with the technology and user-friendly product. We are also driving digitisation in our industry through cooperation with start-ups and financial investments such as that in cargo.one."</p>
      <p>Cargo.one founder, Moritz Claussen says: "The investment in our technology signals to our customers that cargo.one is a strong partner with which to join forces to drive air cargo digitisation. Air cargo capacity worldwide can be made available online through our innovative distribution technology. Accordingly, we want to grow to become a global leader. The minority investment by Lufthansa Cargo now also demonstrates that even a star player in the industry is impressed with our technology."</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo invested in technology start-up Fleet Logistics in early 2018, which acts as an online marketplace, matching customer demand for cargo services with free capacity.</p>
      <p>The airline has also been cooperating with technology accelerator, Plug and Play since February 2018, bringing technology start-ups and established companies together.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo head of digital transformation, Boris Hueske says: "The close cooperation between Lufthansa Cargo and technology start-ups melds comprehensive air cargo experience with a technology-driven, fresh view of global logistics processes.</p>
      <p>"By acquiring a share in cargo.one and Fleet Logistics, Lufthansa Cargo is emphasising its strategic commitment to elevating the air cargo industry to a higher level of digital maturity."</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo, the cargo and logistics arm of Etihad Aviation Group, has announced that it has joined the cross-industry associations Cool Chain Association and Pharma.Aero.</p>
      <p>The affiliation with the associations, which includes pharma shippers, CEIV certified cargo communities, airport operators and other air cargo industry stakeholders, provide the UAE-based carrier with active participation in the development of industry standards and processes.</p>
      <p>CEIV certification This comes less than a year after Etihad Cargo became the first regional carrier and airport hub in the Middle East to be awarded CEIV certification in Pharmaceutical Logistics, and only the second carrier in the world to obtain the CEIV certification in Perishables Logistics (Fresh) two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Its dedicated TempCheck and FreshForward products provide specially designed, temperature-controlled equipment to transport pharmaceuticals and perishable items in the quickest possible time, adhering to the highest compliance guidelines.</p>
      <p>Andre Blech, head, Cargo Operations and Delivery, Etihad Aviation Group, said: "Our memberships of the Cool Chain Association and Pharma.Aero are testament to the progress Etihad Cargo has made over the past 18 months as we continue to drive forward our ambition to provide reliable end-to-end air transportation for perishable and pharmaceutical shippers."</p>
      <p>The Cool Chain Association will provide Etihad Cargo with a strategic conduit for knowledge exchange and technological ideas, in addition to a tailored platform to expand its current government, industry and supply chain partnerships on a global level.</p>
      <p>Stavros Evangelakakis, chairman, Cool Chain Association and global product manager, Cargolux, said: "The CCA brings together industry leaders from across the cool chain to network, share insight, and trial new ideas. CCA members are focused on driving genuine change in the pharma and perishables cool chain with a focus on contributing to reducing waste and improving the lives of patients by ensuring transportation meets the requirements of the shipper, and Etihad will bring valuable insight and input from an airline perspective. We look forward to their contribution."</p>
      <p>Etihad Cargo's Pharma.Aero membership carries active participation at IATA LAPB meetings and regulation updates, ensuring its seat at the centre of industry-wide decision-making processes.</p>
      <p>Nathan De Valck, chairman, Pharma.Aero, said: "We welcome Etihad Cargo into the Pharma.Aero membership and look forward to their active contribution in our project groups to further improve pharma handling processes in collaboration with the pharmaceutical manufacturers.  As the first Middle East carrier to join Pharma.Aero, Etihad Cargo marks the expansion of our global membership into that region".</p>

      <p>Amerijet International has become the first all-cargo airline of US origin to earn IATA's CEIV-Pharma certification after being awarded the designation on June 27, 2017, the company stated in a press release. Successful completion of the certification process allows Amerijet to strengthen its promise to exceed the high standards set by the pharmaceutical industry. Amerijet has invested heavily in technology, infrastructure and processes over the last few years to ensure the safe handling and transportation of high-value and temperature sensitive cargo. "This certification reconfirms our commitment to offering the highest consistent quality, professionalism and transparency to our customers. Being the first all-cargo airline from the U.S. to receive the Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics is a direct result of hard work and the investments we have made over the last few years to our Temperature Controlled (ATC) program," said Vic Karjian, president and CEO of Amerijet International Airlines.Amerijet has more than 40 years of experience handling temperature sensitive air freight. The airline transports over 300 million pounds of freight including 65 million pounds of temperature controlled products annually. Amerijet's temperature controlled handling facility at the Miami airport includes a custom-built cooling facility equipped with active alarm systems, temperature data recorders and 24/7 CCTV monitoring. Computer monitored pharmaceutical cooling chambers provide storage environments for ambient 15°C - 25°C, chilled at 2°C - 8°C, and frozen at -0°C shipments.Rasheme Richardson, vice president of airport operations for Amerijet added, "As an airline, our role in the supply chain is to provide safe handling and to ensure temperature integrity for all pharmaceutical shipments. We demand the same uniform standards and processes from all of our business partners, including our handlers and trucking companies. Complying with the healthcare cold chain logistics standards, expected from pharmaceutical manufacturers and life sciences companies, helps to support the global healthcare initiative of putting patient safety first.""Amerijet's strategy to enhance its pharma shipping offering through investing in the latest cold chain technology and joining the IATA CEIV Pharma certification program demonstrates the airline's commitment to patient safety. We congratulate Amerijet for their achievement in meeting shippers' expectations in terms of standardization and transparency. This will contribute towards developing a stronger, more competitive and enhanced air cargo service for pharmaceuticals in North and Latin America for this vital sector," said Glyn Hughes, IATA Global Head of Cargo.</p>

      <p>A new pilot project between various users of Schiphol airport has sped up the transport of cargo between Germany and the Dutch airport by as much as two hours. As part of the Smart Cargo Mainport Program a data sharing project has been created for shipments between Air France KLM's Frankfurt facility and Schiphol airport, which speeds up the processing and transport times. Users submit various pieces of data, including Customs information and shipment details, to a central system that allows Schiphol, cargo handlers, truckers, forwarders, shippers, Customs and the airline to plan ahead for the cargo's arrival. Speaking at Tiaca's Air Cargo Forum, KLM Cargo executive vice president &amp; Martinair Holland managing director Marcel de Nooijer said that although the project was still in the pilot phase, it could save around two hours compared with shipments originating from its Frankfurt facility that are not taking part in the pilot. Eventually, other fast trade lanes could be created. The pilot project is being run by a consortium which brings together all sectors of the supply chain and includes Schiphol Cargo, Jan de Rijk Logistics, Swissport, Kuehne+Nagel, Cargonaut, and Dutch Customs. The information is submitted using a cloud-based system and is automatically verified against the applicable Customs regulations and safety standards. "Not only will this support the exchange of administrative data, it will also facilitate the exchange of status information relating to the shipments," said Schiphol. The pilot project is part of the wider Smart Cargo Mainport Program that brings together the Schiphol cargo community to create supply chain efficiencies. "This is a tangible innovation push for members of the Schiphol cargo community, aimed at realising efficiencies, reducing costs, and enhancing services," said Jonas van Stekelenburg, head of cargo, Schiphol Cargo. "The community is putting in the effort, with companies willing to take risks and spend resources, and we are seeing results. "The insight and learning we are gaining from the programme is open to all Schiphol cargo community members and we are seeking more projects and asking for more innovative ideas." Added de Nooijer: "We constantly have to deliver value in the hyper-competitive airfreight market.  "In the ideal supply chain it is all about co-operation and optimisation of the movement of shipments, both in the air as well as on the ground. Therefore transparency and access to data through digitisation is key. "The Smart Mainport Program is all about that; to ensure maximum value to our customers and strengthening the ground processes with all stakeholders. That is the power of innovative co-operation."</p>

      <p>The long, steady march of digitization in the air cargo world took another step forward this month with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) agreement to integrate IATA's Cargo-XML messaging standard into ASYCUDA World, the UNCTAD automated customs management system used by 90 countries worldwide for their customs procedures.</p>
      <p>What all this alphabet soup means is that "the industry is one step closer to achieving the global adoption of a standard air cargo messaging system," said Glyn Hughes, IATA's global head of cargo.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell, ASYCUDA World standardizes the electronic communications between airlines and customs authorities., covering declaration processes (for import and export), direct trader input, accounting, warehousing data, and temporary admission/importation. After gathering all of this information, ASYCUDA (short for Automated System for Customs Data) produces around 200 customizable reports and spits out data in raw or aggregated form that can be processed by other systems.</p>
      <p>Cargo-XML, meanwhile, "makes it easier for airlines, freight forwarders and shippers to ensure that the information being provided to the customs authorities is technically correct and in line with the standards of industry bodies such as the World Customs Organization and regulators," IATA said. IATA has promoted the ASYCUDA program to reduce message duplication and simplify communication across the supply chain.</p>
      <p>"Having a standard air cargo digital messaging system between customs authorities, airlines and other air cargo stakeholders is fundamental to enhancing efficiency, driving trade growth and maximizing safety and security across the industry," Hughes added. "IATA's successful partnership with UNCTAD means that airlines, freight-forwarders, shippers and border agencies in over 90 countries can now talk the same digital language."</p>
      <p>Those interested in learning more about where cargo IT and air freight are headed in 2017, should join us at Cargo Facts Asia in Shanghai, 25 – 26 April, where we will have a panel dedicated to the subject.  To register, or for more information, go to CargoFactsAsia.com.</p>

      <p>The Cargo iQ Membership Board has named DHL Global Forwarding senior vice president and global head of network carrier management, Henk Venema as its new chairman.</p>
      <p>Venema, who has over 15 years of experience in air cargo, takes over from Max Sauberschwarz, vice president and global head of carrier and gateway air logistics at Kuehne + Nagel, who chaired the IATA-interest group from 2013.</p>
      <p>Air France KLM Cargo director of operational integrity, compliance &amp; safety, Kester Meijer, will continue to support the group as its vice chairman. Sauberschwarz will continue to serve on the board.</p>
      <p>Cargo iQ executive director, Ariaen Zimmerman says: "It is an enormous accomplishment that Cargo iQ can count so many great industry leaders amongst its board members.</p>
      <p>"We owe a whole lot of gratitude to Max Sauberschwarz, who has done so much to get, and keep, us on the right track.</p>
      <p>"His leadership will be missed, but Max will remain on our board and I am confident that, in Henk Venema, we have found another great leader to help our Board and membership continue to improve the performance of the air cargo industry."</p>
      <p>Venema takes over as Cargo iQ continues to roll out a series of initiatives kick started under Sauberschwarz's chairmanship. This included the rebranding at IATA's World Cargo Symposium in Berlin, Germany, in 2016.</p>
      <p>"I am excited to be taking the role of Chairman as the organisation continues to innovate and develop, thanks to initiatives such as the new Smart Data Portal," says Venema.</p>
      <p>"Cargo iQ is a key initiative in the industry, where not only airlines, but also freight forwarders, handlers, and technology providers come together to define the joint and unique quality standards we want to set for the industry going forward.</p>
      <p>"The new projects we are working on, built upon the excellent work the organisation has successfully delivered so far, will further boost Cargo iQ's quality standards.</p>
      <p>"The new portal enables members to not only see data and trends, but also to act internally to improve levels of quality and fix specific pain points – an important diagnostic tool that will help to translate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into material actions."</p>
      <p>The new Smart Data Portal enables members to interrogate and interpret information about their service levels, helping them to develop new products and improve existing services.</p>
      <p>The group has also recently appointed an external auditor, Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS), to carry out its member Audit and Certification Scheme.</p>
      <p>Cargo iQ signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Global Shippers' Forum last year and recently met with a task force of shippers in London, UK, to start work on an initiative to launch shipper KPIs.</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has selected Quintiq to improve production planning at its hubs in Frankfurt and Munich, with additional stations following in the future.</p>
      <p>The Quintiq solution is able to generate a production plan seven days in advance, based on forecasted orders and closer to the day of operations the solution will start to fill the plan with actual orders.</p>
      <p>Using rapid optimisation technology, it will manage last minute updates as full information on orders may arrive just hours before the goods are scheduled for delivery.</p>
      <p>It will be integrated into Lufthansa Cargo's iCargo and Forecast systems, the three-way feedback loop between Forecast, Quintiq and iCargo drives more accurate plans on breakdown and build-up activities, and enables iCargo to monitor on-ground progress.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo chief operating officer, Soren Stark says: "We at Lufthansa Cargo are constantly looking for new ways to simplify operations and increase efficiency. Digitisation is key. It adds to our competitive advantage and gives value to our partners.</p>
      <p>"Our search for digitised processes led us to Quintiq. We are confident that Quintiq will enable us to offer better service to our customers and strengthen our market position."</p>
      <p>At the Frankfurt and Munich hubs, cargo needs to be broken down and built up for delivery to its next destination either by air or road.</p>
      <p>Quintiq will enable Lufthansa Cargo to make smarter decisions with regards to schedules and workstations for breakdown and build-up activities.</p>
      <p>The company will provide better visibility of inbound and outbound freight handling, the solution eliminates the need for long buffer time when reserving a workstation, freeing up capacity, limiting required space for storage and increase overall reliability for its customer.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo head of supply chain management, Tim Heppenheimer says: "The Quintiq team impressed us with their experience and ability to find simple solutions for our complex challenges. They were able to translate them into a powerful software solution that will improve our cargo handling operations and resource usage."</p>
      <p>Quintiq chief executive officer, Rob van Egmond adds: "Given its massive volume of production, the increased efficiency of breaking down and building up the cargo will make a great difference to its overall business performance."</p>

      <p>DB Schenker, Agility Logistics and Hellmann Worldwide Logistics have signed up to IATA's new air cargo rates platform, IATA Net Rates.</p>
      <p>IATA Net Rates aims to digitise the process of airlines and GSAs distributing rate sheets to forwarders using Excel spreadsheets and email, which the airline group said is "labor-intensive and doesn't allow for frequent updates".</p>
      <p>Sven Heinemann, Head of Global Data &amp; Contract Management Air/Ocean, DB Schenker, said: "The IATA  Net Rates Tool is an enabler to make our carrier rates fully automatic available in our Schenker's internal rate management systems. This will reduce manual effort and increase volume and data quality tremendously. We need all major airlines to participate in the program to enable fully automated end-to-end connectivity".</p>
      <p>IATA Net Rates announced during the last World Cargo Symposium that Qatar Airways had joined the platform, as the official launch carrier, and is actively working with global and regional airlines to join the programme shortly.</p>
      <p>Glyn Hughes, IATA Global Head of Cargo, added: "IATA is very pleased to be working with such an important and growing list of major freight forwarders.  Electronic tariff distribution is one important component of modernizing the entire distribution function."</p>
      <p>IATA Net Rates work closely with key industry groups, for the development of API standards and the integration of the solution with other IATA standards such as ONE Record and Cargo XML.</p>
      <p>Shawn Lee, Director, Global Airfreight Product, Agility Logistics, said: "Agility expects that our carrier partners will also see the benefits in using IATA Net Rate and believes that this will be the industry-wide standard in the future. It gives us full visibility at the headquarter level, which facilitates our global procurement process."</p>
      <p>Adding the global networks of three major freight forwarders prove that the industry is eager to develop programs that will protect their interests and support the digital transformation.</p>

      <p>Responding to growing demand for healthcare-oriented logistics, MNX Global Logistics has acquired Logical Freight Solutions (LFS), a Melbourne-based logistics solutions provider that specializes in healthcare logistics. "This is our biggest acquisition to date," said Ken Ying, MNX Global's global director of marketing. Ying told Air Cargo World the deal would increase healthcare's share of the company's operations to 60 percent.</p>
      <p>LFS specializes in life science, agricultural biotech, diagnostics, therapeutics, medical devices, microbiology, genomics, chemicals, radiopharmaceuticals, instruments and spare parts.</p>
      <p>The acquisition also broadens MNX Global's footprint in the Australasian market, with LFS locations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States.</p>
      <p>"The pace of growth in patient-centric medicine, with its strict requirements for temperature-controlled transportation and time-definite delivery, underscores the role that specialty time-critical logistics providers will continue to play in the life sciences and healthcare industries," said MNX CEO Paul J. Martins. He noted that, henceforth, customers would have access to an expanded suite of logistics services, tailored specifically for the healthcare, life sciences and medical device industries.</p>
      <p>LFS CEO Steve Cheetham added that Logical Freight Solutions had built up an infrastructure and specialized expertise that provided its customers with what he called, "true door-to-door service, from internal supplier to end-user." Cheetham added that joining MNX "increased the forwarder's geographical reach."</p>

    <content>
      <p>Dubai-based ground handler dnata, and a consortium of supply chain firms, has successfully completed a proof-of-concept test for a logistics platform that tracks supply chain transactions using hyper-secure blockchain technology. According to stakeholders in the project, the new system can eliminate redundant data and improve visibility and transparency.</p>
      <p>In a joint partnership, dnata, Emirates Innovation Lab, flydubai Cargo and IBM created a system that converted the companies' conventional, paper-based process of recording the handoff of cargo from each member of the supply chain – from the original purchase order all the way through delivery to the consignee warehouse. As a result, the blockchain test digitalized the supply chain and helped streamline the processes necessary to delivery cargo to its final destination.</p>
      <p>"The success of our study to use blockchain technology in our operations means greater security, efficiency and cost savings to our customers," said Kevin Ennis, vice president of commercial and business development for dnata's United Arab Emirates cargo operations. "We are on the cusp of revolutionizing the way we operate."</p>
      <p>Blockchain technology is a secure, public electronic network, which can be managed autonomously to exchange information and act as a permanent ledger of all transactions. The technology has also been described as "hack-proof" because no single party can modify, delete or edit any one of the digital "blocks" that automatically records each transaction without the consensus from others on the network.</p>
      <p>The technology "has great potential to exponentially improve efficiency and transparency of business networks, especially in cargo and logistic flows," said Neetan Chopra, senior vice president of IT strategic services for the Emirates Group. "However, neither the technology nor the potential is easy to understand or appreciate. Hence it is imperative to carry out such business experiments and trials so that participants can experience the benefits of breakthrough technologies in a live environment."</p>
      <p>Chopra added that the carrier's Innovation Lab will now work with their stakeholders to "scale out" the use of blockchain technology to "the larger cargo ecosystem."</p>
      <p>"Blockchain technology is able to transform sectors far beyond financial services," said Mohamed Hassan, vice president of collaborating airline flydubai Cargo. "It improves the way we work together in providing reliable and convenient airfreight as it provides end-to-end services."</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has founded 'heyworld', a simple and reliable transport solution for the e-commerce sector.</p>
      <p>As a wholly-owned subsidiary based in Frankfurt am Main, heyworld will be headed by Timo Schamber as the managing director. Its services, in the form of configurable, transparent and reliable transport solutions, will be especially designed for online retailers, digital marketplaces, online shop operators and forwarders.</p>
      <p>"With our dynamic team of experienced logisticians and retail experts, we will be able to create the best transport solutions for cross-border online trade," said Schamber.</p>
      <p>heyworld will offer a modular service portfolio characterised by convenient access, fast transport times, a high level of reliability, simple customs clearance, end-to-end shipment tracking and pricing at package level. It will embed Lufthansa Cargo's conventional airport-to-airport air cargo services into its transport solutions and integrate optional services, such as first-and last-mile transfers and handling add-ons.</p>
      <p>The ongoing digitization has resulted in new standards with multiple layers, especially in the e-commerce segment, that go beyond the conventional core business of a cargo airline. Hence, Germany-based carrier has introduced this new solution in order to offer custom solutions from a single source to meet these requirements in the future.</p>
      <p>"We have clearly identified the new customer requirements and developed an additional transport offering for online retailers," said Stefan Frankenhauser, head of Product &amp; Service Development at Lufthansa Cargo.</p>

      <p>Leading cargo carrier of Latin America LATAM Cargo gets Wipro's next generation CROAMIS information technology system for the carrier's total digital transformation. Wipro's CROAMIS automates end-to-end air cargo processes and will equip LATAM Cargo with the most sophisticated end-to-end air cargo management system in Latin America.</p>
      <p>The new system will be implemented gradually and is expected to be completely deployed by 2020. With the introduction of CROAMIS LATAM Cargo's customers will enjoy the convenience of a new tracking system, more and better self-service tools such as e-booking, e-claims, e-rates and a system that meets the highest industry standards.</p>
      <p>The new system will replace the various cargo management systems in use today with a single system that will include all business functionalities, from planning to money collection. "One of the most important and ambitious projects in our history," that's how LATAM Cargo describes the strategic project. Once the deployment is completed, towards the end of 2020, LATAM Cargo will have one of the industry's most modern and sophisticated system platforms.</p>
      <p>The system will provide customers with more advanced digital tools and will enhance efficiency by standardizing processes across different regions. It also aims to reduce cost as the system will work on the Software as a Service (SaaS) model.</p>
      <p>Due to the project's magnitude, 45 employees will be dedicated exclusively to its execution, with support from more than 100 associates.</p>
      <p>"Having a robust, modern and efficient technological platform is essential to remain competitive in today's air cargo industry. Wipro's CROAMIS cargo management solution will not only allow us to satisfy our customers' current needs, but also will enable us to meet future challenges. In addition, deploying this new system will increase our reliability and optimize our cost structure. The CROAMIS platform meets all our requirements to take a big leap forward in our domestic and international markets," said Andrés Bianchi, CEO, LATAM Cargo.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the partnership Deviprasad Rambhatla, Vice President &amp; Global Head – Travel, Transportation, Hospitality and Public Sector industries, Wipro, said: "With CROAMIS, we are bringing about digital transformation usually seen only in the passenger side of the airline industry to the world of air cargo. Wipro has assembled a highly talented team of airline cargo professionals from across the world, supported by a large pool of technology professionals to build a solid and scalable foundation for the CROAMIS community".</p>
      <p>The change to the new system will bring about a number of advantages: it will give the company more agility to satisfy the needs of its customers, adding considerably to its value chain. Once implemented, CROAMIS will offer LATAM Cargo's customers the convenience of a new tracking system, more and better self-service tools such as e-booking, e-claims, e-rates and a system in line with the highest industry standards.</p>
      <p>Replacing various systems will improve reliability and uptime; the product will be flexible enough to admit modifications in response to industry needs and allow the incorporation of new technologies. Finally, CROAMIS will translate into a substantial increase in company's efficiency by reducing the number of systems utilized and the associated infrastructure.</p>
      <p>"This end-to-end system will transform our internal operations as well as the way we interact with our customers. Having it places us at the forefront of the global air cargo industry, giving us the opportunity to be more efficient while offering greater autonomy and transparency to our customers," added Bianchi.</p>

      <p>Machine manufacturer ENGEL has centralised its spare parts logistics with cargo-partner at its iLogistics Center near Vienna Airport.</p>
      <p>The Schwertberg, Austria-headquartered manufacturer of injection moulding machines and parts handling automation has had rapid business growth over the past year, and storage space at its three production facilities in Austria were no longer sufficient to accommodate the high production volumes.</p>
      <p>The parts that had previously been stored at ENGEL's own facilities were moved to the iLogistics Center, and customers will now be supplied with spare parts from this distribution centre, either directly or via intermediary hubs operated by ENGEL.</p>
      <p>By transferring its spare parts logistics to a central location in immediate proximity to the airport, ENGEL enables later pick-up by transport providers as well as later order placement by clients.</p>
      <p>Shipments arriving from different production facilities can now be consolidated more efficiently, resulting in a more competitive cost structure.</p>
      <p>ENGEL Austria vice president customer service division, Harald Wegerer says: "The cargo-partner iLogistics Center came at the right time in exactly the right place for us. In addition to the fortunate location near Vienna Airport, the comprehensive technical equipment and fine-tuned processes were decisive factors for our choice. cargo-partner has fully convinced us with its competence in warehouse logistics and its flexibility in cooperation."</p>
      <p>The machine manufacturer's main requirements included the storage of small parts, pallets as well as long and heavy goods in a UV-, dust- and dirt-protected environment with constant air humidity.</p>
      <p>The requirements for processes and process areas were assessed over the scope of several planning workshops as procedures require separate areas for goods receipt and acceptance, picking and packing, outgoing goods and dispatch as well as quality control by ENGEL engineers.</p>
      <p>cargo-partner adapted the warehouse layout based on these standards and provided the required technical equipment, while a specially assembled team of cargo-partner employees was specifically trained by ENGEL for the required processes.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo is making a pre-emptive move towards the potentially disruptive tech sector, launching a Logistics Tech Accelerator with San Francisco-based RocketSpace, a technology campus which helps start-ups.</p>
      <p>The collaborative effort makes Lufthansa the first cargo airline to embrace disruptive tech start-up culture for supply chain management.</p>
      <p>The Accelerator programme's straplines are: "Be part of the disruption in logistics technology"; and "it's time to rethink logistics".</p>
      <p>The initiative aims to deliver innovative, tech-driven supply chain solutions, to respond to growing digitalisation trends and an increased need for real-time visibility.</p>
      <p>"There is a lack of digitisation and investment in IT solutions within the logistics industry, causing inefficiencies and boundaries for change," vice president of digitisation at Lufthansa Cargo Boris Hüske told The Loadstar.</p>
      <p>"Most likely there will be disruption, but when this will happen, we do not know."</p>
      <p>He added: "There will be changes; digitisation will influence the efficiency of the freight industry. These tech start-ups are addressing information flow, and this will also mean changes for sales and processes."</p>
      <p>The Logistics Tech Accelerator programme will train start-up companies in key supply chain objectives before delivering go-to market solutions. Mr Hüske said it would likely begin looking at optimised warehousing processes, smart tracking solutions to increase visibility and fulfilment optimisation.</p>
      <p>Mr Hüske said: "We want to get in contact with start-ups focusing on disruptive logistics solutions. Either we are driving change to digitisation within our industry or someone else will find another way to drive that change."</p>
      <p>CEO and founder of RocketSpace Duncan Logan said: "Global companies like Lufthansa Cargo working hand-in-hand with disruptive start-ups is a prime example of how industry can come together to fuel open innovation.</p>

      <p>International machine manufacturer Engel has centralised and optimised its spare parts logistics with the help of logistics firm cargo-partner and its new facility close to Vienna Airport. The operation is now based on cargo-partner's new 12,250sq m iLogistics Center which provides 24,500 pallet spaces as well as a small parts store with 32,000 bins. Engel Austria is an international manufacturer of injection moulding machines and parts-handling automation with headquarters in Schwertberg and was looking for a logistics provider that could help centralize and streamline its spare parts logistics. With rapid business growth over the past year, Engel found that storage space at its three production facilities in Austria was no longer sufficient to production volumes so parts storage was shifted to  the iLogistics Center which now supplies customers worldwide. The move also enabled later pick-up by transport providers as well as later order placement by clients while shipments arriving from different production facilities can now be consolidated more efficiently. The iLogistics Center offers a comprehensive high-bay rack system including small parts shelves and wide and narrow aisle shelving. The facility also offers a high level of protection against temperature changes, humidity and dirt. Engel's vice president customer service division Harald Wegerer said: "The iLogistics Center came at the right time in exactly the right place for us. In addition to the fortunate location near Vienna Airport, the comprehensive technical equipment and fine-tuned processes were decisive factors for our choice." </p>

      <p>Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) announced today that its logistics partners dnata cargo USA, SCL Cold Chain, B.I.G. Logistics and Expeditors were awarded IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) certification for pharmaceutical handling at DFW. After Miami International Airport (MIA), DFW is the second North American airport with a CEIV-certified pharma community covering the entirety of the logistics chain.</p>
      <p>The certification positions DFW nearer to its goal of establishing the airport as a "pharma gateway" and is part of a trend of airports building up existing partnerships with logistics providers to become airport communities. DFW is taking a proactive approach to establishing itself as a competitive hub airport, and last year partnered with Groupe ADP, the operator of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG), to "develop air cargo strategies" and cooperate to expand growth opportunities in several key industries, such as pharmaceutical transport, non-pharma perishables and various high-value luxury goods.</p>
      <p>Among DFW's logistics partners involved in launching the community's CEIV Pharma certification, dnata has been particularly active in seeking pharma handling certification and expanding its U.S. operations. In November, the ground handler invested US$8 million to launch operations at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and is CEIV Pharma-certified at its facilities in Amsterdam (AMS), Dubai (DXB), Singapore (SIN) and Toronto (YYZ). The ground handler also has Good Distribution Practices (GDP) certification at its AMS, London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), SIN and Zurich (ZRH) facilities.</p>
      <p>The 37,000 square-foot DFW cold-chain facility itself is operated by dnata, which released a separate statement on the CEIV-certification, stating that in the past 12 months it has handled more than 500 tonnes of perishables at DFW. The space includes two dedicated pharma chambers, three multi-temperature zones and a 15,000 square foot area for airside refrigeration. Other DFW cool-chain facilities include a refrigerated dock with truck doors, dry cargo space and a certified customs screening facility.</p>
      <p>As CEIV-Pharma certification continues to gain steam across the industry, IATA has launched new certificates for other specialty cargo. Last year, the industry association launched a CEIV certification for the transport of live animals, and at the World Cargo Symposium in Singapore this week, IATA launched CEIV-Fresh for perishables handling. Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) has already become the first CEIV-Fresh certified airport in the world.</p>
      <p>Those interested in learning more about specialty cargo demand are invited to join us at Cargo Facts Asia 2019, to be held 15-17 at the Langham Shanghai. For more information, or to register, visit www.cargofactsasia.com.</p>

      <p>Pharma.Aero has seen three more companies join the worldwide platform which aims to foster strong collaboration among its membership of airport communities, pharma shippers, and other pharma logistics stakeholders. Logistics company Expeditors and specialist cool-chain ULD provider Envirotainer have joined the organisation, along with Pharma.Aero's seventh airport member, Montevideo Free Airport, bringing the total number of member companies to 18. Nathan De Valck, chairman of Pharma.Aero, said: "The Pharma.Aero membership base is expanding to include all stakeholders in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Our cross-industry collaboration now involves pharmaceutical manufacturers, airports, airlines, logistics service providers and solution providers. "This large scope allows us to tackle a broad range of improvement projects in the Pharma.Aero working groups. Together with these air cargo stakeholders, we will develop global pharmaceutical trade lanes, implement best practices and share market knowledge and expertise." Peter Van Domburg, district manager Belgium &amp; Luxembourg for Expeditors, said: "Close partnerships, consistent global execution, targeted communications, and deep industry expertise allow Expeditors' logistics specialists to successfully navigate through the complexities of the healthcare industry. "Pharma.Aero personifies the answers to these needs and why Expeditors believes in the success of this kind of collaboration which helps preserve the integrity of Healthcare products for the patients at the end of the supply chain." Bruno Guella, managing director at MVD Free Airport, said that joining Pharma.Aero will provide "a solid platform for a better understanding of key tendencies and issues present throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain". Guella continued: "It hopes to provide the network with strategic insights on the challenges faced throughout emerging markets and the best practices and lessons learnt that will enable the industry itself to raise the bar in terms of quality distribution standards." Anna Levander, chief sales officer at Envirotainer, explained: "At Envirotainer we feel very strongly that bringing the industry together to collectively further best practices based on real experience is the way forward to secure the integrity of pharmaceutical products." Pharma.Aero was started by Brussels and Miami airports in October 2016. Read more Pharma Logistics news</p>

      <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) has launched THRUCOOL, a new service to transport high-value, time-sensitive and temperature-controlled pharmaceutical cargo with speed and reliability.</p>
      <p>With the introduction of THRUCOOL, the carrier offers dedicated cold chain services to safeguard the integrity of pharmaceutical and healthcare shipments during air transportation. These include priority uplift and handling, quick ramp transfers at airports, cold room facilities, as well as thermal blankets and covers for crucial insulation from external factors.</p>
      <p>Adding to it, the airline said, "Customers can also opt to place shipments in temperature-controlled containers, and track their location during shipping."</p>
      <p>In order to ensure further product integrity in cold chain handling both on the ground and in the air, SIA has partnered with leading terminal operators SATS, Cargologic and Qantas Freight to launch a 'quality corridor' along the Zurich-Singapore-Sydney route as an initial offering.</p>
      <p>Complying with standards adopted from the IATA CEIV Pharma1 programme, the quality corridor addresses the industry's need for safety, care and efficiency in the transportation of pharmaceutical and healthcare products. This reduces the potential for product loss attributed to handling and environmental factors such as temperature excursions during carriage.</p>
      <p>Chin Yau Seng, senior vice president Cargo, SIA said: "We are acutely aware of the life-saving role these shipments play in societies across the world and THRUCOOL is our assurance that our customers' cargo will receive the best care not only on our flights but also on the ground during transit. We will continue to collaborate with our industry partners to expand our network of quality corridors to further promote the integrity of pharmaceutical products in their journey across key trade lanes."</p>
      <p>SIA was the first airline in the Asia-Pacific region to be awarded the IATA CEIV Pharma Certification and is part of international and regional CEIV communities such as Pharma@Changi, and Pharma.Aero, which jointly pursue innovation in the shipping of pharmaceuticals.</p>

      <p>KEY businesses at Frankfurt Airport (FRA) have joined forces to strengthen the facility's position as a major global air cargo hub.  Newly-formed Air Cargo Community Frankfurt (ACCF) will represent and promote the interests of companies, optimise logistics processes and function as the single voice for the industry, says a statement. ACCF, representing airlines, handling agents, forwarders and other service providers, hopes to develop FRA as the most advanced air cargo hub in Europe by 2020, it adds. Agility Logistics, Air Canada Cargo, DAKOSY, Emirates SkyCargo, Lufthansa Cargo (LH Cargo) and LUG aircargo handling are among the members.  Dr Karl-Rudolf Rupprecht, head of operations at LH Cargo, has been elected chairman of the board, whilst Anke Giesen, executive board member and executive director, ground handling at FRA, is the new deputy chairwoman. "The strength of our association lies in the fact that we encompass the entire air cargo industry in our ranks, making us a powerful advocate for the industry," observes Rupprecht. "A decisive factor for the constructive cooperation of the members is that we are combining our expertise and ensuring its targeted use for the benefit of all members." Giesen adds: "We intend to assert ourselves against the competition and to expand our position as Europe's leading cargo airport."</p>

      <p>Logistics services provider B&amp;H Worldwide has been appointed by Ontic, a wholly owned subsidiary of BBA Aviation, to act as a warehouse and inventory management company to support Ontic's aircraft on ground (AOG) service provision around the world. A B&amp;H climate-controlled facility near Heathrow will act as a principal service centre. The facility, stocked exclusively with Ontic or Ontic-licenced parts, will offer 24 hour a day support. The centre's close proximity to London Heathrow offers the potential for rapid transport of parts through one of the world's best-connected airports. As well as parts, Ontic also provides maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services for legacy aerospace platforms from a number of facilities around the world. All shipments out of Heathrow will be co-ordinated through B&amp;H's OnTrack web portal. Through this, customers can log in to have their parts despatched – and provide comprehensive accompanying instructions on how this should take place – at any hour of the day or night. Meanwhile, parts are also transported into B&amp;H's Heathrow facility from all over the world. Any customer logged-in can identify where the stock is during the shipment process and can even see a picture of the stock item. "The bespoke nature of our service solution is what appealed to Ontic," said B&amp;H Worldwide's customer solutions manager, Chris Allen.

      <p>Dallas Fort Worth International Airport has been awarded Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) in pharmaceutical logistics by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).</p>
      <p>The Texan airport adopted the community approach for the certification process by assembling logistics partners specialised in ground handling, trucking, cold storage/warehousing and freight forwarding.</p>
      <p>The certification for the logistics partners involved training, pre-validation assessment, audit and validation. The founding members of the CEIV community are dnata cargo USA, SCL Cold Chain, B.I.G. Logistics and Expeditors.</p>
      <p>John Ackerman, executive vice president of global strategy and development at DFW Airport says: "The collective efforts of our partners to earn the CEIV Community certification demonstrates DFW's level of commitment to a world-class pharmaceutical handling operation that provides pharma manufacturers and shippers with confidence that their high-value products will be handled with quality, care and efficiency."</p>
      <p>The airport's cold chain facility operates 24/7 with capabilities for pharmaceutical freight. The 37,000 square foot space has two pharma chambers, three multi-temperature zones and a 15,000 square foot area for airside refrigeration. Additional features include a refrigerated dock with truck doors, dry cargo space and a certified customs screening facility for imports and exports.</p>
      <p>Glyn Hughes, global head of cargo at IATA says: "We applaud DFW for its commitment to building a CEIV Pharma community through which it has met the industry's global quality standards that ensure pharma products will be handled in a safe and reliable manner."</p>

      <p>Korean Air (KE) has opted for IBS Software's (IBS) cutting edge iCargo technology platform, discarding the legacy system in use for more than 30 years, in a move to enhance operational efficiency.</p>
      <p>This full-scale cargo management system has been implemented at 130 stations of KE across the globe.</p>
      <p>iCargo replaces a legacy software and nearly 35 disparate satellite systems with a single, unified, cloud-based platform covering the entire spectrum of cargo business including sales, booking engine, pricing, capacity control, cargo operations, air mail and cargo revenue accounting. The integrated technology solution will connect all the critical business functions of cargo movement which will considerably enhance customer experience, provide the agility to innovate at speed and position KE to execute at scale.</p>
      <p>With this new web-based solution, the carrier gets full control of the airline's cargo movement worldwide.</p>
      <p>The rollout also included the introduction of IBS' brand new suite of mobility capabilities including next-gen android based barcode scanners and apps on mobile devices such as tablets with integrated electronic workflows at Korean Air's global cargo hub at Seoul Incheon Airport.</p>
      <p>The Incheon cargo hub handles 1.6 million tonnes of cargo annually and manages 140 flights per day including KE's 20  dedicated freighter operations.</p>
      <p>Korean Air is a Cargo iQ certified carrier. The roll out will see the implementation of a fully integrated CDMP, quality audited and certified by Cargo iQ, which enables KE to directly measure and report Cargo iQ performance from its core system.</p>
      <p>The transformational implementation also included the launch of the brand new Korean Air Cargo website, developed from scratch in partnership with IBS, with a fully integrated business toolkit, that will facilitate online booking, tracking, e-airway bills, terminal operations, mail handling, revenue accounting and data warehouse capability.</p>
      <p>The next phase of the roll out will see the introduction of a fully integrated Cargo Revenue Management system developed using advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms in association with Korean Air.</p>
      <p>Noh Sam Sug, head of Cargo &amp; SVP, Korean Air Cargo said: "We also look forward to partner with IBS and the strong customer community of cargo industry leaders using the iCargo platform to make it even better than it is already."</p>
      <p>Ashok Rajan, head of Cargo &amp; Logistics Solutions, IBS Software said: "iCargo has indeed elevated itself to being the undisputed market leader and the right IT platform to provide airlines with a competitive edge to lead in a digital world."</p>

      <p>Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Brussels Airport have opened an airport-to-airport (A2A) pharma corridor to cater for the specific needs of pharmaceutical shipments.</p>
      <p>The pharma corridor connects the two airports, with shipments being handled in strict compliance with the IATA CEIV (Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics) and carried by CEIV certified airlines.</p>
      <p>Shippers will receive seamless temperature-controlled handling and provided with handling information.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with Pharma.Aero and the participation of pharma shippers, key performance indicators will be defined, targeting to set pharma handling standards.</p>
      <p>Alaina Shum, general manager of aviation logistics at Airport Authority Hong Kong says the collaboration marks a milestone to make Hong Kong "a preferred pharmaceutical transhipment hub".</p>
      <p>Shum says: "To ensure airport-wide seamless temperature-controlled handling, we are taking delivery of 19 additional cool dollies for common-use by the airlines, meaning that all airlines will always have the option to deploy cool dollies for their temperature-sensitive shipments.  We are also building apron shelters to protect the pharmaceutical shipments from direct weather elements."</p>
      <p>Steven Polmans, head of cargo and logistics at Brussels Airport says: "From the beginning, we have reached out to shippers and manufacturers to understand their requirements and work with them and the rest of our cargo community. We have been focusing on improving processes, finding innovative solutions and effectively implementing various projects."</p>
      <p>He adds: "This cooperation with HKIA for a dedicated pharma lane is a first but important step in creating specialised, dedicated pharma corridors. Our pharma volumes between Brussels and Hong Kong as well as the rest of Asia and Australia are significant, so this improved solution for our customers is being welcomed by the market very much."</p>
      <p>Frank Van Gelder, secretary general of Pharma.Aero says: "We have received great support from our members including pharmaceuticals companies MSD and Pfizer to participate in this pharma corridor project. Their participation will help to validate the services and key performance indices of the A2A pharma corridor, making sure it provides all pharmaceuticals shippers the genuine value and peace of mind."</p>

      <p>Digitalisation, IATA CEIV Pharma certification, aircraft with digitally powered temperature control, advanced track &amp; trace technology, and passive containers with 120hrs+ duration, is drastically changing the air cargo pharma supply chain while making it more reliable.</p>
      <p>Nahida Jafferi</p>
      <p>Due to cracks in the cold chain, the pharma industry is losing billions every year. Temperature deviations have to be avoided or else, it will further delay the import clearance. Moreover, to improve shelf life the prescribed temperature limits should be met and carefully monitored. Airlines and airports are making significant investments in ensuring that the facilities, equipment, operations and staff comply with all applicable standards, regulations and guidelines expected from pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p>
      <p>Active vs Passive Solutions</p>
      <p>The pharma supply chain stakeholders opt for active and passive packaging systems, on the basis of product characteristics, trade lane complexities and overall risk profile.  Current trend point towards growth in demand for both types of containers, however, the passive packaging system is evolving at a faster pace.</p>
      <p>"We've received signals that the usage of active containers is decreasing slightly. No doubt, this is partly due to the evolution in passive packaging, exceeding 120hrs. The latter, reducing risks might also be a reason to book pharma as general cargo for certain shipments," said Ferry van der Ent, director of business development at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.</p>
      <p>"Evidently, every manufacturer has set up their own closed distribution system, where every container is monitored for track &amp; trace, temperature, and humidity, by a kind of control tower," he noticed.</p>
      <p>A few years ago, Nils Markmann, VP- global operations, World Courier, had predicted that there would be more reliance on passive shipping solutions because it offers longer validation times and ease of handling in remote locations as well.</p>
      <p>However, DoKaSch Temperature Solutions, the Frankfurt-based company is expecting further growth in the global demand for pharma transports by actively controlled airfreight containers like DoKaSch Opticooler. It is also looking to expand its Opticooler fleet in 2019.</p>
      <p>Andreas Seitz, general manager, DoKaSch Temperature Solutions, said, "The development of pallet accepting devices with passive temperature controls has made progress in the past years, but active solutions will always have an advantage. The biggest advantage of electric/active solutions is probably the unlimited runtime; it only needs to be electrically recharged periodically."</p>
      <p>Seitz perceives that although airports are beefing up their standards and procedures for the pharmaceutical cold chain, moving pharmaceuticals globally across climate zones is still full of risks, and active containers are the most reliable solutions with the least risk for the cargo.</p>
      <p>Owing to market demand, Envirotainer also plans its RAP e2 active container network expansion. Stephen Maeitta, head of market development, Envirotainer, said, "The demand for active containers continues its strong growth trend due, but not limited, to the number of high value and temperature-sensitive biological products. We see additional usage expanding to other healthcare segments and industry verticals to help meet increased regulations and quality compliance."</p>
      <p>Some of the emerging trends that Envirotainer has noticed include extended active temperature control applied to a number of phases across the drug product life cycle, increased demand in Asia, shock and vibration control and monitoring, expanded services to meet growing customer requirements and most importantly - continuous improvement and collaboration across the temperature control airfreight stakeholders in the pursuit of a predictable cold chain process.</p>
      <p>SkyCell Container 1500 C  in cargo center</p>
      <p>On the other hand, SkyCell has developed passive containers that outperform active containers in duration on every lane. Marrie Groeneveld, chief commercial officer, SkyCell AG, said, "Soon 200 hours duration and more will be provided on passive containers. Active containers cannot extend the duration of passive containers as it depends on the battery and/or the amount of dry ice in the container. The SkyCell containers already provide over 160 hours duration under real-life circumstances."</p>
      <p>He also stated, "All SkyCell containers have been designed to serve a door to door requirement and can be treated as general cargo, contrary to the other containers that have to be carried in a so-called pharma lane, which has a very high rate per kilogram."</p>
      <p>As per an independent auditing company (one of the top five in the market), SkyCell provides reliability of 99.9 percent. "Many clients have seen dramatic reduction in temperature excursions from 10 percent to zero. In addition, the overall cost has been reduced up to 25 percent," informed Groeneveld.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect is the cargo compartment temperatures because air cargo demand will be mainly driven by aircraft bellies.</p>
      <p>Tom Grubb, global head of pharmaceuticals and healthcare, American Airlines Cargo, commented, "Unlike older aircraft, the new model aircraft have digital controls, which enable pilots to select specific temperatures. Processes for cockpit notification of temperature-sensitive shipments onboard provide optimum ambient conditions for shipments, highlighting the importance of packaging protection."</p>
      <p>Grubb also pointed that moderate ambient temperatures enable passive packaging to correctly regulate the internal product temperatures of the shipments.</p>
      <p>photo:  Unilode Aviation Solutions</p>
      <p>The transport of ambient products still remains the biggest challenge. Passive packaging is needed in order to properly protect shipments during transport to/from the airport, prior to ramp transfer or aircraft loading, and last-mile delivery.</p>
      <p>Brice Bellin, healthcare director, Europe, Bollore Logistics, said, "The use of passive packaging solutions may be a key solution for many companies facing problems with ambient products and making transportation cost-effective compared to active solutions."</p>
      <p>IATA CEIV's impact</p>
      <p>Standards such as GDP, the IATA Temperature Control Regulations (TCR), CEIV, among others, continue to play an increasingly important role with the need for enhanced quality and control in the supply chain.</p>
      <p>Rafael Figueroa, managing director-Cargo Operations and Customer Service, Delta Cargo, said, "We have seen growth in pharma volume since Delta received its CEIV certification, combined with the investments we have made in our facilities and our employees." The certification was awarded to the company at the headquarters level, and additionally at Delta's largest cargo hub located in Atlanta</p>
      <p>"Delta has created the first CEIV Pharma trans-Atlantic network connecting Atlanta with other existing CEIV Pharma certified partners, stations and handlers in Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan, Paris and Rome. Delta and its joint venture partner, Air France KLM Martinair Cargo, who is also CEIV Pharma certified, can transport pharmaceuticals across the extensive Delta, Air France and KLM networks, as well," added Figueroa.</p>
      <p>Pharma transport is teamwork throughout the supply chain. van der Ent said, "The various supply chain parties should act like being one logistics entity, controlling the supply chain from shipper to consignee, according to their requirements. IATA CEIV is a helpful tool speaking the same language globally while reducing risks and managing expectations." He further added, "At Pharma Gateway Amsterdam 20 parties are looking beyond their own interests, and are able to present a community proposition towards the pharmaceutical industry. To keep each other focused you have to give your partners feedback."</p>
      <p>Moreover, the lack of a common standard for auditing the participants in the chain is a considerable challenge. Robert Kleppers, Commercial Director, Jan de Rijk Logistics, said, "We continue to see the need to audit various partners which is, although time-consuming, but still a necessity. A common standard independently audited, as CEIV is a big help. It simplifies this process, makes value proposition towards the shippers clear and the supply chain easy to work with. "</p>
      <p>LATAM's pharma approach</p>
      <p>LATAM Cargo has also seen an increase in pharma volumes in the past few years. Rodolfo Marre, product development senior manager, LATAM Cargo, said "For all our Pharma shipments, we place at least one data logger to monitor the temperature and make sure it complies with the cargo's temperature range stated on the AWB, from the reception of the cargo to its delivery. In case it doesn't, a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) is triggered allowing us to perform continuous improvement."</p>
      <p>Also, LATAM's Marre expects forwarders to provide correct booking and a right label for proper delivery. "Correct booking is essential, given the wide range of pharmaceuticals and options to ship them. It is key to match the right product to fulfil each shipment's needs. Regarding our handlers, we expect that the cargo is handled, in accordance with the LATAM Cargo's SOP," stated Marre.</p>
      <p>Personal Care</p>
      <p>Alexander Kohnen, chief executive officer, time: matters, said, "The integrity of biological products and samples during the entire supply chain has always to be guaranteed. Special procedures, such as "do no x-ray &amp; upright loading", on-time delivery, continuous monitoring and documentation of the entire transport to prevent temperature deviations can only be achieved through the highest level of supervision by trained logistics specialists."</p>
      <p>DoKaSch Opticooler RAP maintains stable interior temperature  where ambient temperature reaches 50C or -30C</p>
      <p>Pharmaceutical products such as ATMPs (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products) need tailor-made, customised and transparent logistics concepts besides speed and reliability.  "Since about 10 years, time:matters offers specialised transport solutions for life-saving products like HSC (Hematopoietic Stem Cell) transplants. This segment has achieved above-average growth over this time period with several thousand international transports per year," informed Kohnen.</p>
      <p>Due to increasing customer inquiries in the field of logistics solutions for ATMPs, this segment has a strategic focus for time:matters.</p>
      <p>Digitalisation trend</p>
      <p>As the logistics solutions provider, Bollore Logistics uses a risk assessment tool that gives visibility on all risks at each trade lane. "Thus, we are able to select the right subcontractors and choose the best option for our customers to minimise the risks considering all the specifications of the products. Bollore's high technical standardised track &amp; trace system under real-time temperature control with proactive alerts allows taking immediate action in case of deviations. We have set up some 24/7-365 Competence Centers to follow the shipments and interfere if needed," said Bellin.</p>
      <p>There is still a lot of time consumed in distributing the essential information between partners in the supply chain. "Apart from direct system to system connections, Jan de Rijk Logistics developed a portal that enables customers to book directly, have complete insight in the operational and temperature status, freight documentation, settlement and billing," informed Kleppers.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Unilode has concluded a series of Proof of Technology (PoT) and Proof of Concept (PoC) of its digitalisation programme in collaboration with its ULD management customers, namely, Cathay Pacific, AirBridgeCargo and Air Canada.</p>
      <p>Benot Dumont, CEO, Unilode Aviation Solutions, said, "Unilode continues to invest heavily into the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0 based technologies, which will be used to equip the entire Unilode ULD fleet with digital tags. This will enable pharma customers to link serialised packing data with the container ID, securing transparency across the air cargo supply chain. Furthermore, the various sensors included in the Unilode solution will also record temperature, and send alerts when the unit is tampered with."</p>

      <p>LATAM Cargo is getting a better grip on its cargo as ULD provider Unilode, which manages the airline's ULD pool, is equipping the fleet with Bluetooth tags to keep track of them at any time.</p>
      <p>"Unilode's digitalisation programme will provide LATAM with opportunities to enhance our product offering by improving visibility and adding features such as temperature monitoring of the tracking devices fitted to our containers and pallets," said LATAM Cargo CEO Andrés Bianchi.</p>
      <p>Monitoring ambient shipment conditions is of major interest for the airline. According to Mr Bianchi, perishables account for about 50% of its volume.</p>
      <p>It has also ramped up its profile in the pharmaceutical arena and obtained CEIV accreditation.</p>
      <p>Both sectors have been going strong for LATAM Cargo: in pharmaceuticals, it has enjoyed double-digit growth in recent years; while perishables traffic has been growing, with exports to Asia a factor of increasing prominence. Unlike general cargo, most perishables markets have been either stable or shown growth this year, Mr Bianchi said.</p>
      <p>Unilode has been managing LATAM's ULD contingent since 2016 and opened a bespoke ULD repair centre at the airline's home base in Santiago. A spokesperson for LATAM reported that the fitting of its containers with the Bluetooth tags should be completed around the first quarter of next year, while the pallets should be done by the first quarter of 2021.</p>
      <p>Where a barcode requires staff to point a reader at the label, Bluetooth technology allows operators to manage ULDs without touch, said Unilode CEO Benoit Dumont. This increases visibility and 'reads' ULDs in locations that are difficult for staff to access.</p>
      <p>Unilode is working to put Bluetooth tags on its entire fleet of over 140,000 units. In the opening phase it is fitting them on pallets and containers of clients that have their own equipment pools. This is more straightforward than with Unilode's proprietary ULD pool that is shared by multiple clients, as the process of getting the all clear from all these clients takes time.</p>
      <p>Mr Dumont reports the approval process is nearly complete. He aims to have 70-80% of the network covered in about 18 months, which should be a good critical mass, he said.</p>
      <p>A large number of tests – many involving temperature-sensitive cargo like flowers or pharmaceuticals – have been conducted, all of them successfully, he reported.</p>
      <p>While the Bluetooth tags and readers installed on planes and on the ground will give LATAM much better visibility on the location of ULDs, and their ambient conditions, for Mr Bianchi this is but one part of a broader push for real-time access to data.</p>
      <p>The airline is working to replace its legacy system, a process that will replace a number of systems with a single end-to-end platform that is scheduled to go live halfway through next year.</p>
      <p>"With this we will be able to provide much better tracking," he said.</p>

      <p>Air France KLM will roll out its new airside temperature-controlled transporters in Los Angeles and Mexico. The Franco-Dutch airline has developed the new Kold Kart transporters to try and solve the issue of temperature fluctuations during ramp handling operations. Forwarders and shippers have long complained that their sensitive pharmaceutical shipments face temperature spikes when being loaded and unloaded. Air France KLM said: "When it comes to carrying temperature sensitive cargo — whether perishables or pharmaceuticals products — keeping the entire logistic chain of transport at the right cool temperature, required both by the shippers and by the products constraints, is a must for our group of airlines whose permanent concern is to provide the adequate solution expected by its customers. "This is all the more true for locations — such as Mexico for instance — where high temperatures are experienced on a regular basis and where the ramp operations are quite distant from the warehouse." A company spokesperson said Los Angeles and Mexico would be the first locations to receive the Kool Karts but added that the airline will "consider progressively" if they are also needed in other stations. Last year, Brussels Airport launched its own airside pharma transporter. Qatar Airways senior manager cargo products David Beecham said it had avoided this problem by using temperature controlled vehicles to take cargo directly to and from the loading ramp. This meant perishable cargo would be exposed for as little as 40 seconds. </p>

      <p>Marken, the UPS pharma supply chain arm, has gained approval from Brazil's health regulator ANVISA to ship biological samples from Sao Paulo's Viracopos airport to the US, using the parent group's airline. The pilot programme approved by the Brazilian authorities will permit biologic samples to depart from a second Sao Paulo airport to the US, allowing Marken to take advantage of an existing UPS flight to any US city.  The new hybrid service extends the latest pick up times for 21 Brazilian cities by up to five hours, said Marken in a statement, allowing investigators more time to prepare and package the sample. This additional flexibility, allows Marken "the ability to offer the fastest transit times and best value when compared to other couriers".  Marken, purchased by UPS in December 2016, will manage all aspects of the shipment including all investigator orders, export documentation and shipment status updates for full end-to-end visibility.  The statement added: The use of the UPS aircraft also reduces reliance on commercial airlines, which can offload biologic cargo from time to time leading to shipment delays.   "Marken has gradually increased its staff in Brazil due to the continued strong demand from cities in Brazil which are an important source of patients for clinical trials. Additionally, Marken has deployed members of its Mexico operations team to assist with the new service from Brazil, given the success of a similar hybrid service from Mexico City launched a year ago."   Wes Wheeler, Marken's chief executive, said: "Brazil becomes the latest country from which we can offer a hybrid transport option to the United States.  The new option, which allows use of a second Sao Paulo – based airport at Viracopos provides maximum flexibility for our clients.  "We can offer later pick-up times, earlier US delivery times and reduced paperwork for investigators in many Brazilian cities.  We are the only clinical courier who can offer this level of flexibility and value. We will continue to develop hybrid options for many other cities throughout the world." Marken manages 50,000 drug and biological shipments every month at all temperature ranges in more than 150 countries.

      <p>Dnata, Emirates Innovation Lab, flydubai Cargo, and IBM have completed a proof of concept (PoC) using blockchain technology for air cargo in Dubai.</p>
      <p>They says this has added value by eliminating redundant data and improve visibility and transparency and as a result, processes can been more streamlined and simplified right from the origin to the final destination.</p>
      <p>Dnata's UAE cargo operations vice president commercial and business development, Kevin Ennis says: "dnata has always been at the forefront of innovation, and the success of our study to use blockchain technology in our operations means greater security, efficiency and cost savings to our customers.</p>
      <p>"We are on the cusp of revolutionising the way we operate, and the success of this initiative with our partners will give the industry a real boost towards seamless service delivery. "</p>
      <p>Blockchain technology is a secure, public electronic ledger and peer-to-peer network, that can be managed autonomously to exchange information between different parties.</p>
      <p>In cargo much of the processes are traditionally paper based, which requires multiple sign-offs by inspectors and receivers before goods can be delivered. Even when the system is electronic, it still requires multiple parties to sign off on cargo shipments, creating a lengthy administrative process.</p>
      <p>Flydubai Cargo and dnata, in collaboration with Emirates Innovation Lab and IBM jointly developed a logistics platform in which blockchain infrastructure was implemented for supply chain transactions from a purchase order from the origin to delivery to the Consignee warehouse at its destination.</p>
      <p>All the partners were able to identify issues from various perspectives such as technology, security, operation, legal perspectives, to develop new supply chain services including digitalisation of documents.</p>
      <p>Emirates Group senior vice president for IT strategic services, Neetan Chopra says: "Blockchain technology has great potential to exponentially improve efficiency and transparency of business networks, especially in Cargo &amp; Logistic flows. However neither the technology nor the potential is easy to understand or appreciate.</p>
      <p>"Hence it is imperative to carry out such business experiments and trials so that participants can experience the benefits of breakthrough technologies in a live environment."</p>
      <p>Data says blockchain technology for its cargo operations is a very secure way to share information between parties. It creates a permanent, digital public ledger of transactions which can be shared amongst a distributed network of computers.</p>
      <p>The sharing possibilities of this technology create endless opportunities for logistics/supply chain applications. These include improvements of transparency and data sharing across the supply chain, better tracking of orders, reducing errors and better fraud detection.</p>
      <p>Flydubai Cargo vice president, Mohamed Hassan says: "Blockchain technology is able to transform sectors far beyond financial services. It improves the way we work together in providing reliable and convenient airfreight as it provides end-to-end services."</p>

      <p>Logistics firm B&amp;H Worldwide has launched FirstTrac, the fully web-based successor to its customer service system, OnTrack. </p>
      <p>FirstTrac comes with new AOG and critical monitors for customers and will also be used by its global control tower teams to provide "enhanced visibility of shipments".</p>
      <p>Designed by B&amp;H's in-house IT development division, InTech, the new FirstTrac is the result of an 18 month programme of work to create an integrated customer solution. </p>
      <p>Said a spokesperson for forwarder: "Leading edge IT is the key to success in the fast-paced aerospace logistics sector and FirstTrac's new architecture utilising APIs (architecture programme interfaces) to communicate within the application and external sources such as customer and supplier systems."</p>
      <p>Customers around the world use the same interface as B&amp;H employees in any location which also allows the company to provide consistent support.  The user-friendly nature of FirstTrac means it is fully interactive and can also be used on tablets. </p>
      <p>Customers can now be more proactive in monitoring orders which separate AOG and Critical Monitors as FirstTrac uses a traffic light system to highlight up and coming milestones, past milestones and timeframes.</p>
      <p>Says B&amp;H InTech managing director Seth Profit: "Keeping ourselves and our customers at the cutting edge of IT development in this industry is a vital part of our success story. </p>
      <p>"The new and rigorously tested FirstTrac system is the latest step in that process and we believe the enhancements and added service benefits will ensure we maintain our market-leading position".</p>

      <p>IAG Cargo has announced that it will expand its time-critical service to include pharma shipments. The airline group, which includes British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, said that following successful trials of its Constant Climate Critical service across India, the UK and Europe, IAG Cargo is rolling out this new offering across all 109 Constant Climate enabled stations on its network. The new enhancement means that shippers sending urgent pharmaceuticals now have access to the non-off loadable status and performance guarantees offered under its Critical product. The service offers guaranteed capacity up to the maximum aircraft operating limit, and a dedicated monitoring service through hubs at London Heathrow, Madrid and Dublin. Customers shipping through the carrier's Heathrow and Madrid hubs will also benefit from a dedicated Critical check-in desk, significantly speeding up drop off and collection times. IAG Cargo global head, pharmaceuticals and life sciences, Alan Dorling said: "We were one of the first carriers to offer a dedicated pharmaceutical shipment product and today our teams across the world deliver the highest level of care and expertise when transporting high-value, temperature-sensitive goods. "The development of Constant Climate Critical means that we are now able to build on our offering by providing vital vaccines and emergency lifesaving medicines with a non-off loadable status. "In addition to our highest priority grading, the product continues to safeguard temperature-specific shipment requirements, maintaining the purity, potency and stability of the lifesaving medicines that we carry." Less than a year since its launch, Critical has already carried over 2000 emergency shipments for businesses across the world. The range of goods moved has been diverse, from pre-launch consumer electronic devices to formula one tyres to factory down machine parts. David Shepherd, commercial director at IAG Cargo, said: "Critical has been a real success; demand has come from right across our network and week on week we see both new requests and repeat business. "We know that there is a real demand for guaranteed capacity and a must-fly service for urgent pharmaceutical products and it is crucial that we continue to innovate to ensure that we meet our customers' needs."

    <title>Cargologic obtains IATA CEIV pharma certificate</title>

      <p>Cargologic has obtained certification as a Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) from the International Air Transport Assocation (IATA) for the handling of pharmaceutical products at Zurich Airport.</p>
      <p>The cargo handler says temperature-controlled handling of pharma is becoming "increasingly challenging" owing to global regulatory conditions.</p>
      <p>In July 2015, the Swiss Confederation adapted the Medicinal Products Licensing Ordinance and adopted the European Union "Good Distribution Practice" guidelines, which entail stricter requirements for all players involved in the logistics chain.</p>
      <p>Cargologic says the certificate is confirmation that it ensures the quality of all temperature-sensitive airfreight consignments entrusted to it in all stages of handling, storage and transport.</p>
      <p>IATA's global head of cargo, Glyn Hughes, says: "Transporting and handling pharmaceuticals present both challenges and opportunities for stakeholders in the logistics industry.</p>
      <p>"Recognizing this, IATA has created CEIV Pharma, to help airlines, handlers and forwarders be compliant with international regulations, and in turn, make airfreight the modal choice for the transportation of pharmaceutical products."</p>
      <p>Cargologic managing director, Marco Gredig, says the company has been working hard to ensure product integrity of pharma shipments. "This further enhancement of their quality service offering goes in line with our constant aim to respond to the needs of the industry and provide participants in the air cargo value chain with the tools to ensure that they are operating to the highest standards for the transport of what in many cases are life-saving drugs and medicines," Gredig explains.</p>
      <p>"This important certification shows that Cargologic's services in airfreight handling, even of sensitive goods, meet the highest standards. We are continuously developing our leading-edge expertise on behalf of Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturers and consumers, and our operating and technical competencies are state-of-the-art," Gredig adds.</p>
      <p>Cargologic received authorization from Swissmedic for the transshipment of medicinal products at Zurich Airport in December 2013 and for EuroAirport (Basel) in April 2015.</p>
      <p>The company says it plans to apply for IATA CEIV pharmaceutical certification in Basel and Berne in the near future.</p>

      <p>Dallas Fort Worth International airport (DFW) is working with India's Hyderabad airport to develop pharma product flows after the US hub's cargo community gained IATA's CEIV Pharma certification.</p>
      <p>John Ackerman, executive vice president of global strategy and development at DFW Airport, said: "We have been spending time in Hyderabad and Mumbai over the past year because there is tremendous demand for pharma trade flows to DFW. We are actively talking to a couple of airlines and several Indian pharma producers about that."</p>
      <p>Those airline discussions are focused on establishing a freighter connection from India to DFW: "Given aircraft ranges, that is unlikely to be a direct flight, so there would have to be a stop some place. We are actively pursuing that and the airlines are very interested. </p>
      <p>"There is tremendous pent up demand and when I visited Hyderabad in late January I spoke with several companies that were very excited about DFW but they were not aware that we are a viable pharma gateway. We are working hard to change that perception."</p>
      <p>The Texan hub, which handled around 911,000 tons of airfreight in 2018, is one of only two airports in North America to gain CEIV Pharma certification.</p>
      <p>Ground handler dnata Cargo USA has a 37,000 sq ft cargo centre that includes a dedicated cool-chain perishable cargo facility at DFW.</p>
      <p>The airport teamed up with four DFW community members as part of the CEIV Pharma programme: dnata Cargo USA, reefer trucker SCL Cold Chain, warehousing and distribution specialist B.I.G. Logistics and freight forwarder Expeditors.</p>
      <p>Added Ackerman: "When we worked on perishables and pharma as a subset of that, we knew that we needed two things: a world class cool chain facility, which opened a little over a year ago with dnata, and then CEIV Pharma.</p>
      <p>"Now that we have those two things in place, we expect the pharma shipments to go up."</p>
      <p>He continued: "We wanted to demonstrate our commitment to CEIV and it is relatively new for the US. We have only the second CEIV community in the US."</p>
      <p>DFW has its charter members for CEIV Pharma and expects that more will be added over time: "For now we are starting with those four, a great nucleus with outstanding companies that are leaders in the industry and in our region."</p>
      <p>Asked about the catchment area for pharma products at DFW, Ackerman said: "We are the fourth largest metropolitan area in the US, so we have a great deal of local demand in our own right. So some of this [pharma products] would stay in the local market, some of it would transit to Latin America." </p>
      <p>There may also be the possibility of winning pharma traffic from inbound gateways such as Chicago where onward trucking links suffer from traffic congestion.</p>
      <p>DFW's cargo team is working with Indian airports group GMR, which runs Hyderabad,  to develop those pharma flows: "We have found on the passenger side that when the airports at either end of the route work together then you tend to be more successful.</p>
      <p>"We are employing that same model with Hyderabad, which has invested a tremendous amount in developing cargo business at the airport.</p>
      <p>"They are keen to establish a trade lane with DFW and have seen a lot of demand for it on their side. We think that will help us accelerate the process."</p>
      <p>DFW's cargo management team also has close links with Brussels airport and French airports group ADP, which runs Paris CDG.</p>
      <p>While not yet part of the Pharma.Aero collaborative platform championed by Brussels, Ackerman said: "It is something we are exploring but we are also looking at how we would build that digital ecosystem here as well.</p>
      <p>"We believe that, just like Brussels, you need not just the physical infrastructure, the buildings, the players and CEIV Pharma, but also the digital platform which is becoming increasingly important.</p>
      <p>"We have to address that as well and we have got a couple of my colleagues looking here at what the best option for us."</p>
      <p>DFW signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with ADP in late 2018 to work on developing the DFW-Paris trade lane: "We have identified a couple of different trade lanes that we think are promising and one is pharma. We can learn a lot from the ADP team."</p>

      <p>Management consulting and technology firm Accenture has released a new version of its Air Cargo Suite and has made it available as software as a service (SaaS). It says that the package, which includes reservations, routing, price and operations functions can improve workflows and help reduce revenue leakage and is aimed especially at small and medium sized air cargo carriers that may lack their own technological resources. New flight planning functions allow users to offload, re-assign and handle priority shipments so as to enhance flight utilisation and revenue. An air waybill control automates the billing process and monitors reconciliation of shipment details at different stages of the transaction, while a built-in workflow process allows flexible reconciliation and verifies that the correct rates and charges are applied. It also allows customer service staff to more easily sell additional products or services. Other enhancements have reduced the time needed to create a quote, with better visibility of available routes and rates. Improvements to partner flight management capabilities give more flexibility and control in sharing flights. Accenture's global managing director of freight and logistics software, Malcolm McNamara, said: "Technology is turning some of cargo carriers' greatest challenges – data transparency, process visibility and revenue leakage – into growth opportunities. Providing SaaS delivery options for Accenture Air Cargo Suite and new features will help carriers align processes around pricing, booking, capacity, routes and costs, ultimately driving profitability."</p>

      <p>Logistics giant Panalpina has successfully piloted its new, fully automated online quotation and booking platform for ad hoc cargo with selected airfreight customers. Panalpina chief executive Stefan Karlen said: "We have recently reached a significant milestone in modernising the company's systems landscape by successfully rolling out our new state-of-the-art operational platform in Germany – one of our key markets. "Now, Panalpina is taking the next logical step in creating a seamless customer experience that will make managing global shipments faster and simpler." The Switzerland-based forwarder's new centralised digital platform provides customers with a "fast, simple and reliable online interface" that enables informed decision-making by giving access to "easy and instantaneous quotation and booking of ad hoc shipments globally". Some of the first key customer benefits of the new platform are instant freight quotations due to an automated rate calculation "without human intervention". Other benefits highlighted by Panalpina for using the platform are quoted rates covering door-to-door transactions including pre- and on-carriage, and also the ability for rates to be viewed and then the freight booked "instantaneously with a few mouse-clicks and without the need to pick up a phone or write an email". Lucas Kuehner, global head of airfreight at Panalpina, said: "The platform offers key features such as dynamic pricing, global coverage and online 24/7 accessibility. "In today's highly volatile market environment, our automated platform allows us to respond very quickly to customer inquiries by providing competitive rates as well as cargo capacity either through our Charter Network or best-in-class partner carriers." Ralf Morawietz, Panalpina's chief information officer, explained: "Today, anyone can easily set up an appealing front-end tool for freight quotation or booking.  "The key question to ask is: What happens on the back end when a query is triggered? In our case, sophisticated algorithms immediately scan the industry's most comprehensive online databases, without manual intervention, to calculate the best freight rates and options for our customers." Karlen added: "We are excited to launch the platform in the first quarter of next year, and thereafter extend this new-generation digital portal across our entire product portfolio and customer base." Panalpina went live with its new transportation management system at the end of May this year, in different business units throughout Germany. Before the actual go-live took place in Germany, a major release upgrade was installed. Completion of the roll-out in Germany meant that about 30% of all transactions will be handled on the new platform. A company spokesperson said at the time: "Panalpina Germany is our third biggest organization in terms of shipment transactions globally. The successful roll-out in Germany will further confirm the system's capabilities." Read more Technology and freight forwarder news </p>

      <p>Chile-based LATAM Cargo Group is implementing a new end-to-end cargo management system, CROAMIS, developed by global IT, consulting and business process services company Wipro. The next-generation system is expected to be completely deployed by 2020 and will replace several existing systems, thereby increasing efficiency. Covering all business functionalities, from planning to money collection, it will equip the airline's customers with a new tracking system, as well as self-service tools such as e-booking, e-claims and e-rates. LATAM Cargo chief executive Andrés Bianchi said: "Having a robust, modern and efficient technological platform is essential to remain competitive in today's air cargo industry. "Wipro's CROAMIS cargo management solution will not only allow us to satisfy our customers' current needs, but also will enable us to meet future challenges. In addition, deploying this new system will increase our reliability and optimise our cost structure. "The CROAMIS platform meets all our requirements to take a big leap forward in our domestic and international markets," he said, adding that as well transforming the carrier's internal operations, the new system will offer greater autonomy and transparency to its customers." Wipro vice president and global head – travel, transportation, hospitality and public sector industries Deviprasad Rambhatla said: "With CROAMIS, we are bringing about digital transformation usually seen only in the passenger side of the airline industry to the world of air cargo."</p>

    <content>
      <p>This week, Austrian logistics services company cargo-partner has made the launch of its Fischamend facility near Vienna Airport (VIE) official, after several months of successful operations, exactly one year after the commencement of its construction.</p>
      <p>The 12,250 square-meter "iLogistics Center," as cargo-partner calls it, contains 24,500 pallet slots, 32,000 small parts bins and 2,000 square meters of operative handling area. The company said the facility is capable of handling "sensitive small parts," standard pallets, long and heavy goods, and e-commerce parcels, and offers value added services.</p>
      <p>Harald Wegerer, vice president of customer service at ENGEL – a client of cargo-partner and manufacturer of injection molding machines – said the company chose to utilize the iLogistics Center last June due because it met its requirements of "high process security, late cut-off times for incoming orders, and guaranteed same-day delivery." Cargo-partner has transferred 27,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) from ENGEL's production facilities to the iLogistics Center to date.</p>
      <p>In recent years, cargo-partner has invested in the expansion of its worldwide contract logistics capacity. Its most recent investments include similar iLogistics Centers in Eastern Europe, with facilities in Sofia, Bulgaria and Ljubljana, Slovenia, as well as the ongoing expansion of a center in Dunajska Streda, Slovakia. In February of this year, the company told of its intent to increase its Southeast Asian footprint, as well.</p>

      <p>WeCargo event, an air freight forum devoted to innovation in the sector, will be held from November 7 to 14, 2019.</p>
      <p>Organized by LeanSquare, a VC fund based in Liege, and Liege Airport, this programme aims to support the most promising international air freight start-ups.</p>
      <p>The partnership between Liege Airport and LeanSquare to create an innovation laboratory (www.wecargo.be) will bring aviation logistics leaders, innovators and investment funds together at the airport to take stock of business needs and work on solutions.</p>
      <p>The week of acceleration will consist of:</p>
      <p>• Individual mentorships with experts</p>
      <p>• Guidance developing financial proposals</p>
      <p>• Complimentary access to the WeCargo Summit &amp; networking events</p>
      <p>• On-stage presentations at the WeCargo pitch competition</p>
      <p>• One on one meetings with air cargo executives and VC's</p>
      <p>Alibaba, Qatar Airways Cargo and Orange are participating in this acceleration.</p>
      <p>On their participation, Luc Partoune, CEO of Liege Airport said: "The presence of Alibaba, Qatar Airways and Orange at our side will enable us to get directly to the core of the profession and give WeCargo an international dimension from the very outset. It's also a great opportunity for start-ups to be in touch with industry majors in the sector."</p>
      <p>The world of air transport is obviously part and parcel of the digital revolution. Whether it is digitalisation of information systems, flow management thanks to big data analysis, drones and autonomous vehicles, connected objects etc., new technologies are moving faster than an aircraft!</p>
      <p>Partoune adds: "The arrival of the e-commerce giant Alibaba with its first European air hub in Liege is an opportunity to capitalise on the know-how of the airport. If we want to stay at the forefront and continue to grow as an airport entirely dedicated to cargo, we must stimulate our ecosystem. This is the main goal of WeCargo: to stimulate and inspire the international cargo community. Secondly, start-ups will have the opportunity to move to Liege because they will benefit from a complete, dynamic environment at the heart of the action."</p>

      <p>Brussels Airport has revealed plans to invest €100m in new logistics facilities as it looks to ensure it can meet future demand. The investments include a building of no less than 50,000 sq m on the west side of Brucargo – the hub's cargo area – with direct apron connection for four different companies. Forwarder Kuehne + Nagel and ground handlers Dnata and WFS will be among the companies making use of these buildings for shipping, packaging and temporarily stocking cargo. "The new infrastructure is also specifically suited for the handling of high-quality and temperature-sensitive products, such as pharmaceuticals," the airport said. The airport will also redevelop existing handling buildings that have direct access to the tarmac. Over the next three years, the building in which handling agent Swissport is active will be modernised and have a surface area of 30,000 sq m. An additional new building will provide a secured area for the specific transport of extremely valuable goods. Brinks will be moving into this building in 2019. Part of the investment will go to an exclusive animal border inspection area of more than 2,500 sq m,  fitted out in various temperature and/or light areas to create the perfect environment for all types of animals. Brussels Airport Company chief executive Arnaud Feist said: "These investments are of huge importance for the logistics landscape in Belgium and are entirely in line with our Strategic Vision for 2040. "With these investments, Brussels Airport will remain in the future a crucial hub for air transport and the logistic chains in Europe, at the service of many hundreds of companies in our country. "It is also a strategic objective to offer more and in particularly even better support to the many companies who work through air cargo transport and enabling them to more easily import and export their goods from and to the whole world. This not only ensures employment at the airport itself, but also in various other sectors in all parts of the country." More than a hundred different players in the logistics chain are currently active at Brucargo. In recent years (between 2009 and 2013), three large air cargo buildings have been developed and most recently  DHL Express opened a 31,500 sq m sorting centre at the airport. Last year, cargo demand at the airport increased by 8.3% to 535,634 tons, its highest volumes in the last ten years. Read more air cargo airport news</p>

      <p>The logistics community at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol has launched a closed pharmaceutical chain programme to be International Air Transport Association (IATA) Center of Excellence for Independent Validators certified.</p>
      <p>It was announced at the IATA World Cargo Symposium on 16 March in press conference held in the Tegel room of the Intercontinental Hotel in Berlin, with representatives from the airport and other companies recruited for the programme. The chain has been branded 'Pharma Gateway Amsterdam – Qualified &amp; Transparent' and it aims to support a certified track from the shipper to the consignee, involving airlines, handlers, hauliers and logistics service providers.</p>
      <p>Air Cargo Netherlands director of special programs, Ferry van der Ent says: "Pharma Gateway Amsterdam goes well beyond a simple marketing programme. This new body is tackling the entire proposition of Schiphol Airport for pharma manufacturers, and is commercially neutral. We'll provide a transparent and qualified process, which can be fully monitored."</p>
      <p>By the time of the unveiling at the IATA WCS, WFS, Dnata, Swissport, Air France KLM Martinair Cargo, De Jong Special Services, DJ Middelkoop &amp; Zn., Jan de Rijk Logistics, IJS Global/GEFCO, VCK Logistics, Yusen Logistics and Cyberfreight had been recruited, with more expected to join in the near future.</p>
      <p>Schiphol believes Pharma Gateway Amsterdam will achieve its potential helped by supportive Customs, state-of-the-art facilities, mainport network and technical innovations such as real time temperature measurement. In future, the gateway will include real time monitoring on the ramp on a collective basis, similar to the airport's 'Milkrun' transport collaboration.</p>
      <p>Van der Ent continues: "We have adopted CEIV as our base, as it's the only truly worldwide standard today. Slowly but surely, more logistics partners are choosing CEIV, driven by shipper demand. And, although it's not mandatory yet, it may be in the future. We cannot rule out the adoption of even higher standards in due course."</p>

      <p>AirBridgeCargo (ABC) Airlines has signed a service level agreement with Sky Fresh to adopt digital procedures for transporting time and temperature sensitive shipments.</p>
      <p>The main point of the cooperation is related to cargo acceptance checklists, to replace the traditionally paper-based systems that were filled in manually in the course of the transportation process.</p>
      <p>Sky Fresh provides an online web platform to centralise data from all acceptance checklists, with the possibility of monitoring freight movements for time and temperature sensitive shipments at each step of the transportation and sending automated notifications to all supply chain stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Users will be able to complete the checklists via a mobile application on their smartphone or tablet, available either on App Store or Google Play, with all corresponding real-time data is visible on the Sky Fresh Web platform, accessible in any browser.</p>
      <p>ABC global director of pharma, Fedor Novikov says: "We foresee it propelling the quality of our abcPharma product, bringing it to the next level by eliminating the potential of human error. With environmental considerations high on the agenda of our company, we will contribute by decreasing the number of paper documents and using digitalisation instead."</p>
      <p>"It will definitely make the whole process of transportation more transparent, customised and accurate."</p>
      <p>Sky Fresh business development manager, Fen Lasseel says: "For the first time, Sky Fresh® will closely cooperate with ABC. Together, we want to create a digital mindset in the air freight industry, not only through efficiency gains but also by providing real-time data to support strategic decisions and proof of the excellence of ABC."</p>
      <p>ABC and Sky Fresh say the agreement has "countless benefits" offering a high level of customisation, transparency of operations, traceability, efficiency and the possibility to take corrective and preventive action if needed.</p>
      <p>ABC recorded its highest-ever growth in the volumes of pharmaceuticals carried, rising 153 per cent in the first 10 months of 2017.</p>
      <p>The airline achieved IATA CEIV Pharma certification at the end of 2016, Envirotainer QEP accreditation for certain online stations in 2017, and is training a pool of home-grown specialists in time and temperature sensitive cargo solutions.</p>

      <p>London Heathrow-headquartered aerospace logistics provider B&amp;H Worldwide has named Reg Echeumuna as its new vice president – Americas. He will be based in the company's Miami facility. "The appeal of this role is the opportunity to play a direct lead in further building up the US operation of such a strong niche operator," Echeumuna enthused. "I will be working closely with our teams in Miami and Los Angeles to both develop new business and grow our existing key accounts in the aerospace market." He continued: "We have a unique service offering in the US with the full set of LLP (limited liability partnership) services we are able to deliver to our customers. Control Tower, end-to-end financial and KPI (key performance indicator) performance monitoring combined with customised management and all supported by our OnTrack IT system; that sets us apart from other companies." Senior regional director, Doug Coull, to whom Echeumuna reports, observed that his new charge's "ideas and management skills will be a great asset as we target the business of Tier 1 and 2 airlines, budget airlines and SME MROs (small and medium-sized enterprise maintenance, repair and overhaul companies) alongside the major aircraft parts suppliers we have already been successfully working with for many years".</p>

      <p>Once unheard of in Asia, the CEIV-Pharmaceutical certification program is starting to establish beachheads, first in Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS), then at Changi Airport. Now DHL Global Forwarding's airfreight station in Shanghai has joined the CEIV-certified ranks.</p>
      <p>The 1,650-square-meter Shanghai facility features 245 square meters of space for air-export temperature-sensitive storage. The facility is part of DHL's "answer to the regulatory demands of the pharmaceutical industry," said David Bang, global head of DHL Temperature Management Solutions and CEO LifeConEx at DHL Global Forwarding.</p>
      <p>DHL began CEIV certification for its global stations in the third quarter of 2016.</p>
      <p>Following independent audits by third parties and on-site training, the DHL Air Thermonet station in Shanghai received certification. The integrator says this improved its "transportation and storage quality levels of pharmaceutical goods."</p>
      <p>"The life sciences and healthcare industry increasingly requires more regulatory control over the years, including the transportation and storage of highly sensitive pharmaceutical goods," said Steve Huang, CEO, DHL Global Forwarding Greater China.</p>
      <p>In addition, temperature sensitive airfreight shipments at the Shanghai facility have the option of a door-to-door courier solution, called "Life Sciences graded Specialty Courier." Additionally, DHL offers the express service "Medical Express," with a fixed delivery time, and "DHL Clinical Trial Logistics," a logistics solution specifically designed for clinical studies, such as the transportation of trial medications, auxiliary materials and lab kits.</p>

      <p>LUG aircargo handling has increased the capacity of its Health Care Center (HCC) to 650 square metres as it undergoes IATA CEIV Pharma certification.</p>
      <p>Eight rooms of different sizes are available offering storage at temperatures ranging from -18C and 2-8C to 15-25C, with adjustable temperature settings depending on requirements and volumes. A further expansion of the facility to 1,200 square metres is also possible.</p>
      <p>LUG is undergoing the International Air Transport Association Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics program, to further enhance existing processes and independent auditors verify the handling quality.</p>
      <p>Staff training complements the investments in infrastructure, technical equipment and processes, and LUG should be certified by the end of the first quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>LUG aircargo handling chief executive officer, Patrik Tschirch says: "We are undertaking considerable investments in the area of temperature sensitive cargo handling with the expansion and modernisation of the HCC."</p>
      <p>"We are thus adapting our facilities to our new client structure. From October, we have Emirates SkyCargo in our customer portfolio, an airline with a relatively high share of life science and health care shipments ex Frankfurt/Main."</p>
      <p>Dominik Misskampf was hired on 1 July 2017 as senior project manager to handle the expansion project, and will look after enhancing processes and their adaptation to the new infrastructure, as well as the IATA certification.</p>
      <p>He was previously responsible for various supply chain optimisation projects at Ground Handling Services Fraport, and he is also the head of the Competence Team Pharma of the Air Cargo Community Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Misskampf says he has gained a very good impression of the daily operations and capabilities of the staff at LUG, saying: "I am delighted to be part of the LUG team and to make a contribution to the expansion of the HCC. The project is an important step to increase the performance of the company and to safeguard and strengthen its competitiveness."</p>

      <p>European airline Lufthansa Cargo selects Quintiq, a Dassault Systèmes company and global leader in supply chain planning and optimisation (SCP&amp;O), to improve its production planning at two of its most relevant hubs in Frankfurt and Munich.</p>
      <p>At the two hubs selected for this Quintiq implementation, cargo needs to be broken down and built up for delivery to its next destination, either by plane or truck. With the help of Quintiq, Lufthansa Cargo will be able to make smarter decisions with regards to schedules and workstation locations for these breakdown and build-up activities.</p>
      <p>Additional stations will be included in the future in Lufthansa Cargo's effort to set up a global supply chain system.</p>
      <p>By providing the company with better visibility of inbound and outbound freight handling, the solution eliminates the need for long buffer time when reserving a workstation. The company can free up its workstation capacity, limit required space for storage and increase overall due date reliability for its customers.</p>
      <p>"We at Lufthansa Cargo are constantly looking for new ways to simplify operations and increase efficiency. Digitisation is key. It adds to our competitive advantage and gives value to our partners. Our search for digitised processes led us to Quintiq," said Soren Stark, chief operating officer at Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>"The Quintiq team impressed us with their experience and ability to find simple solutions for our complex challenges. They were able to translate them into a powerful software solution that will improve our cargo handling operations and resource usage," said Tim Heppenheimer, head of Supply Chain Management, Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>The Quintiq solution is able to generate a production plan seven days in advance, based on forecasted orders. Closer to the day of operations, the solution will start to fill the plan with actual orders. Using rapid optimisation technology, it will manage even last-minute updates, as full information on orders may arrive just hours before the goods are scheduled for delivery. The solution will also seamlessly integrate with Lufthansa Cargo's iCargo and Forecast systems. The three-way feedback loop between Forecast, Quintiq and iCargo drives more accurate plans on breakdown and build-up activities, and enables iCargo to monitor on-ground progress.</p>
      <p>"Given its massive volume of production, the increased efficiency of breaking down and building up the cargo will make a great difference to its overall business performance," said Rob van Egmond, CEO at Quintiq.</p>
      <p>"Our presence in the aviation industry is further strengthened by our expansion into the air cargo sector."</p>

      <p>Last week Swiss forwarder and global logistics company Kuehne + Nagel (K+N) threw its hat into the ring of emerging supply chain digitization platforms, launching its own end-to-end supply chain management service, KN ESP.</p>
      <p>The modular platform connects previously disjointed supply chain partners, enabling seamless communication between global shippers their vendors, buyers and sellers while also providing direct access to Kuehne + Nagel's physical assets and experts.</p>
      <p>Through visualization of a customer's end-to-end supply chain, K+N is betting that improvements can be made to increase supplier reliability and product availability.  In addition, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence help customers to optimize orders and prioritize transportation decisions tailored to the customer's individual business.</p>
      <p>The product aims to "eliminate communication frictions no matter how many systems or players are involved," says Otto Schacht, member of the managing board of K+N, addressing a comprehensive list of issues, which include sourcing, quality control, purchase order negotiation, commercial invoice release, buyer's consolidation, transportation and delivery.</p>

      <p>UPS has partnered with HerdX, Inc., a leading US-based agri-tech solutions provider, to deliver blockchain-verified traced beef from a US farm to Japan. The delivery is an important step in the right direction towards quality assurance and traceability in the beef industry.</p>
      <p>The market for track-and-trace and verification tools has increased greatly as consumers demand more information on the food they consume. While stakeholders in the supply chain are looking to standardize the process, there are no global standards that exist.</p>
      <p>The collaboration between UPS and HerdX aims to develop track-and-trace technology that improves quality assurance for beef products being shipped internationally. UPS has created a customised, integrated visibility tool that plugs into HerdX's blockchain technology, to provide live updates and data points throughout the journey.</p>
      <p>"Blockchain verification for international air freight shipments is complex and requires a great amount of expertise in customs and freight forwarding. Getting it right has implications for many industries, such as restaurants, food and beverage, and retail," said Romaine Seguin, president of UPS Global Freight Forwarding. "We're committed to upholding HerdX's industry-leading quality assurance and traceability standards for all customers eyeing international growth moving forward."</p>
      <p>The beef shipment made its way from Kansas wrapped in UPS Temperature True packaging, a cold chain thermal management solution that features temperature-sensitive air freight containers. The packaging contained sensors that monitored and recorded the shipment's temperature from origin to destination. Data sourced via UPS Temperature True monitoring devices was uploaded and integrated seamlessly within HerdX's blockchain verification platform. UPS develops customized, integrated visibility tool for tracking and quality assurance.</p>
      <p>"It's an exciting time to be entering the Japanese market with a much-needed, innovative solution to a pervasive industry issue," Seguin added. "We hope our relationship with HerdX will catalyse an expansion of service offerings for our international shipping customers."</p>

      <p>GTR (Ground Team Red), a joint venture between AirAsia and SATS has launched its air cargo hub at the KLIA Air Cargo Terminal 1 (KACT1). Located at the former low-cost carrier terminal in Sepang, the facility spans 9,300 sq m and was built at a cost of MYR 23 million. It adds additional storage to the existing 4,000 sq m warehouse and the combined facilities will handle 300,000 tonnes of air freight annually, strengthening Malaysia's goal of being a regional logistic hub.</p>
      <p>The new air cargo hub enables GTR to expand its capabilities by handling both narrow and wide-body aircraft cargo operations and has motorised material handling system that facilitates efficient handling of Unit Load Devices. The new air cargo hub also has a purpose-built 1,000 sq m cold-chain facility for specialised handling for perishable and pharmaceutical products and dedicated zones for dangerous goods, pets and valuable cargo handling. Modern security cargo scanners offer both horizontal and vertical views of cargo to enhance detection.</p>
      <p>The Minister of Transport YB Loke Siew Fook, along with CEO of AirAsia Group Tony Fernandes, AirAsia Group President (Airlines) Bo Lingam, SATS President and CEO Alex Hungate, GTR CEO Kevin Chin, AirAsia Malaysia CEO Riad Asmat and Teleport CEO Pete Chareonwongsak officiated the opening of the new GTR air cargo hub.</p>
      <p>Minister of transport YB Loke Siew Fook said: "I would like to congratulate GTR on the launch of their Air Cargo hub today, and their efforts to enhance airline ground handling operations in Malaysia. It is an impressive facility and will help to further elevate KLIA and klia2 as a key logistics gateway, in line with my Ministry's National Logistics Masterplan to develop Malaysia as a logistics hub. I would also like to see GTR replicate this facility, in particular their cold-room capabilities to other airports in Malaysia to add further value to our ambition of developing Malaysia as a logistics hub."</p>
      <p>Ground Team Red CEO Kevin Chin said: "We expect KLIA's air cargo to grow steadily. With global eCommerce players investing in the region, the increased capacity and digitalisation will enhance air cargo handling services. We will continue our efforts to strengthen Malaysia's position to become a world class logistics hub in the region by adding capabilities in other parts of Malaysia."</p>

      <p>AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) has completed a multi-modal shipment trial for DHL Global Forwarding to deliver healthcare products from Moscow to Miami using an RKN active cargo container in accordance with Good Distribution Practice (GDP) cool chain standards.</p>
      <p>For the trial, ABC's pharma logistics practitioners opted the abcPharma product using an Envirotainer RKN unit, replacing real vaccines with service water in order to test the delivery process at each step of the transportation and monitor the condition of the water.</p>
      <p>Together with DHL Global Forwarding Russia, they supplied the RKN unit to the customer's warehouse and accepted the cargo as a fully built-up unit ready for carriage at its airport warehouse premises, with the teams covering delivery, leasing and guaranteed customs clearance for the customer as well as ensuring a minimum transit time and the elimination of temperature risk.</p>
      <p>On 24 November the trial shipment took off on one of ABC's Boeing 747 Freighters from Moscow on its direct route to Chicago, where it was met by local ABC representatives, who monitored the offloading and ensured the smooth transportation onto a refrigerated truck to take the 'vaccines' to Miami.</p>
      <p>From Miami, the RKN continued on its journey to Managua, the capital of Nicaragua with another carrier, and though the special container can run on battery power for more than 90 hours and sustain the required temperature range, it was decided to maintain +50C inside the ruck to introduce a second safety measure.</p>
      <p>ABC global director for pharma, Fedor Novikov says: "We are proud to be been given this opportunity to demonstrate the quality of the pharma solutions we can provide and to have earned the trust of our customer for the organisation of vaccines transportation."</p>
      <p>"With ABC only developing temperature-sensitive solutions for less than a year, it is a huge achievement to be chosen to provide dedicated lift of healthcare products, which will improve the quality of life for people of the Republic of Nicaragua when we commence the delivery of vaccines in 2018."</p>
      <p>The RKN is a certified air cargo ULD container which ensures the integrity of pharma products by maintaining product temperatures in either +2-8C range, in the controlled room temperature range of +15-25C, or at any chosen set temperature within the operating range of 0-20C.</p>
      <p>ABC gained IATA CEIV Pharma certification in 2016 and has since developed special benefits for pharma customers including the Sky Fresh web platform.</p>
      <p>The airline gained Envirotainer QEP accreditation at its global hub at Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport and in Dallas, with the online stations of Milan, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Los Angeles and Chicago following within two months.</p>

      <p>ABU DHABI, UAE–During a CEIV Pharma workshop held at IATA's 11th annual World Cargo Symposium, speakers praised the air cargo industry for rapidly improving the reliability of the pharma supply-chain; but still, with more than US$34.1 billion in annual losses due to temperature excursions, and with allegations that nearly 25 percent of vaccines reaching their final destination in a "degraded condition," the industry has a long way to go (for more on CEIV progress, see our coverage yesterday, CEIV stakeholders must be frank about their limitations). Today at the Symposium however, there were clear signs the wakeup call has been received. A new initiative launched by Amsterdam Airport Schiphol to develop an early warning system for pharma shippers for one, promises to further reduce temperature excursions within the air pharma supply chain.</p>
      <p>Beginning later this month, stakeholders at the airport, including Air France-KLM Cargo, Cargonaut and Schiphol's 13-member pharma community, Pharma Gateway Amsterdam (PGA), will work together to improve data collection and temperature monitoring for pharma shipments moving through Schiphol. Jonas van Stekelenburg, cargo director at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol said, "Pharma shippers are asking for more visibility so they can have confidence that their sensitive cargo is being handled safely through the supply chain and find solutions if there are issues such as temperature excursions. This research will enable us to develop a system capable of stepping up to those challenges."</p>
      <p>Ultimately the program aims to develop a cloud-based application that notifies shippers directly if the temperature data collected does not align with the requirements of any given consignment.</p>
      <p>Sebastiaan Scholte, CEO of Jan de Rijk Logistics, a member of PGA, said the initiative was "excellent", adding: "We hope that many other air cargo supply chain communities will follow this example and work together, because this is how the whole industry will improve."</p>
      <p>Marcel de Nooijer, EVP of Air France KLM Cargo, said, "We are keen to improve the supply chain in collaboration with other parties in the chain, contributing to overall higher product integrity for pharmaceutical shipments."</p>
      <p>Development of the early warning system will be funded through a €1 million subsidy that was awarded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), and TKI Dinalog (the Dutch Institute for Advanced Logistics). Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and Delft University of Technology will do the underlying research for the project, while stakeholders at Schiphol Cargo will contribute to performance management and alerting capabilities.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in learning more about the air freight cold chain, join us at Cargo Facts Asia in Shanghai, 25 – 26 April, where Sebastiaan Scholte, CEO of Jan de Rijk Logistics and Chairman of The Cool Chain Association, will take part in a session devoted to shipment of perishables. To register, or for more information, go to CargoFactsAsia.com</p>

      <p>The Cool Chain Association (CCA) will host its Fifth Global Perishables Event at Europe's largest fresh and food hub at Venlo, the Netherlands, on the May 14 and 15, 2019.</p>
      <p>The two-day event focuses on how the airfreight supply chain can help reduce food loss.</p>
      <p>Waste-to-energy solutions, the importance of standards in the cool chain, and collaboration with blockchain, are just some of the topics to be debated at the event, which will also include a tour of the Fresh Park Venlo facilities.</p>
      <p>CCA recently announced the launch of a pilot data sharing initiative to monitor shipments of commodities such as avocados and berries on trade lanes from Latin America to Europe and from the USA to the Middle East.</p>
      <p>The data will be analysed by Food Waste Prevention Consultant and CCA Researcher Philippe Schuler, who will present preliminary results on the first day of the CCA event next month.</p>
      <p>Stavros Evangelakakis, chairman of the Cool Chain Association and Global Product manager Healthcare and Perishables, Cargolux said: "With a third of the world's food going to waste it is important that, from grower to consumer, we all contribute to taking action.</p>
      <p>"Our perishables event will provide a networking platform for change as well as an opportunity for delegates to see first-hand Europe's largest fresh hub in operation."</p>
      <p>Speakers at the event will also include the International Air Transport Association (IATA)'s Andrea Gruber, head, Special Cargo, who will present IATA's new Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Fresh Programme, aimed at perishable supply chain stakeholders.</p>
      <p>CCA Board member Vijan Chetty, general manager, Coastal, Perishable Products Export Control Board (PPECB), South Africa will discuss the importance of standards, with Philippe Julien, Digital Innovation director at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo looking at how blockchain can help with collaborative workflows.</p>
      <p>Day two of the event will include a Venlo site visit, as well as a presentation on what happens with food once it is waste, introduced by Saskia Louwen Prez Project Manager for Waste-to-Energy Projects at ARCHEA New Energy GmbH and a talk on insurance and certification in the cool food chain by Wolfgang Engel, Head of Competence Sector Logistics at DSQ inc.</p>
      <p>The 130 hectare Fresh Park Venlo is home to over 100 companies involved directly or indirectly in the business of fresh produce or food, including wholesalers, processing companies, logistics providers, and packing companies.</p>
      <p>"Venlo is a strategic location, with four modal connections, including road, rail, barge, and air between the mainports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, a food production area, and close to the German and European Union markets," said Jan Vorstermans, Business Development, Fresh Park Venlo.</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo has become the Middle East's first carrier to be awarded IATA's Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) certification for pharmaceutical Logistics. The airline is one of only 16 carriers worldwide to hold CEIV Pharma certification, a regime which demonstrates an airline's ability to manage high-value, temperature-sensitive shipments for the pharma and life sciences industries. The certifications cover both the airline operations of Etihad Cargo, as well as cargo handling and warehousing at its hub in Abu Dhabi International Airport, Abdulla Mohamed Shadid, managing director cargo and logistics at Etihad Aviation Group, said: "Etihad Cargo is honoured to become the region's first carrier to be awarded IATA's CEIV designation for Pharma. "Since we launched our refreshed strategy in early 2018, a lot of focus has gone towards enhancing our premium product verticals and offering the highest quality and reliability standards to our customers. Today our TempCheck product receives a major boost with this important certification." Etihad's cargo handling subsidiary Etihad Airport Services has also been awarded the CEIV Pharma certification. Said a spokesperson for the airline: "Etihad has undergone a major enhancement programme to its facilities, systems and processes to meet the stringent standards that CEIV Pharma demands, which combines IATA's Temperature Control Regulations, GDP best practices, and other international benchmarks. "These enhancements include the planned use of cool dollies at Abu Dhabi International Airport, thermal blankets both in Abu Dhabi and at key stations globally, and a tie up with additional active container suppliers to expand the options of temperature-controlled containers across its global network, among other initiatives. Etihad also commenced a major expansion and refurbishment program to its cargo terminal at Abu Dhabi in the fourth quarter of 2018 which aims to add additional temperature-controlled space to its existing pharma zone by 2020. This was in addition to a dedicated staging facility at its Midfield complex in time for the airline's move to the new  terminal.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) is the first cargo terminal operator (CTO) in the world to complete a pilot for IATA's new Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit (SFOC).</p>
      <p>SFOC is part of the Smart Facility programme which aims to provide total transparency on capacities and services offered by CTOs, by means of a multi-tiered validation process. This could save thousands of man-hours every year taken up with largely duplicated auditing effort.</p>
      <p>The cargo handler was chosen as the launch test site for the new audit system because of the scale and complexity of its operations, the diverse range of cargo it handles, the number of carriers (over 100) it serves, and the company's highly-developed quality management systems.</p>
      <p>"The feedback received from the Hactl team was valuable in fine-tuning the audit questions, auditor actions and guidance ensuring a consistently high audit quality across the programme," says Glyn Hughes, IATA's Global head of Cargo.</p>
      <p>SFOC targets a reduction in complexity and number of current industry audits, by adopting all IATA standards relating to cargo terminal operations.</p>
      <p>"Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit reports will enable carriers to complement their risk analysis data, and conduct more focused on-site audits that are shorter, less resource-intensive and less frequent," explains Hughes.</p>
      <p>Initially the programme aims to reduce carrier audit complexity by 50 percent, reducing the burden on cargo terminal operators.</p>
      <p>The Smart Facility programme will encompass remote validation of handling facilities' infrastructure and equipment, supplemented by the SFOC on-site audit. The programme will provide a central register of all participating handlers' physical resources and capabilities, and will also confirm that all validated handling agents comply with IATA's Cargo Handling Manual (ICHM), a uniform set of standards and criteria covering all aspects of their operations.</p>
      <p>"The IATA Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit will provide assurance to the air cargo industry that the published infrastructure, equipment and operating procedure information is complete and accurate," says Marc Voelkl, IATA's Project manager - Smart Facility.</p>
      <p>"Having validated capacity information of Cargo Terminal Operators publicly available will facilitate better matchmaking between carriers and handlers, and assist in network planning and development, catering precisely to the shippers' needs."</p>
      <p>The SFOC Audit shares some content with IATA's ISAGO Cargo and Mail (CGM) discipline; an SFOC- accredited CTO will therefore be automatically validated for the CGM discipline. The SFOC Audit will be offered as a stand-alone audit, or in conjunction with ISAGO (refresher) audits, to further reduce accreditation costs and duration of audits.</p>
      <p>Tan Chee Hong, chief operating officer, Hactl adds: "The Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit will provide a simple, public register of all handler's facilities and capabilities, supported by benchmarking against universally accepted industry standards. This can only result in the spread of best practice, and competition based on quality rather than price."</p>
      <p>"We must all eradicate any weak links in air cargo supply chains, for the collective good of the industry - and this is a very effective move towards that goal."</p>
      <p>Further SFOC pilot audits are to be conducted at handling locations in London, Luxembourg, Singapore, Amsterdam and Dubai throughout the remainder of 2018. Alongside these pilots, IATA will continue development of the Smart Facility Standards Manual and the Smart Facility Auditor Training programme.</p>

      <p>CEVA Logistics has added a new 15,000 sq ft temperature control facility at its airport industrial park warehouse. The new building has been constructed as an insulated building-within-a-building on the city's airport industrial park and will allow the forwarder to "better serve customers with medical products requiring to be kept within a constant temperature range of 15-25 degrees Celsius".  CEVA managing director Ireland Gary O'Connor said: "Temperature controlled logistics are an increasingly important part of the Irish export market as life sciences manufacturing continues to grow in the country. "This new addition to our service offering will enable us to store up to 2,100 pallets of medical products within the 15-25 degree temperature range and cater for growing numbers of customer enquiries where temperature-controlled storage is an essential part of their business." The new Dublin unit also features state-of-the-art air conditioning, heating and cooling technology complete with a Sintra system which provides exceptional levels of clean air by using perforated ducts to diffuse the air within the facility. Having specialist clean room facilities, CEVA can also offer customers additional value-added services including re-kitting and reassembling in a controlled environment. The facility enables CEVA to provide customers with a 24/7 service for any goods moving through the unit as it is now fully authorized under the HPRA (Health Products Regulatory Authority) Wholesalers Distribution Authorization scheme. In order to receive an authorisation to wholesale medicinal products, a potential authorisation/licence holder must show compliance with the principle of Good Distribution Practice (GDP). </p>
      <p> The next stage of the facility's development, which now caters to multiple healthcare customers, will be the introduction of on-site pharmacists, which will commence by the end of 2017. Read more pharma logistics news</p>

      <p>German supply chain company Fiege has shortlisted ten start-ups for the Logistics Tech Accelerator 2017 programme. Fiege, partnering with San Francisco's RocketSpace technology campus and Spain's Kaleido, is a corporate collaborator to the Accelerator programme. The scheme, in which Lufthansa Cargo is also a corporate partner, helps identify and select young technology companies to help bring their ideas and visions of the future to life by matching them with companies willing to invest or provide help. Andreas Pott, director corporate development at Fiege, said: "We held many talks with interesting start-ups. The ideas revolved mainly around the digitisation and automation of all conceivable supply chain processes. "We can already say that we want to intensively pursue and accompany a few of the really exciting ideas presented."  Over a period of four months, the chosen start-ups will have the opportunity to advance and develop their respective business idea with the help of the logistics partners. "We support the start-ups and share our expertise with them", said executive board member, Felix Fiege, adding: "Also, we will be implementing some ideas as pilot projects and hope this will mature into a business model that we will want to participate in." The ten chosen start-ups originate from seven different countries, ranging from India, Europe and the US. With Mycargorates from Cologne and Sennder from Berlin, two German start-ups have been added to the Accelerator's international line-up. Mycargorates has developed an online-based transport management system and booking portal for logistics, while Sennder offers solutions for same-day or 12-hour delivery services. </p>

      <p>United Airlines and Lufthansa Cargo have launched their air cargo joint venture with the two airlines jointly managing sales and bookings from 3 May.</p>
      <p>Starting on selected routed from the USA, Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany, the carriers are now jointly managing sales and bookings of standard and express shipments.</p>
      <p>They will expand the geographical scope in the coming months and plan to include additional products and features in the future.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo chairman and chief executive officer, Peter Gerber says the joint venture will provide enhanced value to customers, saying: "The combination of the two strong networks offers new routing options. The co-location of our warehouses, in Munich for example, is an additional benefit, with customers needing only one location for export drop-off and import delivery.</p>
      <p>"Aligned processes and quicker transfers between separate warehouses also lead to streamlined transport times."</p>
      <p>United Cargo president, Jan Krems adds: "Through our joint venture, United and Lufthansa Cargo offer transatlantic shippers more options that produce these benefits – including increased frequencies on a combined network accessible through either partner's booking channels. Our aligned teams and processes also deliver the superior service quality essential to our customers' success."</p>

      <p>Forwarders at Brussels Airport enjoyed faster pick-up and delivery yesterday, following the introduction of the airport's slot booking app.</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding was the first to book on Monday, with Nippon Express, Kuehne + Nagel, Panalpina and Skyfast also taking advantage of the new process.</p>
      <p>More than 300 slots have now been booked over the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>The app allows forwarders to book times for pick-up and delivery at two handling warehouses, those of Aviapartner and WFS. On approval by the handler, they can go to the reserved gate at the specified time instead of having to queue, cutting wait times.</p>
      <p>Until yesterday, all information was exchanged manually, via email or phone. This resulted in peak and idle periods for ground handlers, waiting times for forwarders, a lack of transparency and inefficient personnel planning, according to the BRUCargo community. The new app matches a slot request with available capacity and aligns supply and demand.</p>
      <p>"The first feedback was very positive and no major issues have been reported," said Sara Van Gelder, cargo and logistics development manager for Brussels Airport.</p>
      <p>"We have no objective calculation about the reduction of the waiting times, since before [the app] no data was collected and shared on waiting times. We can clearly say though, based on the feedback from the forwarders, that yesterday they could get immediate access to the reserved gates and so eliminate waiting times almost completely."</p>
      <p>The app will develop in three phases, with all local deliveries from forwarders located at BRU first.</p>
      <p>"We want to broaden the scope of the app to include deliveries originating from outside BRUcargo. The more forwarders get involved, the more capacity the ground handlers will make available," added Ms Van Gelder.</p>
      <p>The slot booking app marks the first step towards digitising landside management at the airport. The community has plans for several more, including truck status, traffic guidance, freight management and driver database.</p>
      <p>"A combination of applications will make it possible to have a smooth and paperless 'green lane' for the delivery and pick-up of freight," said Ms Van Gelder.</p>

      <p>Unilode Aviation Solutions and OnAsset Intelligence have launched the world's first aviation-compliant Bluetooth roaming network.</p>
      <p>This development follows in the path of a variety of digitally-enabled services recently brought to market by Unilode. In the process of building the world's largest fleet of connected aviation containers and pallets, Unilode has been rapidly rolling out a global infrastructure of readers at key airports using OnAsset's SENTRY 500 FlightSafe device, a fully aviation-compliant and airline-approved Bluetooth 5 reader. These readers capture data from multi-sensor digital tags, continuously collecting location, temperature, humidity, motion, shock and light data to provide powerful insights into the status of Unilode's digitally-enabled fleet and its customers' cargo and passengers' baggage. Augmented by a mobile app that allows any iOS or Android device to become part of the reader network, Unilode has created a powerful, flexible and standards-based network that the company is now opening for the benefit of all stakeholders in the aviation value chain.</p>
      <p>Serving the aviation industry is particularly challenging due to the highly regulated and fast-paced nature of the business. With compliance and safety always being key concerns, it requires more than just a network. As part of the service, not only is access to the network provided, but a full suite of services to validate and onboard new devices are included. Ensuring the security, integrity and compliance pedigree of the network are foundational considerations and ease of business is also a core focus, so Managed Interoperability bundles all the facets of integration together. Including a thorough review of regulatory compliance, security, encryption, authentication, messaging protocols and device performance, Managed Interoperability covers the integration process from A to Z as part of the service.</p>
      <p>Benoît Dumont, CEO, Unilode said, "Customers have been asking for interoperability in the network for some time. We are happy to offer access to our reader infrastructure to anyone who has a Bluetooth® tag that meets the extremely high standards of the aviation industry and supports best-in-class security and encryption. We won't let just any device on our network. There are a lot of inferior products on the market and we want customers to know that they can trust and rely on data provided by Unilode – this is why we are bringing a more comprehensive solution with Managed Interoperability™ to the market."</p>
      <p>Adam Crossno, CEO, OnAsset Intelligence said, "OnAsset is pleased to support Unilode in taking this next big step in digital evolution. We know the market likes choices, and we know that Unilode's customers demand the best, so we are excited to help realise this vision for the world's largest interoperable Bluetooth network. Innovation like this isn't easy, especially in the aviation industry, so we are focused on doing it right. We are using all our expertise and experience to help Unilode set the gold standard in delivering these new services."</p>

      <p>Cargo handling company Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) is investing €10 million, including equipment and supplies for the next 10 years, in new pharma centre, at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.</p>
      <p>The 2,400 m² pharma centre, located in the heart of CDG airport's cargo area, is opening in September and will be offering both landside and airside acceptance capabilities.</p>
      <p>It will also become IATA CEIV Pharma certified, as part of an initiative launched by Group ADP within the cargo community at Paris-CDG Airport.</p>
      <p>The facility has its own docks and manoeuvring area for the loading and unloading of temperature-controlled pharmaceutical shipments.</p>
      <p>In order to ensure constant tracking of shipments from the centre to and from aircraft, a new warehouse management system (WMS) has been implemented. This will support the use of barcode scanning for real-time storage capacity monitoring and management.</p>
      <p>A statement from WFS informed: "A temperature monitoring solution with a cloud platform will collect temperature and humidity data in real-time via sensors and enable this information to be accessed on mobile devices."</p>
      <p>Setting straight ground handling priorities</p>
      <p>WFS is also investing in new digital technology systems to improve operational efficiency and shipment visibility.</p>
      <p>As part of WFS' global safety and security programme, the controlled-access pharma centre is also equipped with modern screening, CCTV control and alarm systems, monitored 24/7 by its Security operational centre.</p>
      <p>The WFS pharma centre will adopt a Quality Management System with specific processes for temperature-controlled cargoes. Performance will be measured against pre-set Key Performance Indicators during management reviews and internal audits.</p>
      <p>Ensuring flexibility to adjust capacity on demand, the WFS Pharma Centre is served by exclusively-designed temperature-controlled three-pallet trailers and cool dollies</p>
      <p>A team of highly trained pharmaceutical handling specialists will operate the centre. The team is IATA CEIV trained and possess a solid knowledge of time and temperature-sensitive healthcare and pharmaceutical products transportation according to IATA's Temperature Control Regulations. They will also receive additional training at WFS' WFS Academy.</p>
      <p>Hugo Rodrigues, vice president Cargo France at WFS commented: "At a major air cargo gateway like Paris CDG, we believe it is incumbent on ground handlers to invest in the right equipment to handle pharma products."</p>
      <p>This latest investment follows the opening of WFS pharma facilities in Copenhagen, Johannesburg and Miami.</p>

      <p>With the recent launch of DHL Global Forwarding's new temperature-controlled logistics center, high-value pharma, medical and life sciences commodities now have an additional option when passing through Amsterdam's Schiphol gateway. The new 1,000-square-meter "Life Science Competence Center," which came at a cost of €1 million, will serve as a hub for the processing, transfer and storage of temperature-sensitive commodities handled within the company's Thermonet network.</p>
      <p>Like many similar centers, DHL's new Competence Center at Schiphol contains two separate areas designed to accommodate the specific temperature requirements of the commodities being handled. Both ULDs and pallets enter the facility through a temperature-regulated loading area before moving into one of two highly-controlled areas of the warehouse.</p>
      <p>Pharmaceutical products requiring constant, near-freezing temperatures are handled in a section of the warehouse that maintains a constant temperature, between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius.  Temperatures in the second section of center, in turn, are maintained between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius. Both sections of the warehouse are equipped with temperature and humidity sensors that are actively monitored by the facility's logistics specialists, and emit an alarm at the onset of abnormal temperature conditions.</p>
      <p>The new facility also enables end-to-end tracking and temperature visibility through DHL's "Life Track" IT system. ULDs and pallets moving through the facility come pre-tagged with RFID chips, which automatically upload real-time temperature and geographical data as they move throughout different links along the supply-chain.</p>
      <p>The life sciences and healthcare industry is regulated by increasingly stricter compliance requirements that stretch beyond the historic boundaries of GMP and GSP standards (Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Storage Practice), said Nigel Wing, global head of life sciences and healthcare for DHL-GF. "At the same time, dealing with increasingly sensitive pharmaceutical products, often of high value, that have specific handling and temperature tolerances brings new complexity to the supply chain," he said.</p>

      <p>European cargo hub Schiphol has launched Pharma Gateway Amsterdam (PGA), a  community-based cool chain logistics programme for the niche high value airfreight product. All participants in PGA will be IATA CEIV Pharma-certified and the programme is the initiative of Schiphol's Pharma Task Force, launched in July 2015 by Air Cargo Netherlands, the Dutch Air Cargo Industry Association. In a recent interview, to be published in the April 4 edition, Jonas van Stekelenberg, head of cargo at Schiphol said it is the first time an airport in Europe has created a whole CEIV chain, with  all parties in the handling of a pharma shipment – airlines, forwarders, truckers etc – certified. The CEIV chain will be marketed jointly by all the participants, another first. The announcement by the Dutch hub, the third largest European cargo airport by volumes, was made during the IATA World Cargo Symposium in Berlin. The programme has already recruited WFS, DNATA, Swissport, Air France – KLM – Martinair Cargo, De Jong Special Services, DJ.Middelkoop, Jan de Rijk Logistics, IJS Global/GEFCO, VCK Logistics, Yusen Logistics and Cyberfreight as members. More companies are expected to join in the near future. Branded as "qualified and transparent," PGA's objective is to create a 'closed' pharma chain at the airport, further developing Schiphol's role as one of Europe's largest gateways for pharma traffic. Said a spokesman: "Pharma Gateway Amsterdam aims to support a certified track from the shipper, all the way to the consignee. "It will achieve this locally by involving airlines, handlers, hauliers and logistics service providers – all of which will be certified to the IATA CEIV Pharma standard." For imports, it means covering the unloading of aircraft, ramp transfers, first line handling through the handling agent, transport to the second line forwarder warehouse and any handling carried out there, then haulage to the consignee or distribution centre. "This all-inclusive approach will ensure the integrity of shipments remains intact," added the spokesman. IATA CEIV has been selected as the basis for PGA, as it builds on the storage-centric scope of GDP by covering all air cargo processes, and provides a uniform global set of standards without any scope for localised interpretation, said the airport. Pharma manufacturers will continue to deal direct with their chosen suppliers, but will also be able to contact the neutral Pharma Gateway Amsterdam administration for additional information and a full list of participants. Ferry van der Ent of Air Cargo Netherlands said: "Pharma Gateway Amsterdam goes well beyond a simple marketing programme. This new body is tackling the entire proposition of Schiphol Airport for pharma manufacturers, and is commercially neutral.  We'll provide a transparent and qualified process, which can be fully monitored. "We are targeting quality and transparency by closely linking all service providers, and setting uniform standards and procedures. At the same time, we'll continue to offer shippers and their forwarders a choice of partners in their new, closed supply chain." He continued: "We have adopted CEIV as our base, as it's the only truly worldwide standard today. Slowly but surely, more logistics partners are choosing CEIV, driven by shipper demand. And, although it's not mandatory yet, it may be in the future. We cannot rule out the adoption of even higher standards in due course." Future plans for Pharma Gateway Amsterdam include real time monitoring on the ramp on a collective basis, similar to the airport's current "Milkrun" transport collaboration.</p>

      <p>A customs-to-customs pilot project entitled Smart and Secure Trade Lanes (SSTL) has made progress with the first airfreight shipment to move from China to the EU having successfully landed at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol on an Air China Cargo flight from Shanghai in December. The shipment was booked by Yusen Logistics, one of the participants in the SSTL programme. Yusen Logistics Northern Europe regional managing director Piet Boogaard said the programme will "help reduce lead times and further secure the supply chain". It has already brought down customs clearance times and increased predictability in the maritime supply chain through close cooperation between Customs in countries including China, the Netherlands, Spain, and Poland, Schiphol noted.</p>
      <p>The EU – China Smart and Secure Trade Lanes (SSTL) is a Pilot Project between the EU and China which allows testing end-to-end supply chain security instruments and mechanisms in line with WCO SAFE Framework of Standards. </p>
      <p>Its scope has only extended to airfreight more recently, with the first air freight shipment under the SSTL project having moved from Schiphol to Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou last May. The customs authorities of countries participating in SSTL are working together to recognise and make use of each other's inspection findings, share risk information, and develop secure communication channels for these purposes.</p>
      <p>It aims to reduce lead times and Customs procedures, and increase security in the supply chain through data sharing between Customs.    Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is the only European airport which currently takes part in the SSTL Air pilot project.</p>
      <p>The cooperation is currently between Customs in China, the Netherlands, and several other EU member states.    The scope of the project has now been extended to air transport and more SSTL flight routes are expected to follow between Schiphol and Shanghai Pudong, Baiyun, and Hong Kong.</p>

      <p>Major venues for trade shows and exhibitions are increasingly turning to 3PLs to help them secure contracts with event organisers.</p>
      <p>By teaming up with logistics providers through long-term contracts, venues are able to offer more a greater range of services to event organisers, said David Pegler, chief executive of London's Excel centre this week.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the sidelines of the enormous DSEI arms fair in London, Mr Pegler told The Loadstar the three-year contract ExCel signed with Agility Logistics this year was an integral part of the "value" it offers the conference and exhibition organisers that make up ExCel's customer base.</p>
      <p>"We want this venue to be the venue organisers want to come to, but the facilities themselves are only part of that – having the right partners to help run the site and offer value-added services is crucial.</p>
      <p>"We are really pleased with the relationship we have developed with Agility, because they share the same values as us. Their global network is also very important, but beyond all the services and physical infrastructure, it is about people and they have a very good team," he said.</p>
      <p>Under th three-year contract, Agility's Fairs &amp; Events division has partnered with ExCeL to provide event organisers, exhibitors and contractors with specialist event transport and logistics, pre- and post-show storage, on-site reception and delivery, forklift/mechanical handling equipment and customer logistics advice and support.</p>
      <p>ExCel had put the contract for a freight service provider out to open tender.</p>
      <p>David Richards, managing director for Agility Fairs &amp; Events UK, said the company had relocated around 50 staff to the ExCel site since 2012, allowing it to offer freight services on a non-exclusive basis until the contract was signed in February.</p>
      <p>"This is a true partnership that is unique in the events business in the UK – with the DSEI event alone we have handled about 1,000 tonnes of freight and there are another 16 events to be held here before the end of the year," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Pegler added that ExCel's major competitors were based in Paris, Barcelona and Madrid, and said the events sector was seeing increased competition.</p>
      <p>"Events can move from one location to another, and there is general overcapacity – we have around 100,000sq metres. Places such as Frankfurt and Munich offer 300-400,000sq metres but the really big trade shows of the past are in decline. So there is increased competition for the shows, and venues have to be able to offer a range of services," he said.</p>

      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) will see the global logistics industry shift its operating model from being reactive to being proactive and predictive. Big Data, self-learning systems and the monitoring of social media will enable logistics providers to be better prepared for rapid consumer demand, such as that which saw an estimated 38,000 tonnes of fidget spinners transported by air last year. A joint report by DHL and IBM, Artificial Intelligence in Logistics, has evaluated the potential of AI and shown how it can to transform the logistics industry, giving rise to a "new class of intelligent logistics assets and operational paradigms". While AI is already established in the consumer arena, as demonstrated by the rapid growth of voice assistant applications, DHL and IBM found that AI technologies are "maturing at great pace," allowing for additional applications for the logistics industry. "Today's current technology, business, and societal conditions favour a paradigm shift to proactive and predictive logistics operations more than any previous time in history" explained Matthias Heutger, senior vice president and global head of innovation at DHL. "As the technological progress in the field of AI is proceeding at great pace, we see it as our duty to explore, together with our customers and employees, how AI will shape the logistics industry's future." Many industries have already successfully adopted AI into their everyday business, such as the engineering and manufacturing industry, stated the report. AI is being used in production lines to help streamline production and maintenance through image recognition and "conversational interfaces". The report contends that, with the help of AI, the logistics industry will generate better insights at favourable costs in back office, operational and customer-facing activities". AI technologies can use advanced image recognition to track condition of shipments and assets, bring end-to-end autonomy to transportation, or predict fluctuations in global shipment volumes before they occur. It added: "AI augments human capabilities but also eliminates routine work, which will shift the focus of logistics workforces to more meaningful and value-added work." Keith Dierkx, IBM global industry leader for freight, logistics, and rail, said: "Technology is changing the logistics industry's traditional value chains, and ecosystems are reshaping enterprises, industries and economies. "By leveraging AI into core processes, companies can invest more in strategic growth imperatives to modernize or eliminate legacy application systems. This can make existing assets and infrastructure more efficient, while providing the workforce with time to enhance their skills and capabilities." In the report, DHL and IBM conclude that AI will develop to become as" omnipresent" in the industrial sector as it currently is in the consumer world. "AI stands to transform the logistics industry into a proactive, predictive, automated and personalized branch. Considering this, the report provides perspectives and best practices on how logistics players can seize and adopt AI in their global supply chains." Read more cargo e-commerce logistics news</p>

      <p>Ariaen Zimmerman is the new full time executive director of Cargo 2000 (C2K), an IATA interest group established to lead the drive towards "enhanced quality throughout the air cargo industry".   Zimmerman is leading the group's change programme, which will see C2K adopt a new auditing system, neutral benchmarks, and "embrace a smarter, wider approach to data analysis using smart data".   Said Zimmerman: "This is an exciting time for C2K as we establish the organisation's lead role in creating and implementing quality standards for the global air cargo industry.   "C2K is a truly collaborative platform with a vital role to play in ensuring we improve and demonstrate our commitment to quality for the entire door-to-door logistics chain."   Zimmerman has held senior management roles in the airfreight industry, including at Polar Air Cargo and, most recently, Saudi Airlines Cargo. He takes over from IATA's head of cargo e-business management, Guillaume Drucy, who also acted as C2K executive director on a part time basis.   Zimmerman's C2K team includes Laura Rodriguez, assistant manager, who has been working with IATA's cargo division for two years, Sebastian Schirmers, who joined C2K as operations manager in August from DB Schenker, and Phil Sims, secretary to the board.   A spokesperson said that the creation of a new C2K organisation is part of the change programme initiated in the past months by the C2K board and IATA's cargo management, which also saw the adoption of the Industry Master Operating Plan (MOP) as a recommended practice by IATA's Cargo Services Conference (CSC).   The management team will continue to work closely with its membership board, chaired by Kuehne+Nagel's global head of carrier and gateway air logistics Max Sauberschwarz and with the IATA Cargo standards team. C2K recently held its membership meeting in Abu Dhabi, where it met to network and take part in workshops, including a session on rebranding C2K.   C2K is a global not-for-profit membership group supported by IATA and including airlines, freight forwarders, ground-handling agents, trucking companies, and IT solutions providers. </p>

      <p>At today's sixth annual Bioscience Conference in Brussels, delegates at the Cool Chain Association (CCA) event called for more information-sharing among pharmaceutical stakeholders to build a more secure and efficient supply chain that meets the customized needs of today's patients.</p>
      <p>"There will be a differentiated future – a much broader range of products, a natural split between the very cheap accessible products in the local supermarket and very personal products, which are very high value," said speaker Niels van Namen, UPS' vice president and managing director for healthcare in Europe. "There will be a much broader range of delivery channels. We are already delivering to the patient at home, and that can mean a nurse giving the injection.'</p>
      <p>Namen continued, saying the industry needs to have a physical infrastructure that is "knitted together" to ensure the right products end up with the right patients.</p>
      <p>While the delegates at the event generally described recent advancements in the global temperature control of sensitive cargo was improving, there remains a concern over siloed information. "The chain is not there yet," said pharma logistics expert Yoram Eshel. "We are not good at sharing information," between regulators, pharma agencies and forwarders.</p>
      <p>"My message is do not be afraid to share information," Eshel added. "The pharma industry, together with all logistics stakeholders need to work hand in hand in order to improve product integrity and patient health and safety."</p>
      <p>"As an industry, starting from the shipper all the way to the patient, we should also think about the challenges faced by the people delivering on the last mile through jungles and up mountains," said Cool Chain Association Chairman Stavros Evangelakakis. "There are thousands of preventable deaths of infants under five years old every day and we should be part of the solution."</p>

      <p>Panalpina's healthcare logistics centre near Frankfurt Airport has obtained Good Distribution Practice (GDP) certification, bringing the certified network to 38 locations.</p>
      <p>The Weiterstadt facility is located near the airport as well as close to major highways and Germany's federal road infrastructure, allowing customers to shorten lead times for intra-European and global shipments.</p>
      <p>The facility, Panalpina's third in the Rhein-Main region alongside Moerfelden and Neu-Isenburg, passed an audit by SGS.</p>
      <p>It is equipped for hub services for multimodal transport including last-mile delivery and linked to Panalpina's global network offering temperature-controlled air and ocean freight services.</p>
      <p>In Weiterstadt, 4,500 sq m of temperature-controlled warehouse space is dedicated to healthcare customers, another 4,600 sq m for multi-purpose use and 620 sq m is for office space.</p>
      <p>Of the healthcare part, 3,500 sq m covers temperature from 15-25C with three dedicated truck docks, and 1,000 sq m covers temperature from 2-8C with two dedicated truck docks.</p>
      <p>Volker Werner, Panalpina's district manager for Central Germany says: "The facility is not only set up for multimodal transport; we have fully equipped it to meet all possible requirements of our pharma customers. Besides thermos-cover handling, re-icing and gel-pack handling, we can also take care of the temperature-controlled last-mile delivery, with 24-hour monitoring of the cargo."</p>
      <p>Stephen Kay, regional manager of Panalpina's healthcare industry vertical says: "In combination with Panalpina's other European centres of excellence, we have a highly flexible set-up, where we can move products to every continent by air or ocean freight and using either active or passive cooling. Based on the customers' requirements, we can also choose between commercial carriers or the Panalpina Charter Network with its main hub in nearby Luxembourg."</p>

      <p>As it celebrates its first year of digitalisation, Etihad Cargo prepares to launch a range of new projects to drive the programme forward.</p>
      <p>"Our digitalisation roadmap is only in its infancy," says Abdulla Mohamed Shadid, Etihad Aviation Group's managing director cargo and logistics services.</p>
      <p>"The foundations have been laid for a number of exciting projects in coming months, including our new, soon-to-launch and state-of-the-art Cargo Control Centre, a brand new website and mobile app, dynamic pricing and APIs to support several new booking channels.</p>
      <p>"It's all part of our commitment to make Etihad Cargo a market leader in air cargo digitalisation, something only a handful of carriers can boast today."</p>
      <p>Etihad Cargo implemented a full overhaul of its booking processes and platforms 12 months ago with the successful migration of its front-end systems to SPRINT – an IBS iCargo fully integrated technology platform that combined six legacy Etihad platforms into one.</p>
      <p>Since its launch, the system has successfully handled almost half a million bookings, equating to 115,000 flights processed and 10 million messages from almost 3,000 customers and nearly 6,000 users.</p>
      <p>"iCargo marked a significant shift in the way Etihad Cargo operates. It was a momentous first step in our ongoing journey of improvement and adaptation to a new and exciting digitised world for air cargo," said Shadid.</p>
      <p>"We have continued to work on a number of parallel and linear initiates to further enhance customer experiences, for example simplifying the booking journey, or reducing the average time to make a booking."</p>
      <p>The half a million bookings processed in iCargo, Etihad Cargo's online booking portal which also went live last October, accounted for 20% of total bookings. The monthly booking rate grew from zero in October 2018 to 33.7% in September 2019, which Etihad describes as "an unprecedented in the industry over the timeframe".</p>
      <p>The region with the highest online booking penetration rate for Etihad Cargo is Asia, with India completing 96% of its September 2019 bookings through www.etihadcargo.com and Thailand close to the 90% mark.</p>
      <p>The Americas represents the second highest rate with the US recently crossing the 50% mark for online bookings. Etihad Cargo is working to boost the rates in Europe as several new initiatives come online.</p>
      <p>Etihad has also reaffirmed its commitment to IATA's e-AWB initiative, which aims to encourage electronic airway bills as the default contract of carriage on enabled trade lanes, and an intermediate step towards a future eFreight solution.</p>
      <p>It has engaged in detailed review and consultation with customers and handlers to establish e-AWB as its default option on all enabled trades lanes. In August, Etihad Cargo launched a dedicated to support SMEs in the process. This resulted in a significant increase in the carrier's e-AWB penetration rate, which rose from a 16-18% average in 2018 to cross the 50% mark in September – a figure expected to increase further in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <p>Temperature-controlled shipping container specialist va-Q-tec has formed a partnership with Worldwide Logistics Group to open a TempChain Service Center in Shanghai. The move is part of its strategic plan for expansion in Asia and follows the formation of subsidiaries in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.</p>
      <p>The company says it will offer Chinese clients "a comprehensive portfolio of safe, cost-efficient and green temperature-controlled packaging solutions" and its partnership with Worldwide Logistics will ensure "optimum availability and access to the company's container and box rental fleet".</p>
      <p>China's pharma market is calculated to be the second largest in the world, with the US number one. Va-Q-tec says pharma companies are growing at an above-average rate and major global healthcare players are pushing into China as they see it has great potential.</p>
      <p>"This means the annual growth rates of the demand for temperature controlled transportation and storage are the highest in the world – for outbound business and domestic distribution."</p>
      <p>Roland Rappl, responsible for the container rental business at va-Q-tec says: "We are very happy to cooperate in China with a multimodal logistics company like Worldwide Logistics. Our partner has long term experience and a great network across the country. Our TempChain Service Centre in Shanghai is for us the gate to the entire Chinese market and we have already gained business with leading players in China which rely on our advanced passive door-to-door thermal container solutions."</p>
      <p>He adds that the company's products are not only relevant for pharma and biotech products but also for other temperature-sensitive products such as high performance glues, components for the semiconductor industry and chemicals.</p>
      <p>Henry Pek from Worldwide Logistics explains that his company will receive, inspect, clean, pre-condition, prepare, load and release containers as well as boxes from va-Q-tec at the Shanghai TempChain Service Center.</p>
      <p>"In addition we will manage the entire transportation management plus Customs formalities. In the future also a direct trade facilitation or an engagement in sales and marketing is possible," he adds.</p>

      <p>UAE-based ground handler dnata has increased its ownership in two Dubai-based joint venture companies, strengthening its position in the international freight forwarding sector. The Dubai-based global air services provider has purchased a 50% stake in Dubai Express, Freightworks and a 25.5% stake in Bolloré Logistics UAE from the Kanoo Group. As a result of the transaction, dnata is now the sole owner of Dubai Express, Freightworks and holds a majority stake of 51% in Bolloré Logistics UAE. Although dnata has acquired a majority stake in Bolloré Logistics UAE, the company will continue to be operated as an integrated part of France-based Bolloré Transport and Logistics, which ranks among the world's top 10 transport and logistics companies. The parties have agreed not to disclose the details of the transaction. The current leadership teams will continue to manage the business and operations. Bernd Leo Struck, senior vice president UAE Cargo and DWC Airline Services, dnata, said: "As one of the world's leading cargo service operators, dnata offers a comprehensive product portfolio, including a broad range of logistics and freight forwarding services, to fully meet the diverse needs of customers. "This strategic investment underlines dnata's commitment to the freight forwarding industry and its growing importance. We are driven to provide superior services to the regional market as well the worldwide network of Bolloré Transport &amp; Logistics as their regional partner." Struck, who is also chairman of Freightworks and Bolloré Logistics, added: "We thank our previous joint venture partner, Kanoo Group, for their long-standing partnership with dnata which lasted for over 30 years." The Kanoo Group, based in the UAE, is a diversified business conglomerate with the main scope in logistics.  Freightworks, operating under the licence of Dubai Express, was established in 1976 and is a Dubai-based international multimodal freight forwarder, logistics and supply chain provider. Its services includes customs compliance, project cargo planning, AOG/aircraft parts and ship spares logistics as well as full service handling of events and exhibitions. The company also provides commercial and private removal services to local and international origins and destinations including a 'white gloves' fine art division, while linking the supply chain requirements of customers through its network of partners worldwide. Bolloré Logistics UAE is one of the region's largest logistic solutions providers. Specialising in international freight forwarding and transportation, the company operates in 106 countries. Its offering includes multi-modal transportation, customs and compliance services, supply chain management and the management of industrial projects.  In January this year, Bolloré Logistics UAE was awarded the Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) status by Dubai Customs. </p>

      <p>Korean Air's cargo division has gone live with an integrated revenue management solution, an extension of IBS Software's iCargo cloud platform.</p>
      <p>IBS deployed its iCargo cloud platform earlier this year to improve operational efficiency. And now with addition of the module into the iCargo solution, the cargo carrier expects to improve yields and boost profitability. The solution ensures maximum profitability to the carrier by allowing Korean Air to determine the selling price of capacity, with its intelligent, intuitive analysis and algorithms, fully integrated to the core sales and booking system.</p>
      <p>American Airlines Cargo undergoes major modernisation upgrade</p>
      <p>Working in close collaboration with Korean Air to define its needs for this business-critical function, IBS incorporated its full data analytics and machine learning capabilities to develop the solution. The solution provides airlines and ground handlers in air cargo business with successful management of sales, operations, revenue accounting, mail handling, mail revenue accounting and cargo revenue accounting.</p>
      <p>iCargo replaces legacy systems at Pos Aviation-powered airports in Malaysia</p>
      <p>As part of this phase of this rollout, IBS also rolled out the new Sales App mobility module, designed to support sales and marketing teams with maximum conversion of opportunities by providing real time access to customer profiles, customer analytics and capacity predictions to support Korean Air cargo operations. In addition, several new automation tools were also introduced for terminal operations at Incheon Airport, the hub of Korean Air cargo operations.</p>
      <p>Noh Sam Sug, head of Cargo &amp; senior vice president, Korean Air cargo said: "Korean Air looks forward to partner with IBS Software in future opportunities related to cargo and other core airline business systems as well."</p>
      <p>Ashok Rajan, SVP &amp; head of Airline Cargo Services, IBS Software said: "The addition of revenue management to the iCargo platform is an exciting new development in our mission to support airlines all over the world generate maximum value from their operations and gain a competitive edge. We are proud to be associated with an industry stalwart like Korean Air in this journey."</p>

      <p>BERLIN — IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validator's (CEIV) program has been around since August 2013, but still remains a mystery to many in the industry.</p>
      <p>But that mystery is dissolving as the number of CEIV certified entities — a certification that the enterprise adheres to the highest standard of excellence for the handling of pharmaceuticals — begin to accumulate.</p>
      <p>At Monday's workshop at the 2016 World Cargo Symposium, Ronald Schaeffer, project lead, CEIV Pharma, IATA, said that at present 28 companies are certified, 55 are in progress and more than 99 are in discussion. He said to expect 80 entities in 29 locations to be certified by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>That is quite impressive, since, as Fabrizio Iacobacci, vice president of ground handling company BCUBE said, "CEIV is not a diploma hung on the wall. Everyday variables change, so you need to continually reassess your risks." Fellow ground handler, Barbara Col, marketing and communications manager with ALHA Group at Malpensa and Fumicino Airports in Italy, said the validation process is tough, but since ALHA completed certification in September 2015 the company has grown 15 percent in exports and 42 percent in imports. "We consider ourselves a local hero in Italy," she said.</p>
      <p>Andrea Gruber, senior manager, special cargo for IATA, said CEIV was initially targeted at ground handlers but it's evolved to include companies dealing with storage, transport and all of the links in the supply chain. All of these entities need to comply with required regulations, such as the EU's Good Distribution Practices (GDP), regardless whether or not they achieved CEIV certification. Compliance depends on the activity of the company, whether it be national, international or global. There are some authorities that do not endorse CEIV she said, mainly for political reasons. But in Singapore, where six companies at Changi Airport are going through CEIV certification, the country's regulator for health products is open to endorse CEIV and will be observing the CEIV training.</p>
      <p>The workshop also shed light on just who these independent validators are. Celine Crahay is a project lead and independent validator for IATA. To become one she said it helps to have auditing and/or pharmaceutical experience, attend training, and to not have had a commercial relationship with any company in the industry for 12 months prior to the engagement. She said the scope of CEIV is much wider than the EU's GDP. Warehousing, lane validation, supplier management and freight forwarding are all in the CEIV scope.</p>
      <p>Airport communities are springing up as well, that are rallying companies to gain certification. Miami-Dade airport created a community that was CEIV certified late last year. Joe Napoli, chief of staff for Miami Dade Aviation Department, said one out of four jobs in Miami depends on the airport. As the No. 1 airport in the U.S. for international cargo and the largest gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as an area with a large pharma base, it made sense. Napoli said the certification brought great interest to the airport, which was the point. Diego Sandoval of LAN Cargo said it is also in the process of CEIV certification since it is based in Miami. Likewise for Lufthansa, which is pursuing verification for both its Lufthansa Cargo and Cool Center hub in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>CAL Cargo Airlines' Navot Hirschhorn said 65 percent of the cargo it carries is special cargo, so CAL became the first certified all-cargo airline worldwide to be certified across the entire chain – its hub, airline and road feeder service are all certified. He said it has minimized and controlled tarmac time and increased pharma awareness and the result has been a return on the investment, which was the goal. Air France/KLM is certified at CDG and Schiphol Airports, as are Air France and KLM both. Bert Allard Jorritsma, a manager at AF/KLM, said it sets a standard for the chain. The benefits, he said, are transparent quality service standards, alignment in the pharma supply chain and improved training for all AF/KLM operations.</p>
      <p>Back to the "not just a diploma on the wall" comment, Gruber said it's all about quality. Once a company receives certification, there are frequent compliance checks, and after three years a re-validation is required, so it's not as though a company can relax once it is certified.</p>
      <p>CEIV could become even more critical. CEIV may soon become mandatory, or at least the baseline for handling pharmaceuticals transported by air, and that might lead to more systemic changes in the industry.</p>

      <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) has launched a Thrucool product to transport high-value, time-sensitive and temperature-controlled pharma and healthcare shipments. Thrucool offers dedicated cold chain services, said SIA in a statement, including "priority uplift and handling, quick ramp transfers at airports, cold room facilities, thermal blankets and covers for crucial insulation". SIA has partnered with terminal operator SATS, ground handler Cargologic and Qantas Freight to launch an IATA CEIV Pharma certificated "quality corridor" along the Zurich-Singapore-Sydney route as an initial offering. SIA senior vice president cargo, Chin Yau Seng, said: "As the first airline in the Asia-Pacific region to be CEIV Pharma-certified, the launch of Thrucool reinforces our commitment to provide customers dedicated cold  chain  services when transporting time- and temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical shipments. "We are acutely aware of the life-saving role these shipments play  in  societies  across the world and Thrucool is our assurance that our customers' cargo will receive the best care not only on our flights but also on the ground during transit. "We will continue to collaborate with our  industry  partners  to  expand  our  network  of quality corridors to further promote  the  integrity  of  pharmaceutical  products  in their journey across key trade lanes." SIA was the first airline in the Asia-Pacific region to be awarded the IATA CEIV Pharma Certification and is part of international and regional CEIV  communities such as Pharma@Changi, and Pharma. Aero, which jointly pursue innovation in the shipping of pharmaceuticals. The CEIV Pharma certification imposes extensive standards that adhere to guidelines set under the European Union's Good Distribution Practice, and World Health Organization Annex 5 Good Distribution Practices for Pharmaceutical Products.</p>

      <p>Air France KLM Martinair Cargo is currently rolling out WHAT COUNTS in the Netherlands. This scheme has been designed for customers among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Managers have bundled together a number of relevant 24/7 easy-to-connect services, tailor-made offers, and a loyalty programme, under the title WHAT COUNTS. "We are able to approach every customer in a unique way, based on their particular needs, by sending them specific offers and information appropriate to their level of specialisation. Big data and a sophisticated CRM strategy make it possible for us to adopt this approach," says Gertjan Roelands, vice president cargo Europe. WHAT COUNTS offers customers myCargo, a digital portal where customers make and manage their bookings 24/7. It contains a range of services, including Quote &amp; Book, Notify Me, Track &amp; Trace, Claims. Alongside these e-services, dedicated customer service and sales desks have been created to specialise in the specific needs of SME customers and interact with them more effectively. Customers now receive blue credits for both their cargo and passenger flights when they book Air France and KLM. These credits can be spent on airline tickets. "We have seen our market share and customer satisfaction growing in this specific customer segment in the Netherlands. At the moment, we are gradually introducing this new scheme in Germany, the UK and Italy. The rest of Europe will follow in the first half of 2018," according to Roelands.</p>

      <p>As part of its Smart Cargo Mainport Program (SCMP), Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is now linking critical flower shipment data to air waybills at source, the Dutch gateway announced at the IATA World Cargo Symposium currently under way in Dallas, Texas. The SCMP aims to increase efficiencies at Schiphol through increased data sharing and includes initiatives such as the Holland Flower Alliance Data Sharing Working Group, which piloted the scheme. "Through close collaboration between the floriculture and air cargo sectors, we are now able to link two critical sets of data and increase trust between parties by making that data available to everyone at all times," said Jonas van Stekelenburg, head of cargo at Schiphol. "The new portal uses a unique 'global standard 1' code (GLN) combined with an order number. This way the system excludes duplications of either order numbers or air waybill numbers," he explained. Shipment data (such as number of boxes, flower type and number of flowers and stems in each box) is linked to air waybill numbers and the resultant unique GLN codes give all users access to all the data in one place. Flower shipments on pilot flights from Nairobi to the Aalsmeer flower auction in the Netherlands have proven to be traceable individually and in real time throughout their journey. "This unique collaboration by means of SCMP and the Holland Flower Alliance is of great value for the precious supply chain of floriculture cargo," said Marcel de Nooijer, executive vice president Air France KLM and managing director Martinair. "By joining hands, we are really working hard to increase efficiency and quality and to lower costs throughout the whole supply chain. The development and launch of this data sharing platform is a real example that we are doing 'new stuff' benefiting all stakeholders in the floriculture chain," he added. The platform was developed after consultation with the Cargo Community identified priorities for the perishable cool chain, with the ability to track and trace at individual box level from farm to auction appearing as a unanimous priority for all parties. "The portal also ensures that only authorised parties have access to sensitive data, increasing trust and cooperation, and encouraging further collaboration towards common goals," said Koos van der Meij, project manager, Information Sharing Working Group. The next step is to present the data to the end customer in a user-friendly way; Holland Flower Alliance partners are working on this, alongside forwarders Kuehne + Nagel and Panalpina. Other projects under the SCMP banner include Pharma Gateway Amsterdam and EU Green Fast Lanes.</p>

      <p>Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS) has launched AISATS COOLPORT at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>The facility is India's 1st integrated on-airport perishable cargo handling centre and covers 11,000 square metres and cost INR 48 crores ($7.8 million) and was inaugurated by the Government of Karnataka's minister for large and medium industries and infrastructure development, Sri. R.V. Deshpande.</p>
      <p>AISATS COOLPORT aims to meet the extensive handling requirements of perishable cargo products such as pharmaceuticals, fruits, vegetables, flowers, meat and seafood.</p>
      <p>The facility has the capability to handle 40,000 tonnes per annum and through end-to-end cold chain solutions including refrigerated trucking service, indigenously developed cool trolley and thermal blanket, as well as temperature controlled container handling.</p>
      <p>Trial operations took place from October 2016 through to January 2017, and saw a 27 per cent growth in perishable tonnage in comparison to the same period last year. During the tenure of the trial operations, 4,653 tonnes (import and export) of varied temperature sensitive and perishable cargo was handled by the AISATS COOLPORT.</p>
      <p>AISATS COOLPORT recently obtained its Good Distribution Practices (GDP) certification for receiving, handling, storage and dispatch of pharmaceutical and perishable cargo as per World Health Organization (WHO) standards.</p>
      <p>AISATS also aims to achieve HACCP and IATA CEIV certifications in the near future, which it says will promote better trade facilitation and enhance the state of Karnataka's position as pharmaceutical and perishable hub of India.</p>
      <p>AISATS chief executive officer, Mike Chew says: "As India aims to become the world's third largest aviation market by 2020, we believe that the cargo industry will play a crucial role in achieving this objective.</p>
      <p>"India has aptly demonstrated the potential to maintain an upward growth trajectory year on year, despite a global slowdown. However, there is an immediate need to develop adequate infrastructure to boost the growth of the air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>"We aim to be the engine of economic growth for the region by connecting Bengaluru to the world and positioning the city as the Gateway to South India not only for passenger traffic but also for cargo. BIAL has a robust plan and strategic intent to grow the cargo business.</p>
      <p>"Our aim is to create an environment that enables our cargo partners to introduce new initiatives and facilities that cater to the burgeoning cargo demand of this region. We firmly believe new logistics that redefine the cargo business will propel us closer to our vision of being the Cargo Hub of South India and the region."</p>

      <p>Delta Cargo has officially opened its Cargo Control Center (CCC), which will support daily cargo operations across the globe. The new Atlanta facility provides comprehensive coverage of all aspects of cargo transportation and management, with the ability to track air shipments, trucks, mail, and freight – domestically and internationally. Gareth Joyce, president-cargo and senior vice president-airport customer service said: "The new Cargo Control Center is the culmination of our significant investment in technology systems and operation reliability, all with the aim of enhancing the customer experience and ensuring that they are at the center of everything we do. "Our Cargo Control Center will now know exactly where freight is at all times, anywhere on the globe. With that information, we will be far more proactive in predicting potential service issues and providing freight solutions to our customers, and that really is a game changer in the logistics industry."  The Cargo Control Center will be staffed by a cross divisional cargo team from capacity management, warehouse management, trucking, re-booking, unit load devices (ULD) management, service recovery and call center operations. The team will have the ability to view the individual elements of the shipment lifecycle and will be able to identify issues before they take place, as well as provide proactive communication and support in the situation of a delayed or cancelled flight. The centre will initially be open during business hours Monday to Friday, but will be a 24/7 operation by the end of the year. Last week, Delta Air France KLM, Virgin Atlantic and China Eastern have  revealed plans for a major strengthening of their partnership that will  involve the airlines making more equity investments.

      <p>Frankfurt is becoming Europe´s largest certified pharmaceutical hub, says the Germany gateway's Air Cargo Community. With the airport's Perishable Center and Bolloré Logistics Germany already having completed certification under IATA's (Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators) scheme, a further nine companies have also started the nine-month process. They include handlers Celebi Cargo, FCS Frankfurt Cargo Services, Fraport Ground Handling Services, LUG air cargo handling, Swissport Cargo Services Deutschland and the airline operations and Cool Center arms of German national carrier, Lufthansa Cargo. Implementation should be completed by early 2017 at the latest. At that point, over 95% of freight handling companies and approximately 85% of apron transporters and loaders will be certified. Major freight forwarders are also in the process of certification. Joachim von Winning, executive director of the Air Cargo Community Frankfurt, said: "With comprehensive certification of the entire process chain we will have independent confirmation and can recommend Frankfurt as the Pharma-Gateway for Europe. At the same time we also see the certification process as an opportunity to optimize services and processes…and respond even better to the needs and requirements of freight forwarders and pharmaceutical companies." The 38-member Air Cargo Community Frankfurt covers all aspects of the cargo supply chain with the objective of promoting Frankfurt as an airfreight hub. It intends to have each step of the process certified to ensure reliability and security and is also coordinating special training for the employees of participating firms. With more than 100,000 tonnes of pharmaceutical freight a year using Frankfurt, the Air Cargo Community Frankfurt and its Temperature Controlled Transport – Pharma competence team are also checking each step of the process for possible optimization. It is developing new shared products, such as the Cool Dolly to offer a cost-effective solution for temperature-controlled pharmaceutical shipments on the apron. It has also arranged a visit programme for representatives of pharmaceutical companies to show what Frankfurt has to offer.</p>

      <p>American Airlines and US Airways have completed their merger and will become one air freight organisation from October 20. The two US carriers, who have been integrating shared cargo locations for the past nine months, will transition to a single air waybill using the American Airlines prefix 001. In a letter to customers, Jim Butler – president of American Airlines Cargo – says: "The cargo team has been working hard to plan for a seamless transition and I thank you for your patience and loyalty during this time. "The objective of our integration has been to bring together the expertise, solutions, and teams you've relied on from both cargo organisations into the industry's most customer-focused airfreight partner." All American Airlines and US Airways booking channels will still be available adds Butler, including customer contact centres and the aacargo.com website, allowing customers to book 001 air waybills across both networks for flights on October 20 "and beyond". For shipments originating between now and October 19, cargo customers are asked to continue using US Airways (037) and American Airlines (001) air waybills when "booking, tendering, and recovering shipments with each respective airline". Butler adds: "The combination of our networks is only the beginning of many exciting changes built around your needs. With initiatives like e-freight, a new state-of-the-art pharmaceutical facility in Philadelphia, and 70 new wide body and hundreds of narrow body aircraft on the way, we are modernising the cargo business with you in mind. "Our most important goal is to ensure a smooth experience for you and your extended team. In the coming weeks, you will receive more details about what this transition means and how you can best take advantage of the benefits."  Did you find this article of interest, if so why not register for a FREE digital subscription to Air Cargo News? – Find out more Interested in Freighters, if so why not register to attend the Freighter &amp; Belly Cargo World Conference ? – Find out more</p>

      <p>Cargo 2000 is to get a new identity and will launch a new data project and certification scheme as part of a revamp of the organisation. At the World Cargo Symposium, the IATA organisation revealed that it would now go by the name of Cargo iQ as part of a strategic transformation programme. The revamp will also see it launch a Smart Data Project, as well as a new audit and certification scheme. The data project will add 110m lines of performance information annually to existing measurements to allow members to improve their processes. Ten million airport-to-airport and 5.5m door-to-door shipments were measured by Cargo iQ in 2015, enabling members to take action to improve and standardise internal processes by identifying where quality was an issue. IATA global head of cargo Glyn Hughes said: "The air cargo industry continues to face enormous challenges and in order to fulfil the value proposition shippers demand, we must focus much more on delivering quality. "Cargo iQ's new approach to benchmarking and the use of smart data will help ensure we can indeed meet that objective."   The group will also implement a new audit and certification scheme, which is focused on giving the Cargo iQ Quality Management System Certification higher international recognition. Cargo iQ executive director Ariaen Zimmerman said: "Cargo iQ members work together to measure success and continuously improve the value of airfreight for customers. "We have successfully developed a system with clear milestones and unique route maps, and thanks to our reliable monitoring, members can improve their services to customers. "We are excited to embark on this next chapter of our work, which benefits the whole industry, with innovative ideas and new members." Cargo iQ membership board chairman Max Sauberschwarz, who is also Kuehne+Nagel's global head of carrier and gateway air logistics, said he was looking forward to the rebrand building positive momentum for the organisation's work in the industry. "Cargo iQ stands for collaboration, trust, quality, reliability, and innovation," he said. "Our organisation provides value for our members and for the air freight industry and we are excited to be progressing with the new name now, based on the achievements of the group to date." The group also announced that Emirates SkyCargo, Brussels Airport, Vienna Airport and CargoAware had joined the organisation. Emirates divisional senior vice president, cargo, Nabil Sultan said: "With the rebranding of Cargo iQ and the launch of their strategic transformation programme, we felt that the time was right to become a member. "We look forward to making meaningful contributions to the group as well as learning from fellow members to further improve our own quality assurance programme." </p>

      <p>Brussels Airport has launched its first application using blockchain technology, which it describes as the next step in the landside management tool it is developing with stakeholders in the BRUcargo airfreight community. Steven Polmans, head of cargo and logistics at Brussels Airport and chairman of the community organisation Air Cargo Belgium, explained: "The new Freight Management App 1.0 will replace the handover of cargo from handlers to forwarder from a paper-based process by a digital rights/release process." The app will work in conjunction with existing apps such as the Slot Booking App, as well as apps that are yet to be developed. It is part of Brussels Airport's strategic objective of fully digitalising the logistics flow with the support of applications offered via the BRUcloud open data sharing platform, the focus now being to make the import process paperless, more efficient and transparent. Polmans added: "The support of all our stakeholders, from gathering ideas to implementing new tools and applications, is crucial in the success of our BRUcloud platform." BRUcloud aims to facilitate data sharing in a cloud environment among the BRUcargo community. According to Brussels Airport cargo business development manager Sara Van Gelder, it enables the various stakeholders in the air cargo supply chain to work in a more integrated way, acting as a network. She said: "Data will be stored only once, centrally. Once a company is connected to the cloud, it can start using the different existing applications and can start exchanging information very easily with other stakeholders instead of maintaining system-to-system connections with all different partners individually."   Ground handler Worldwide Flight Services regional vice president Marc Claesen said: "For WFS, [BRUcloud] is the way forward in a rapidly changing industry, whereby expectations from stakeholders will only be met in the future by those companies who believe in modernisation and industry data sharing. "We are glad to be an early adaptor of this unique tool and platform and believe that this is only the start of a very promising development whereby the cargo industry as a whole will benefit, with Brussels taking a leading pioneer role." Chief executive DHL Global Forwarding Belgium and Luxemburg Luc Jacobs added: "We firmly believe that an increasing transparency and reliability will decrease the overall supply chain costs in the future."

      <p>At the recently concluded Air Cargo China event, two important players from the air cargo industry signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation in the sector of time &amp; temperature sensitive shipments, primarily focusing on pharmaceutical and healthcare products.</p>
      <p>As part of the MoU, both IATA CEIV Pharma-certified companies - AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) and Shanghai Pudong International Airport Cargo Terminal (PACTL) will work together to develop, expand, and promote business cooperation in this area.</p>
      <p>This also corresponds to the strategic cooperation agreement between ABC and Shanghai Airport Authority signed in September 2017.</p>
      <p>The MoU focuses on the enhancement of operations for pharmaceutical shipments by optimising internal procedures, strengthening personnel skills, and leveraging innovative IT technologies.</p>
      <p>"The pharmaceutical sector sets the high level of expectations for all supply chain stakeholders. Understanding the need for high-end services our customers expect us to provide, we work with forward-thinking and trustworthy partners. We are proud to have PACTL among our strategic partners, sharing the same values and business prospects towards the development of the pharmaceutical sector," highlighted Sergey Lazarev, general director of AirBridgeCargo Airlines.</p>
      <p>Christian Haug, vice president of PACTL said: "Now it's the right time to collaborate with AirBridgeCargo. PACTL's IATA CEIV has been granted since the very beginning of 2016 and the PACTL Cool Center is the newest contribution to cool chain infrastructure for all temperature sensitive goods in PVG. The facility is about 3500m2 and with the capacity to handle 100,000 tonnes annually. Meanwhile, PACTL provides integrated, qualified, and reliable cool center solutions, and advocate to eco-friendly concepts to improve the customer values. There's no doubt that PACTL will assist AirBridgeCargo to coordinate with all parties for TTSP shipment handling and storage."</p>
      <p>China has been the backbone of ABC's strategy from the day first of its operations, with the company strengthening its footprint and introducing more destinations and frequencies to meet the needs of its customers.</p>
      <p>Shanghai was among ABC's first online stations in China and the company is increasing frequencies each season, currently operating more than 20 weekly flights, with the support of its trusted and reliable partners, such as PACTL.</p>

      <p>Air India SATS Airport Services has officially launched AISATS COOLPORT, India's first integrated on-airport perishable cargo handling centre, at Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru. The 11,000 sq m facility is designed to meet handling requirements for perishable cargo such as pharmaceuticals, fruit, vegetables, flowers, meat and seafood. It is able to handle up to 40,000 tons of cargo per annum and offers end-to-end cold chain benefits including refrigerated trucking services, cool trolleys and thermal blankets, as well as temperature controlled container handling. The trial operating period of AISATS COOLPORT, which extended from October 2016 to January 2017, saw a 27% growth in perishable tonnages in comparison to the same period last year. During those months, 4,653 tonnes (import and export) of various temperature-sensitive and perishable cargo – both import and export freight – was handled through the AISATS COOLPORT facility. AISATS COOLPORT recently obtained its Good Distribution Practice (GDP) certification for receiving, handling, storing and dispatching pharmaceutical and perishable cargo. AISATS also hopes to achieve IATA Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) certification in the near future. Mike Chew, CEO of AISATS, commented: "As India aims to become the world's third-largest aviation market by 2020, we believe that the cargo industry will play a crucial role in achieving this objective. "India has aptly demonstrated the potential to maintain an upward growth trajectory year on year, despite a global slowdown. However, there is an immediate need to develop adequate infrastructure to boost the growth of the air cargo industry. "We at AISATS developed the COOLPORT, with invaluable support from the Government of India's ASIDE (Assistance to States for Infrastructure Development for Exports &amp; Allied Activities) scheme," Chew explained. He continued: "The COOLPORT addresses the need for specialised infrastructure amenities catering to cold chain processes, operations and logistics and we at AISATS partner the government of Karnataka's vision of turning the Kempegowda International Airport into a preferred air cargo hub in southern India." Hari Marar, president, airport operations, for Kempegowda International Airport, remarked: "We aim to be the engine of economic growth for the region by connecting Bengaluru to the world and positioning the city as the gateway to south India not only for passenger traffic but also for cargo. "BIAL has a robust plan and strategic intent to grow the cargo business. Our aim is to create an environment that enables our cargo partners to introduce new initiatives and facilities that cater to the burgeoning cargo demand of this region. "We firmly believe new logistics that redefine the cargo business will propel us closer to our vision of being the cargo hub of south India and the region." The new facility represents a "validation of our partnership and commitment by both BIAL and our partners to continue to explore new ways of enhancing efficient and seamless cargo operations", Marar concluded.</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo recently commenced its expanded cool center at the Frankfurt Airport, which is the largest hub for temperature-sensitive air cargo consignments of any airline in Europe.</p>
      <p>Located in an area admeasuring 8,000-square-metres, the cargo cool center offers four cold-storage rooms, which maintains different temperatures (2 to 8°C, 15 to 25°C, and 5 to 15°C), as well as a deep-freeze room (-12 to -20°C), which has direct access to the apron.</p>
      <p>With a guarantee of precise temperature control, exclusive handling, short transfer distances and specially trained employees, Lufthansa Cargo can ensure highest requirements in the cool-chain logistics are met round-the-clock, with its Cool/td product.</p>
      <p>"The excellent collaboration with numerous shippers from the pharmaceutical and chemical industries has consistently increase the demand for our service," said Jorg Bodenroder, senior director handling specials, Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>"We are now in the position to offer our customers with much greater capacity, and optimum processes in our cool center," said Bodenroder.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has recently cemented its position as a leader in the cool-chain cargo segment by launching numerous new products and services related to the cool center. It includes Road Feeder Service Cool (RFS-Cool) booking option, which ensures the temperature-sensitive cargo is actively or passively cooled or warmed, not just on the aircraft, but also during road link connections, where correspondingly equipped vehicles are deployed. Customers can make their booking within Europe with the RFS-Cool for transportation of sensitive medication," said Bodenroder.</p>
      <p>Since last July, every cargo in the passive refrigeration sector worldwide was protected by a reflective film produced exclusively by Lufthansa Cargo. It offered all sensitive shipments with optimum protection against the sunlight on the airport tarmacs around the world, even during the summer season.</p>
      <p>In October, Lufthansa Cargo also announced its collaboration in the passive refrigeration sector with va-Q-tec, a leading provider of high-performance thermal containers.</p>
      <p>Thanks to this new cooperation, va-Q-tec containers are now available across many cargo airline's stations, globally.</p>
      <p>Customers shipping pharmaceutical goods can now benefit from the combination of Lufthansa Cargo's closely-meshed and extensive network, and the advanced container rental service.</p>
      <p>The high-quality transport containers, known as va-Q-tainers, provide temperature-controlled solutions in six temperature ranges, between -70 to +25 degree Celsius in five sizes, and can hold up to two US pallets.</p>
      <p>It also offers constant temperature control for several days, without using external any energy sources.</p>

      <p>Belgian hub Brussels Airport has launched a second pharmaceuticals certification programme for its cool chain community. BRUcargo last year became the first airport to be awarded IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Handling programme (CEIV Pharma). "With the launch of this second group the majority of all pharma shipments at Brussels Airport will be handled in a fully certified cool chain", says Nathan De Valck, cargo account manager at Brussels Airport. "The big interest from our local partners in the BRUcargo community is a clear proof that CEIV Pharma is rapidly gaining acceptance as a universal, independent and comprehensive compliance and training programme." Eleven companies covering the entire Brussels cool chain took part in the 2014 programme: three on-line handling agents, two airlines, five forwarding agents and one trucking company. Steven Polmans, head of cargo at the hub, said: "Brussels Airport is now recognised by the pharma industry as the preferred pharma gateway in our region. "The fact that we have had so much good feedback from the first group of companies and seen the interest we got from the market to do a second wave, shows the strength of the program for all." Continued Polmans: "We are delighted to understand that participating companies are seeing additional business, simplified audits from pharma shippers and increased market visibility." Nine BRUcargo based companies have confirmed their commitment to obtain the IATA CEIV pharma certificate, among them: DHL Global Forwarding, Kuehne + Nagel, Geodis Wilson, Hazgo, FB Logistics, Ninatrans and Van Dievel Transport By the end of this year, some twenty BRUcargo-based companies will have obtained the IATA CEIV pharma certification programme. CEIV pharma takes the binding requirements of the national and international good distribution practice (GDP) regulations that are already in place and harmonises these into a globally valid programme using airfreight-focused, on-site training and an integrated, independent audit capability.  The certification programme aims at improving the handling of pharmaceutical cargo by upgrading, aligning and standardising the pharma handling processes at every location in the world.  Cargo traffic at Brussels Airport grew significantly, up 11.7% on February 2014: " A notable fact is the very strong growth that was recorded in the full-freighter segment," said an airport spokesman.</p>

      <p>AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) has established a new round-the-clock Control Tower (CT) operation to monitor consignments of special cargoes. CT will "proactively respond to service disruptions" to ensure the all-cargo carrier consistently meets customers' delivery deadlines, claims the airline.</p>
      <p>The operation will be managed by a team of fully-trained supply chain specialists and be based in Moscow. The CT provides real-time monitoring of all cargo movements throughout the entire transportation process across the airline's international network, from booking to final customer delivery. The team is responsible for identifying and resolving any potential disruption to planned shipment deliveries that can result from a diverse range of circumstances. These include schedule disruption, documentation issues and the influence of bad weather conditions.</p>
      <p>"Our new Control Tower is a 'point of convergence' which will accumulate all of our cargo movement data to consistently meet our service commitments and to take preventative or corrective actions as appropriate when they see a potential disruption developing. We have a highly experienced team of professionals managing the Control Tower who have the capabilities and skills to manage any challenges that can arise. This will be the foundation of our next step forwards in the arena of special cargoes, and is ultimately designed to provide benefits to final consumers, be it medicines or vaccines for their health and well-being, aircraft engines to resolve AOG situations and ensure passengers reach their destinations in good time, or the on-time delivery of cross-border ecommerce purchases for special occasions. ABC is committed to ensuring we can cater to the needs of our customers," says Sergey Lazarev, general director of AirBridgeCargo Airlines.</p>
      <p>The transportation of special cargo commodities has been at the forefront of ABC's operations and growth throughout 2017, with special cargo volumes showing a 12 per cent growth year-on-year. The ABC Control Tower is reachable via telephone, Skype or e-mail and serves as a prime contact for niche product deliveries.</p>
      <p>One of the team's first troubleshooting operations was to find alternative capacity to maintain the delivery timescale of a special cargo shipment from Asia to Europe after bad weather conditions disrupted expected flight departures from the region.</p>

      <p>The CEIV bug appears to be spreading in the United States. Just a day after Delta Cargo announced that it had earned IATA's CEIV-Pharma certification, Amerijet International announced today that it had also earned a CEIV-Pharma cert, making it the first U.S.-based all-cargo airline to be awarded with the designation, although the actual certification was completed on June 27, 2017.</p>
      <p>Flying 65,000 tonnes of temperature-controlled products annually, Amerijet said the certification gives it an edge in the high-margin pharma transport business.</p>
      <p>With a direct cargo route between Miami and Brussels set to launch in the second quarter of 2018, Amerijet will also soon be flying between two of the biggest pharma shipment hubs on the two continents. Miami and Brussels airports founded pharma.aero, a cross-industry collaboration for pharma shippers, CEIV-certified cargo communities, airport operators and other air cargo industry stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Glyn Hughes, IATA's global head of cargo, said that Amerijet's investments would contribute towards, "a stronger, more competitive and enhanced air cargo service for pharmaceuticals in North and Latin America."</p>
      <p>The carrier operates a 30,000-square-meter facility in Miami that includes temperature-controlled handling, with active alarm systems, temperature data recorders and 24/7 CCTV monitoring. Computer-monitored pharmaceutical cooling chambers provide storage environments for ambient (15°C to 25°C), chilled (2°C to 8°C), and frozen (0°C and below) shipments.</p>
      <p>Rasheme Richardson, vice president of airport operations for Amerijet, added that the carrier, "demands the same uniform standards and processes from all of our business partners, including our handlers and trucking companies. Complying with the healthcare cold-chain logistics standards, expected from pharmaceutical manufacturers and life sciences companies, helps to support the global healthcare initiative of putting patient safety first."</p>

    <title>Air Canada speeds up on-line booking for all cargo</title>

      <p>Along with a new look website, Air Canada Cargo has unveiled a new on-line booking tool that allows established customers to complete a booking and receive an air waybill (AWB) number in less than two minutes, writes Ian Putzger. With effect from August 11, forwarders that have an account with the airline can utilise the new tool to book as well as manage their shipments on-line. The available booking window is 29 days. Unlike most on-line booking mechanisms, which are limited to general cargo, AC's new set-up can handle the full gamut of the carrier's offerings, including temperature-controlled services and hazardous goods transportation. Customers log in to access a dashboard that allows them to make bookings as well as track shipments. They can view the status of all their current shipments, fill out an e-AWB, add to the house AWB, edit a shipment or print a document pouch. The system automatically populates most data entry fields, calculates the volume of a shipment and uses customer-specific rates to make an estimated quote for the cost of the shipment. In addition to special cargoes, the system also handles shipments that move beyond AC's own network on interline partners, showing a variety of possible routings and flights to choose from. Vito Cerone, director of marketing and sales for the Americas, says that the set-up was developed in close cooperation with customers. "We have been talking a lot to customers to try to find ways to simplify the supply chain and make it easier for them to deal with us," he says. The airline's focus on its clients is also reflected in the recent creation of a customer experience department and a beefed-up call centre with technology designed to give service agents better tools to deal with customers' issues. Over the past couple of years AC has revamped many internal processes and ramped up its IT platform to speed up and/or simplify processes. The latest move on that front came in May, when management signed an agreement with Mercator for a new revenue management and accounting solution, which is scheduled to come on stream in the latter half of next year. Customers can access the website to use the new booking and tracking from their mobile devices, although a tablet would be better suited than a mobile phone, Cerone remarks. He adds that the airline is looking to add further functionality down the road to cover documents besides the AWB. The new booking functionality is throwing the door wide open for forwarders to embrace e-AWBs, a cause that AC has championed from the outset. At the same time, there is always the option for customers to print a paper copy. "If the customer wants a paper invoice, he can print a PDF," Cerone says.</p>

      <p>Handler and aviation catering services provider SATS is working with TUM CREATE, a research platform for the improvement of Singapore's public transportation systems, on what they jointly describe as the world's first artificial intelligence (AI) powered robotic air cargo system.</p>
      <p>They believe that SPEEDCARGO will help in the ongoing industry effort to digitise air cargo handling and transform otherwise laborious processes in the airfreight industry.</p>
      <p>According to a statement from the two Singapore-based concerns, "The industry stands to benefit from improved productivity and time savings, in addition to higher throughput and load factors."</p>
      <p>The statement outlined: "Using SPEEDCARGO, airlines would be able to optimise their cargo hold based on volume, weight, and other criteria with a click."</p>
      <p>SPEEDCARGO is an integrated system actually made up of three products – CARGO EYE, CARGO MIND and CARGO ARM, which are targeted at optimising cargo acceptance as well as cargo palletisation through intelligent ULD planning and automatic ULD packing.</p>
      <p>Its AI-powered operating system "enables seamless data connectivity for end-to-end optimisation, and improves safety and security across cargo operations", SATS and TUM CREATE said.</p>
      <p>Test bed</p>
      <p>The SATS Airfreight Terminal in Singapore has been used as a test bed, with TUM CREATE personnel on site since October last year working with SATS during both the prototype development phase and ongoing trials.</p>
      <p>According to SATS and TUM CREATE, they have achieved a 99.99% accuracy rate for the dimensioning of accepted cargo during trials of CARGO EYE.</p>
      <p>CARGO EYE produces a digital fingerprint for incoming cargo in real time using a 3D camera system for better pallet optimisation.</p>
      <p>SATS and TUMCREATE have confirmed that they are currently making progressive enhancements to both CARGO MIND and CARGO ARM with the aim of commercialising each product in a phased approach.</p>
      <p>Funding assistance</p>
      <p>The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) facilitated the project through its Aviation Challenge competition, in which TUM CREATE was awarded S$1.9m for SPEEDCARGO's prototype development over two years.</p>
      <p>The project has also received S$4m in funding from the National Research Foundation Singapore's Central Gap Fund.</p>
      <p>"Piloting this technology in Singapore is part of our wider innovation programme to enhance services and scale our operational efficiency," commented Alex Hungate, president and chief executive of SATS.</p>
      <p>He continued: "These capabilities would enhance our cargo network across Asia Pacific, along with COSYS+, our cloud-based cargo terminal management system, to augment real-time cargo visibility along our digital corridors."</p>
      <p>Suraj Nair, head of SPEEDCARGO Technology, added: "This partnership with SATS is a unique opportunity for us to develop our technology into a fit-for-purpose solution for the airfreight industry."</p>

      <p>The increasing data link-up between shippers and ports was in evidence last week when an Alibaba-led group, developing common standards for supply chain visibility, on the eve of its first anniversary released Enabling Logistics Visibility by Interconnecting Logistics Information Service Systems in a Standardised Way.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, North American operator Global Container Terminals (GCT) announced it had joined blockchain consortium Tradelens.</p>
      <p>The Logistics Visibility Task Force was set up by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibabawith its in-house logistics operator Cainiao Network, China's National Logistics Information Platform (LOGINK) and the International Port Community System Association (IPCSA), which comprises port community systems, cargo community systems, sea and airport authorities and single-window operators in around 40 countries.</p>
      <p>Like other industry-wide digitisation-inspired initiatives, such as the Digital Container Shipping Association, its chief aim is to develop a set of common standards that would allow different community systems to relay data to each other.</p>
      <p>Zhu Hongru, head of standardisation at Alibaba, explained: "[We] will work together to build the task force into a platform for international logistics information sharing, which will also inform the development of standards and promote collaborative working.</p>
      <p>"This work will inform ISO standards and become industry de facto standards, which will be used in the construction of global smart supply chains."</p>
      <p>Gu Xuemei, Cainiao Network chief technology officer, added: "Standards have become the universal language and logistics technical standards are an important way of information sharing among logistics partners.</p>
      <p>"Full supply chain visibility means that when users purchase goods from other countries online, they can track in real time where the package is located. This makes it easier for users to shop across borders and facilitates the flow of information in the global logistics system."</p>
      <p>Over the past year, Cainiao Network has been working on these interface standards with LOGINK and the port community systems of Hamburg, Antwerp and Rotterdam.</p>
      <p>In a separate development, GCT, which operates two terminals apiece in New York and Vancouver, said it had joined the Maersk/IBM-launched blockchain initiative Tradelens to bring it a competitive edge.</p>
      <p>"Joining a technology platform like TradeLens adds to our capability to deliver best-in-class service and visibility to our supply chain partners," said Doron Grosman, GCT president and chief executive.</p>
      <p>"As competition increases from other ports and customer demands intensify, we need to activate every solution to increase cargo velocity through our terminals and improve performance," he added.</p>

      <p>Panalpina has acquired Dutch company Interfresh Airfreight Handling – which specialises in the Customs clearance and last-mile distribution of imported perishables from Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.</p>
      <p>Panalpina will also takeover sister companies Fresh Cargo Connection and Dutch Cargo Connection, subject to conditions.</p>
      <p>All three companies are fully owned by CEO and founder of Interfresh, Sonja Kauffman. The parties reached a respective agreement yesterday.</p>
      <p>Located at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol with offices, a cold storage facility and an experienced team, the three companies handle around 20,000 tonnes of perishables airfreight per year. Other important origin countries besides Kenya are Sri Lanka, South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, Ethiopia, Turkey, Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
      <p>The move follows the successful acquisition of Kenya-based forwarder Air Connection earlier this month, a specialised forwarder of flowers and vegetables while Panalpina also bought perishables forwarder Airflo in 2016 and grows its Perishables Network.</p>
      <p>Panalpina chief executive officer, Stefan Karlen (pictured below) says: "By acquiring Interfresh we gain full control over the cool chain for one of the perishables industry's most important trade lanes for flowers – from Nairobi to Amsterdam and beyond.</p>
      <p>"It is also a logical transaction as the primary customer of Interfresh is Air Connection, the Kenya-based forwarder that we successfully acquired earlier this year."</p>
      <p>The latest acquisition allows Panalpina to significantly expand its perishables offering in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Having its own fleet of vehicles, Interfresh specialises in the customs clearance and last-mile distribution of imported flowers from Kenya and different types of perishables from many origin countries in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.</p>
      <p>Fresh Cargo Connection acts as a fiscal representative for customers and Dutch Cargo Connection provides services for other perishables such as fish, fruit, vegetables and mushrooms.</p>
      <p>Interfresh founder, Sonja Kauffman says now is the right time to secure further profitable growth, especially in the regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America and Panalpina has the global network, tools and connections to help the company achieve that.</p>
      <p>Kauffman will join Panalpina as the new country head of perishables for the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>"The acquisition in the Netherlands is another significant step in building Panalpina's global Perishables Network and offering complete end-to-end solutions on a global scale. It also exemplifies how we expand our presence and expertise in destination countries and at major transportation hubs for perishables," adds Karlen.</p>

      <p>The Dakosy FAIR@Link Cargo Community Platform at Frankfurt Airport has expanded its range of import and export services. For imports, freight forwarders can now receive flight manifest data from the airlines via the integrated FAIR@Link dashboard, including status reports on incoming flights and air waybills (AWBs), allowing the necessary resources to be planned in a timely manner. In addition, a forecast containing the master AWB data can alert the freight of incoming shipments. By linking this information to the custody declarations from the ground handling agent (GHA) in FAIR@Link, the printing of the handover certificates and, if relevant, the change of depositary can be processed automatically. This achieves significant time savings by eliminating the delays between the arrival of the goods and their pick-up, says Dakosy. For exports, FAIR@Link has corresponding functions which are now being used by Röhlig Logistics. The logistics service provider has fully integrated these into its CargoSoft Transport Management System and, with support from FAIR@Link, also automated the delivery to ATLAS. The FRAPORT license plate recognition system is used at entry into CargoCity South. Once the license plate information is recognized by the camera, the Customs process is triggered in the ATLAS-certified customs software. Head of Röhlig Airfreight Gateways, Alexander Verges, said: "All stations support the process and record the truck license plate numbers in CargoSoft. We handle around 25 to 30 vehicles per week with up to 400 shipments via the automated process. "In the past, employees had to initiate the customs process manually after unloading; now it's already done. We save time and resources, especially when shipments arrive at night or weekends. The routine tasks are taken care of and our employees can focus on more important things." A door management system was introduced at handling agent FCS Frankfurt Cargo Services in the first quarter of 2017. To book a ramp, the forwarder sends a transport pre announcement to FAIR@Link. This includes the requested time for loading/unloading, freight information such as AWBs, special handling requirements or dangerous goods information, for example. FAIR@Link reviews the data and automatically assigns a slot, although the handling agent can intervene if necessary and make corrections. FCS head of Infrastructure and quality management, Steffen Kuhn, said: "We benefit from a more transparent, easy-to-plan handling process that can provide us with the necessary flexibility to deal with the ever-increasing quantity of cargo for the future. The system also brings clear improvements in the process and less work for all truckers." Dakosy says that the Platform continues to add users, including Agility, a. hartrodt, Bolloré, CHI Cargo Handling International, DHL Global Forwarding, Hellmann Worldwide Logistics and Röhlig Logistics as well as a number of airlines. Over 50 companies are already on the system, it says. Dakosy chief executive, Ulrich Wrage, concluded: "It's crucial for this location that as many logistics companies as possible participate and a high volume of freight is handled. "The participation of additional users increases the gains in efficiency for everyone. We see this as a further step in the digitalization of freight handling at Frankfurt Airport."</p>

      <p>DHL has marked its 50th anniversary with the opening of a new Americas Innovation Center in Chicago, US.</p>
      <p>The grand opening of the Center drew more than 300 guests including technology and logistics industry leaders, customers from across the region, local officials and DHL senior leadership.</p>
      <p>The 28,000 sq ft Americas Innovation Center serves as a collaborative space for DHL to work with its customers and partners. It also highlights the cost- and energy-saving technologies that DHL is currently using and investing into for the future.</p>
      <p>The logistics firm already has a European Innovation Center in Troisdorf, Germany, and an Asia Pacific Innovation Center in Singapore.</p>
      <p>Ken Allen, cheif executive of DHL eCommerce Solutions and Board Member for Customer Solutions &amp; Innovation at Deutsche Post DHL Group, commented: "Innovation has been a driving force for DHL since its inception in 1969. Now, with three Innovation Centers around the world, DHL can leverage the power of innovation to serve customers and play an active role in shaping the future of logistics."</p>
      <p>Last November, DHL Supply Chain said that it would be invest $300m in 2018 and throughout 2019 to deploy emerging technologies to 350 (of its 430) North American facilities and transportation control towers.</p>
      <p>DHL Express will continue to add more automation at its regional hubs, gateways and service centers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, DHL Global Forwarding will improve technology used to track packages and handle temperature-sensitive shipments, as well as implementing warehouse automation with RFID tracking to track cargo location, shipment consolidation and shipping schedules.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, DHL Global Forwarding unveiled a new advanced data analytics tool designed for highly sensitive cargo, such as pharma items. The tool provides quick analysis and insights for better decision-making, such as the optimal trade lanes to utilize, verification of temperature controls in transit and the ability to analyse and reduce risks.</p>
      <p>Matthias Heutger, global head of innovation and commercial development at DHL, said: "Innovation enables DHL to be at the forefront of game-changing solutions for the supply chain industry.</p>
      <p>"The Innovation Centers provide the platform for understanding emerging trends and discovering insights with the potential to drive real-world business impacts."</p>

      <p>E-commerce fulfillment startup ShipBob announced the opening of its newest warehouse in Dallas, the company's first in the Southern United States, and the first since announcing a Series B investment of US$17.5 million, led by investment firm Bain Capital Ventures.</p>
      <p>ShipBob CEO Dhruv Saxena said that, "with so many e-commerce companies in the region, we're now in the perfect position to help these companies grow their businesses by providing the highest quality shipping and logistics in the Southern region." The Dallas location will offer regional customers same-day shipping, advancing ShipBob's strategy of distributed inventory, which the company describes as, "a method of providing customers with diversified locations to reduce shipping costs, times and distance."</p>
      <p>Saxena called his company a "tech-enabled 3PL," which offers a range of services, from order management and fulfillment to data analytics and reverse logistics for returns. Companies such as ShipBob offer a competing e-commerce logistics platform to giants like Amazon.com.</p>
      <p>At this month's ELEVATE conference in Miami, Saxena said on Oct. 2 that competing with the big players means promising the same- or next-day delivery that the big integrators offer, which means "having real-time access to inventories" across all its sales channels.</p>

      <p>Cool Chain Association (CCA) members will pilot a data-sharing initiative to monitor perishable shipments on two major trade lanes in a bid to improve supply chain management and reduce food loss.</p>
      <p>The pilot, set to start in April, will focus on perishables trade lanes from Latin America to Europe, and from the US to the Middle East.</p>
      <p>It will track shipments of commodities such as avocados and berries, from grower to consignee, involving CCA members as well as growers and importers.</p>
      <p>The shipments will be monitored over a period of three months to give a sizeable body of data, which CCA said can be analysed to provide ideas for collaborative work flows to improve the cool chain.</p>
      <p>All members of the supply chain will share data to identify temperature excursions and pinch points and then work together to find solutions.</p>
      <p>The data will be analysed by food loss and waste expert Philippe Schuler, and the results will be made available to the industry to demonstrate how collaboration can improve the cool supply chain.</p>
      <p>Initial results will be discussed at the CCA's 2019 global perishables event at Fresh Park Venlo, in the Netherlands, from May 14 to 15.</p>
      <p>Eric Mauroux, director verticals, global head of perishables at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo and CCA treasurer, said: "As we move along the supply chain, we will use the information in a proactive way so that everyone within the value chain can adjust their procedures to improve the cool chain together.</p>
      <p>"We all have pieces of information but there is no platform so far for sharing it and yet data sharing not only helps us improve but also helps create value."</p>
      <p>Added Mauroux: "The data sharing will be based on information from recorders in the shipments and we will have the full coverage from the producer to the importer so that we can reconcile the temperature curve with the timeline of handling.</p>
      <p>"You can spend hours writing processes, but when it comes to making it happen on the ground, the best way to asses if it is working is looking at time, temperature, and tolerance.</p>
      <p>"Moving forward, we can test and suggest the platforms on which data is shared."</p>
      <p>The CCA has already worked on templates for global standards and certification projects for both perishables and pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>"With a third of the world's food going to waste, it is important that from grower to consumer, we all contribute to taking action," said Stavros Evangelakakis, global product manager, healthcare and perishables, Cargolux and CCA Chairman.</p>
      <p>He added: "The freight industry can do its part, ensuring proper handling, and respecting temperature during storage, build up, and transportation.</p>
      <p>"We can create value and have an impact on shelf life."</p>

      <p>Panalpina is to build a new build-to-suit facility in Singapore, which it says demonstrates its continued commitment to a strong and successful logistics platform in Asia-Pacific.</p>
      <p>Singapore country head of sales, Matthew Gallagher says: "As we celebrate 40 years of doing business in Singapore, this is Panalpina's largest ever warehousing investment outside Europe in the company's history."</p>
      <p>The freight forwarder says the investment will help itexpand its logistics business in Asia-Pacific by offering customers an ultra-efficient and tailored solution for their specific logistics needs. Construction is currently under way, and the facility will be ready for customers in early 2018.</p>
      <p>The new 30,000 square metres facility is being built at Pioneer View, next to Jurong Bird Park in West Singapore, where the city-state is developing a new deep-water port to keep up with ocean freight growth.</p>
      <p>"Singapore is a very important consolidation hub for ocean and air freight. We plan to offer our services in this area including value-added logistics services to new customers particularly in the healthcare, technology, manufacturing, consumer and retail as well as fashion industries.</p>
      <p>"And, of course, we will continue to service existing customers including global telecom equipment manufacturers, sporting goods retailers and medical equipment companies," says Gallagher.</p>
      <p>Country head of logistics in Singapore, Mark Fitzpatrick notes there are more advantages to owning and managing a facility: "Not being tied to a lease agreement opens up many opportunities that are not always available in leased premises. This freedom allows us to offer the best possible solutions for our customers.</p>
      <p>"We are very excited about this new facility. The collective features of the building, including the special rooftop, are unusual to have, and since 96 out of our top 100 customers globally have a base in Singapore, it makes perfect sense to extend our capabilities here," adds Fitzpatrick.</p>
      <p>Together with Panalpina's other facilities at Changi Airport, the Asia-Pacific LCL hub, as well as the multi-user facilities in Changi North and Jurong, the company's warehousing footprint in Singapore will soon increase to 100,000 square metres.</p>

      <p>Kuehne+Nagel (K+N) will open a pharma logistics hub in Santiago de Chile next month (August 2018) to benefit the growing pharma &amp; healthcare industry in South America. The dedicated warehouse provides K+N's temperature-controlled, door-to-door KN PharmaChain global network with an increased regional footprint. Ingo Goldhammer, president of K+N South &amp; Central America, said: "With more than 40 years demonstrating commitment to the Chilean market, this cutting-edge facility will leverage the knowledge and experience of our specialised teams and enable K+N to offer its unique pharma solutions to an extended customer base. "This investment is in line with our strategic ongoing commitment to the pharma &amp; healthcare industry globally strengthening our position as a leading player in pharma logistics." The facility will provide 17,600 sq m for storage and distribution of temperature-sensitive products, which can be extended to 23,300 sq m, including a cold chamber to handle temperature requirements of 15 to 25°C and 2 to 8°C. A renewed laboratory for quality control allows customers to comply with the regulatory requirement to carry out local analysis of imported pharmaceutical products. Additionally, good manufacturing practices (GMP) compliant repackaging and relabelling areas following Chilean and international specifications will be available as value added services. The logistics hub will use clean energy via a geothermal system to keep the temperature of its general area between 15 to 25°C. By occupying the air that circulates through the subfloor a significant reduction of energy consumption will be achieved.

    <content>
      <p>Dubai-based airfreight carrier Emirates SkyCargo has boosted its worldwide pharmaceutical handling capabilities through a range of improvements to its infrastructure and processes.</p>
      <p>First, it has begun handling pharma cargo at a new purpose-built facility in Chicago.</p>
      <p>The facility, dedicated solely for pharmaceutical shipments, covers an area of more than 1,000 sq m, with scope for further expansion in the future.</p>
      <p>It offers temperature-controlled zones (of 2-8 degrees Celsius and 15-25 degrees Celsius) for acceptance and delivery, pharma cargo build up and break down, storage and direct ramp access.</p>
      <p>The proximity of the facility to the ramp also means that temperature-sensitive pharma cargo has to spend only a short amount of time in transit to and from the terminal to the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Developed in partnership with ground handling company Maestro, the facility has a capacity of handling 15,000 tonnes of pharma shipments per annum.</p>
      <p>"Emirates SkyCargo is committed to the safe and secure transportation of temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical shipments," observed Nabil Sultan, divisional senior vice president at Emirates SkyCargo.</p>
      <p>"Having a dedicated facility for pharma at one of our busiest stations for pharma in our network is a big boost to our pharma handling credentials and capability."</p>
      <p>Sultan continued: "This was also a unique model wherein we worked closely with the ground handler and were involved in the planning for the facility from the very beginning.</p>
      <p>"Using our learnings from transporting pharma across six continents, we were able to collaborate to make the new pharma facility fit for purpose."</p>
      <p>Second, Emirates SkyCargo has continued to expand its global pharma corridor shipping network.</p>
      <p>The carrier announced its pharma corridors initiative in January 2018. Since then, Emirates SkyCargo has expanded its initial network of 12 pharma stations to a total of 20.</p>
      <p>As part of its pharma corridor programme, Emirates SkyCargo works with ground handling partners and other local stakeholders at the stations that are important origin or destination points for pharma.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the progress made in the pharma corridor programme, Henrik Ambak, Emirates senior vice president, cargo operations worldwide, commented: "Pharmaceutical cargo[s] being transported by air are growing in their sophistication and complexity in terms of the strict regulations for handling and temperature control.</p>
      <p>"We introduced the pharma corridors initiative because we wanted to expand the required high standard of handling for pharma shipments further into our network and serve markets better from origin to destination."</p>
      <p>Ambak informed: "We have been successfully working with our ground handling partners at our major pharma points and the model has met with quite a lot of success and positive feedback from our customers.</p>
      <p>"This has motivated us to replicate the model at more pharma stations, thus growing our pharma corridors network to more than 20 stations.</p>
      <p>"We'll continue to look at how pharma flows through our network and add more stations in the future," he promised.</p>
      <p>Finally, Emirates SkyCargo's hub operation in Dubai has been re-certified as EU Good Distribution Practices (GDP) compliant.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo's pharma operations in Dubai, including its 24/7 trucking operations between its terminals at Dubai International Airport and Dubai World Central, have been re-certified as compliant again this year.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo first received GDP certification in 2016, subsequently being revalidated in 2017 and again last year.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the air cargo carrier went through a rigorous audit by Bureau Veritas according to which its pharma handling facilities and processes were completely re-evaluated.</p>
      <p>With over 8,000 sq m of dedicated pharma storage and handling space, Emirates SkyCargo operates the world's largest multi-airport GDP-certified hubs in Dubai.</p>
      <p>During its 2018/19 financial year, the carrier transported more than 75,000 tonnes of pharmaceuticals across its network.</p>
      <p>In other pharma-related news this week, Rome's Fiumicino (otherwise known as Leonardo da Vinci) airport has become the first air gateway in Italy to gain CEIV Pharma certification from IATA.</p>
      <p>The news was announced at Air Cargo Europe, being held in Munich this week.</p>
      <p>Last month (May), Emirates Group announced that it had faced "significant headwinds" in global airfreight markets during the 2018-19 financial year, which saw Emirates record a 1.4% rise in total airfreight volumes to hit a figure of just under 2.7m tonnes.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the group's cargo handling arm dnata saw near static volumes in 2018-19, edging ahead just 0.3%, to around 3.1m tonnes.</p>

      <p>UPS has announced major upgrades to its healthcare-dedicated warehouse and distribution network in the US and Europe.</p>
      <p>They include adding 1.3m sq ft of total distribution space in key US markets and receiving the European Union's Good Distribution Practice (GDP) compliance certification for its healthcare operations in France and Germany. </p>
      <p>Altogether, the US express parcel and logistics giant's healthcare warehouse and distribution space in the US will total 4m sq ft by 2020.</p>
      <p>Among the largest upgrades include a new 450,000 sq ft facility near the healthcare campus by UPS's Worldport air hub in Louisville. A new centre in Harrisburg will measure 315,000 sq ft and is located near UPS's local transportation hub that has the capability of reaching key northeast markets in one day.</p>
      <p>The centre is also near UPS's Swedesboro healthcare operation which is the first in the UPS network to offer medical device services such as autoclave capabilities, decontamination and replenishment of surgical kits, and instrument inspection.</p>
      <p>Darren Cockrel, UPS president of global logistics, said: "By increasing warehouse and distribution space and optimizing multi-client facilities, our customers have greater opportunity to reduce supply chain costs, and get their shipments to the right places globally at the right time and in full regulatory compliance."</p>
      <p>Other US cities with expanded healthcare warehouse space will include Atlanta, Columbus, Reno and Tracy.</p>
      <p>"We align our healthcare distribution network to deliver a broader 1-2 day coverage, giving customers transit time benefits and later pickups they need to provide competitive advantage," said Dan Gagnon, UPS vice president of global healthcare and life science strategy.</p>
      <p>UPS recently received the EU's GDP certification for pharmaceutical shipping in France and Germany. The GDP healthcare-product distribution guidelines are set by the European Medicines Agency, describing the conditions that a wholesale distributor must meet to ensure the quality and integrity of medicines throughout the supply chain.</p>

    <title>Pharma's New Normal?: the delivery driver is the nurse giving the injection</title>

      <p>A rapidly evolving pharma landscape could see a "New Normal" where the driver delivering vaccines to a patient's home is also the nurse giving the injection. Delegates at the Cool Chain Association (CCA) conference in Brussels heard that shippers and logistics suppliers must share information to build a more secure and efficient pharma supply chain. Cool chain partners need to come out of their data silos to ensure the best service where patients expect tailored products to be delivered to their door, or even administered by a nurse. "There will be a differentiated future – a much broader range of products, a natural split between the very cheap accessible products in the local supermarket and very personal products which are very high value," said Niels van Namen, VP and managing director, healthcare, Europe, UPS. "There will be a much broader range of delivery channels, we are already delivering to the patient at home, and that can mean a nurse giving the injection. The new normal could be the delivery driver is also the nurse giving the injection. "We need to have a physical infrastructure knitted together to make sure the product ends up with the patient, at home, at work, or in the hospital, safely, securely, and in the right condition." Pharma experts taking part in the two-day discussion 6th Pharma and Biosciences Conference all agreed that the cool chain was improving, but that fear of sharing information and embracing new ideas was an issue. "Each part of the chain is doing much better in its own area, but the chain is not there yet, we are not good at sharing information," said pharma logistics expert Yoram Eshel. "Information must be shared between regulators, pharma agencies, forwarders, and all parts of the supply chain so that everyone can learn and improve. My message is do not be afraid to share information. "The pharma industry together with all logistics stakeholders need to work hand in hand in order to improve product integrity and patient health and safety." Delegates agreed that increasing demands from regulators would force the cool chain industry's hand to adopt certification as a "need to have, not a nice to have". Shippers in the audience said certification was already part of their process when choosing a lane. "You also have to start with a proper facility and with training," said Rinzing Wangyal, VP planning North America, Worldwide Flight Services (WFS). He continued: "It is important that we are transparent just as the disruptors are and we should learn from them. Within three or four years all the paper will be gone, and we should focus on this and not fight against e-cargo. "E-commerce is going to give us a lot of opportunities and ideas, and now is the time for us all to work together and work with them." CCA chairman Stavros Evangelakakis said the focus should also be on the last mile, especially in developing countries. "As an industry, starting from the shipper all the way to the patient we should also think about the challenges faced by the people delivering on the last mile through jungles and up mountains," he said. "There are thousands of preventable deaths of infants under five years old every day and we should be part of the solution." Read more Pharma Logistics news</p>

      <p>DHL Global Forwarding has opened a new logistics centre for life science and healthcare products at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.</p>
      <p>The Life Science Competence Center is located next to the airport at the business park Schiphol Southeast. It serves as a hub for the transport, transport preparation, temporary storage, and transport follow-up of active and passive temperature-controlled pharmaceutical and medicinal products.</p>
      <p>The facility covers 1,000 square metres and was part of an investment of one million euros and is run by 14 trained logistics specialists.</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding says the facility is one of the largest and most modern of its kind in the transport sector in the Netherlands. One area is dedicated to pharmaceutical products that must be stored at constant temperatures between two and eight degrees Celsius, while the second one allocated to a controlled temperature range of between 15 to 25 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>There is also special temperature-controlled loading area, with a loading dock for both ULD's and pallets. Actively cooled containers can be charged and dry ice can be replenished.</p>
      <p>The centre is equipped with numerous temperature and humidity sensors that immediately sound an alarm should conditions fall outside of established parameters. The centre also meets the latest safety standards and complies with all European directives that apply to such transportation and storage facilities.</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding global head of life sciences and healthcare, Nigel Wing says: "The life sciences and healthcare industry is regulated by increasingly stricter compliance requirements that stretch beyond the historic boundaries of GMP &amp; GSP (Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Storage Practice).</p>
      <p>"At the same time, dealing with increasingly sensitive pharmaceutical products, often of high value, that have specific handling and temperature tolerances brings new complexity to the supply chain.</p>
      <p>"With its strategic location at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, this new competence center further strengthens our existing temperature-controlled network worldwide. The facility is certified as part of our network of DHL Thermonet stations and allows us to expand and share our knowledge and expertise globally, whilst meeting the high quality levels expected of the life sciences industry."</p>

      <p>Vienna-headquartered freight forwarder cargo-partner held a groundbreaking ceremony yesterday (August 30) as it began construction of a new warehouse near Slovenia's Ljubljana Airport. The iLogistics Center will provide 25,000 sq m of storage space, as well as 6,000 sq m of small parts and single-pick area, 5,000 sq m of cross dock and block storage space and 4,000 sq m of office space. To be furnished with over 20,000 pallet slots and 44 truck docks, the site is located right next to Ljubljana Airport. The iLogistics Center is scheduled to open its doors next year. The groundbreaking event for the facility was organised in co-operation with the Austrian Chamber of Commerce (WKO) and was attended by the director of ADVANTAGE AUSTRIA Ljubljana, Peter Hasslacher, the Slovenian minister of economic development and technology, Zdravko Počivalšek, as well as representatives of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce. Stefan Krauter, chief executive of cargo-partner, and Viktor Kastelic, managing director of cargo-partner in Slovenia, acted as hosts. Speaking at the event, Hasslacher recalled: "cargo-partner has proven again and again to be ambitious, highly successful, reliable and trustworthy". He applauded the company's "significant investment in Slovenia". Krauter explained cargo-partner's thinking behind its commitment in Ljubljana: "We are investing here in Slovenia because we believe that this special location near the ports of Koper and Trieste will remain an important gateway to Asia and the Mediterranean Sea as well as to former Yugoslavia, Transylvania, Hungary, Austria, southern Germany and parts of northern Italy. "We have a very diligent and professional planning phase behind us, which will now be followed by a very productive construction phase. "We want to build something which we can all be proud of and which will be the best recommendation for any logistics requirements in the region," Krauter promised. Kastelic added: "Slovenia is located right at the crossroads between Western and South Eastern Europe – you can't get around it. "In recent years, the state has recognised the opportunities offered by logistics as a strategic industry at the highest levels, and is beginning to make investments to fully utilise this potential. "Our iLogistics Center is just one stone in this mosaic of opportunity." Finally, Počivalšek also pointed to Slovenia's favourable "geostrategic location and its connection to regional market", adding that the country is "gaining importance as a logistical vantage point". He further noted: "This is thanks in a large part to investments like the cargo-partner iLogistics Center, which bring higher added value and follow sustainable principles. "cargo-partner has chosen Brnik, one of the most important entry points, and we sincerely wish for this location to continue to flourish in the future. "This development will be supported by investments made in the area, which will also significantly contribute to the global competitiveness of the Slovenian economy," Počivalšek said. </p>

      <p>CARGO 2000 (C2K) members have agreed new quality standards for the air cargo industry.        More than 60 technical and operational managers took part in a meeting of C2K's Technical Working Group this week as part of a drive to implement new quality standards for the air cargo industry. C2K is an IATA interest group that includes forwarders, airlines, handlers, truckers and IT providers among its membership. The  Technical Working Group met in Vienna to finalise C2K's revised Airport-to-Airport (A2A) specification and kick-start a revision of its Door-to-Door (D2D) process definitions. C2K's audit and certification programme is also being "refreshed" by the working group, ready for a re-launch next year. Ariaen Zimmerman, executive director C2K, said: "The C2K Technical Working Group has taken some important steps this week to improve processes and we are in a strong position to embark on a more detailed revision and update of our current Audit and Certification Programme to ensure it is robust."  At the Vienna meeting, C2K members addressed the final post-implementation issues of the new A2A specification. The document defines the standard processes and measures at air waybill (AWB) level for all movements, from airport at origin to airport at destination adopted by airlines, forwarders and ground handlers. In a statement, C2K said it can now move forward with a revision of its D2D specification, which defines standard processes and measures at house AWB level for all D2D movements adopted by forwarders and trucking companies in the group. A new D2D Task Force, including forwarders, IT companies and airlines will begin revising the specification immediately and will hold its first official meeting in November 2015 in Frankfurt, Germany. "This week's meeting marks an important milestone for C2K as we continue to develop and enhance our processes for the benefit of the air cargo community," said Stephen Smith, vice president senior project manager, DHL Global Forwarding. "The launch of the door-to-door specification revision is integral for DHL Global Forwarding, as it will be the standard to measure the door-to-door performance and improve the air cargo customer experience." The C2K Technical Working Group is also identifying ways to add information to the data it captures in order to measure and report new Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the industry and is developing an implementation plan for this Smart Data project ready for a roll out in 2016. "The Smart Data approach will provide the added value of built-in analysis, added guidance as to where shipment processing time lapses occur and, as such, enhance visibility to identifiable opportunities for improvement," said France Pellerin, manager cargo quality compliance at Air Canada. Most of the projects and activities are planned for implementation in 2016, with the D2D specification due for formal adoption in 2017.

      <p>Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH) is set to be turned into a state-of-the-art global air cargo center of excellence, thanks to a strategic project undertaken by Abu Dhabi Airports and Etihad Cargo.</p>
      <p>Abu Dhabi Airports and the cargo and logistics services arm of the Etihad Aviation Group will implement a multi-phased cargo infrastructure development strategy, starting with the upgrade of Etihad's existing air cargo terminal facilities on the Southside airport perimeters.</p>
      <p>As a result, Eithad Cargo will get a future home, a new state-of-the-art air cargo terminal in the East Midfield section of the airport, an area designated by Abu Dhabi Airports for future integrated cargo, logistics and integrator activities.</p>
      <p>The plan will be implemented in phases. In the first phase, the Southside Etihad cargo facilities will be upgraded and is expected to be completed between fall 2019 and end of Q3 2020. As part of this phase, the RFS loading docks will be enhanced with levelers, insulation and floor works for faster and more efficient loading with stricter temperature controls, increased storage space and additional build-up and breakdown zones to improve production workflow, and upgraded cool chain facilities for both its fresh and pharma handling and storage operations.</p>
      <p>Tony Douglas, group chief executive officer, Etihad Aviation Group, said, "Today's announcement is a major milestone in the development of Etihad Cargo's logistics strategy that will see our hub continue to grow as one of the world's most important trade facilitators connecting East and West. The immediate investment in the Southside terminal will deliver a step change in the efficiency and capability of our existing facilities while the announcement of the development of a new facility reinforces Etihad's commitment to develop Abu Dhabi as a world class hub for the logistics of the future."</p>
      <p>The first phase is expected to increase efficiency and productivity in the existing facilities to support air cargo growth at Abu Dhabi International Airport for the coming five years. It will also enhance Etihad's pharmaceutical logistics capability through a dedicated Southside Pharma Terminal, adding 3,500 square metres of space for temperature-controlled handling and storage across both 2-8 degrees Celsius and 15-25 degrees Celsius categories. This further complements Etihad Cargo's recent success in the domain, having become the first airline in the Middle East to gain CEIV Pharma certification for both its airline and terminal operations in January.</p>
      <p>Abu Dhabi Airports and Etihad Cargo will also designate a plot of land at the East Midfield site, for which they will invite  expressions of interest to bid for the design and construction of Etihad Cargo's state-of-the-art, next generation facility. The facility will be designed to handle incremental UAE import and export demand, boost Etihad's growing cargo network flows as well as cater for the significant rise in E-commerce and express mail and cargo operations.</p>
      <p>Bryan Thompson, chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi Airports, commented, "Geographically, Abu Dhabi is situated at the heart of the east to west trade routes. Additionally, the transport and logistics fabric of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is well planned and structured to create undeniable potential to grow the cargo traffic exponentially. Today we are putting in place the right foundations and frameworks for our future cargo activity, which in a few years will re-shape this industry for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is the future's cargo hub for the region and the world."</p>
      <p>In addition, Abu Dhabi Airports is setting the groundworks for the first phase of a bonded, non-bonded and free zone area adjoining the airport designated as 'Al Falah Free Zone', which it will develop as a prime location for E-commerce fulfilment and Logistics warehousing. The goal is to transform the nation's capital into a globally recognised, multi-modal cargo hub driving sustainable economic growth in the Emirate.</p>

      <p>AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) and Shanghai Pudong International Airport Cargo Terminal Co Ltd (PACTL) have signed up for closer cooperation on time &amp; temperature sensitive shipments, primarily pharmaceutical and healthcare products. The signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will serve as a commitment by both parties to develop, expand, and promote business cooperation in this area, and corresponds to the strategic cooperation agreement between ABC and Shanghai Airport Authority signed in September 2017. Both companies are already IATA CEIV Pharma-certified. A joint statement said that the MoU will concentrate "on the enhancement of operations for pharma shipments by optimizing internal procedures, strengthening personnel skills, and leveraging innovative IT technologies". Sergey Lazarev, general director of ABC, said: "The pharmaceutical sector sets the high level of expectations for all supply chain stakeholders. Understanding the need for high-end services our customers expect us to provide, we work with forward-thinking and trustworthy partners." Christian Haug, Vice President of PACTL, said: "Now it's the right time to collaborate with AirBridgeCargo. PACTL's IATA CEIV has been granted since the very beginning of 2016 and the PACTL Cool Center is the newest contribution to cool chain infrastructure for all temperature sensitive goods in PVG [Shanghai airport]. "The facility is about 3,500 sq m and with the capacity to handle 100,000 tons annually. Meanwhile, PACTL provides integrated, qualified, and reliable cool center solutions, and advocate to eco-friendly concepts to improve the customer values. There's no doubt that PACTL will assist AirBridgeCargo to coordinate with all parties for TTSP shipment handling and storage." Shanghai airport was among ABC's first online stations in China and the company currently operates more than 20 weekly flights. The official signing ceremony was held on the first day of the Air Cargo China 2018 exhibition.

K+N chief information officer Martin Kolbe said: "We are working on seamless data exchange of different systems to drive automation and to minimise manual efforts. "In addition we create new services and interfaces allowing customers to easily connect with K+N. "Applying Big Data and predictive analytics, supply chains can be managed more efficiently and effectively." K+N member of the managing board Gianfranco Sgro added: "The innovation centres in Singapore and Utrecht will boost our digital road map by exploring, applying and deploying leading technologies to manage our customers' supply chains even more efficiently and effectively. "The market for contract logistics services is transforming substantially due to the effects of digitalisation. "With the Innovation Centers we invest in research and new technologies to accelerate this transformation." During the inauguration ceremony in Singapore, the forwarder announced a strategic partnership with global software-industrial provider Honeywell to support its warehouse initiatives. Last week, the forwarder launched a new digital supply chain management platform.  The forwarder's new end-to-end purchase order management service will allow customers to connect with their vendors, their buyers and sellers, Kuehne + Nagel's physical assets and experts, and their cargo flows.

      <p>European freighter operator Cargolux Airlines has renewed its Good Distribution Practice (GDP) qualification for transporting pharmaceuticals after passing the its surveillance audit. Cargolux became the world's first GDP certified airline in January 2014, confirming its compliance with European Union (EU) GDP and World Health Organisation (WHO) requirements for a consistent quality management system across the transportation process. Cargolux's hub at Luxembourg airport as well as 12 other stations within its network are compliant with GDP and/or are also certified to IATA's CEIV Pharma qualification via subcontracted service partners, the ground handling agents. "GDP Certification ensures best practice policies are upheld in the handling and transportation of this sensitive cargo," said Franco Nanna, Cargolux director global logistics services and also chairman of IATA's Time and Temperature Working Group, adding: "Along with the temperature-controlled zones onboard the aircraft, this certification represents additional peace of mind for our customers whose satisfaction is our key priority". The GDP certification programme centers on the use of sophisticated, specialised equipment, well established pharmaceutical working procedures and continuously improving pharmaceutical handling expertise. Stavros Evangelakakis, Cargolux's global product manager for CV Pharma, said: "The demand for specialised transportation of pharmaceuticals has risen considerably over the past few years and Cargolux's dedicated product CV Pharma is in increasing demand. "There is growing market interest for these products in South America and Africa although the majority of the supply is still flown from Europe to North America, North East Asia and the Gulf region."

      <p>Germany's biggest airfreight carrier, Lufthansa Cargo, has been chosen as an 'anchor partner' of global technology accelerator Plug and Play. Based in Sunnyvale, California, Plug and Play describes itself as the world's largest technology accelerator, working to bring technology start-ups and relevant companies together. The goal is to combine forces to further develop and quickly implement new digital solutions, and Plug and Play's programme provides the opportunity for players in the logistics industry to network with and learn from each other, exchange ideas and drive digitisation. "By working with start-ups, we get to try out innovative ideas and new technology," said Lufthansa Cargo's head of digital transformation, Boris Hueske. "These innovations might be the basis for new services for our customers or process optimisations. They are a major factor in the digitisation of logistics." Having Lufthansa Cargo as one of its supply chain anchor partners represents a "perfect fit for our ecosystem of industry-leading corporate partners", added founder of Plug and Play Supply Chain &amp; Logistics Mike Zayonc. "Having partners like Lufthansa Cargo, ExxonMobil, Panasonic, DHL, Prologis, the United States Postal Service, Ericsson, Maersk, and BASF working together to collaborate with the most advanced technologies is a perfect venue to digitally transform any global fortune 500 company's end-to-end supply chain." Fleet of foot In January this year it was revealed that Lufthansa Cargo was one of a number of companies that had invested in start-up logistics marketplace Fleet Logistics Inc. Fleet was founded in 2014 and serves as an online marketplace, matching demand for freight services with available capacity from logistics companies. The investment will see Lufthansa Cargo chief commercial officer Alexis von Hoensbroech take a seat on Fleet's board of directors. The air cargo carrier stated: "By acquiring shares in Fleet Logistics, Lufthansa Cargo underlines its strategic commitment in lifting the airfreight industry to a superior digital maturity level. "The acquisition is part of the Lufthansa Group's overall digitisation strategy and was strongly supported by the Lufthansa Innovation Hub in Berlin."</p>

      <p>Young professionals from six logistics companies in the Netherlands have taken part in a new programme aimed at developing talent and improving collaboration across the airfreight supply chain. Each of them – from Air France KLM Martinair Cargo, Jan De Rijk Logistics, Tosoh Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Agility and Swissport – visited each other's places of work to gain a better understanding of processes and to explore new ways of improving co-operation. The initiative was launched by The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA), with the help of Air Cargo Netherlands (the industry association for the air cargo business in The Netherlands), as part of TIACA's commitment to training and supporting a new generation of air cargo leaders. "This initiative will hopefully be the start of many more to follow, where we can develop young talent to be the leaders of tomorrow," said Sebastiaan Scholte, vice chairman of TIACA and chief executive of Dutch road feeder services provider Jan de Rijk Logistics, which is headquartered in Roosendaal in the Netherlands. "It is a unique programme as it involves a vertical integration of the supply chain with complete openness and transparency," Scholte informed. "It is more and more difficult to discover and develop talent, especially in small and medium-sized companies," he opined. "Ideally, we would like to see this develop into an internship scheme, so we not only prepare our future talent, but also improve co-operation in the supply chain." "We have gained understanding for each of the partners' activities in the air cargo supply chain," said Jeroen Leemans, a sales manager with Jan de Rijk Logistics, who participated in the initiative last week. "What we have found is that by working closely together there is a lot to gain every step of the way. "Currently we optimise our own processes and we do a good job, but issues arise around the transfer of information as well as the physical hand-over process. "For the air cargo supply chain to grow, we need to understand how to work better together with our partners," Leemans remarked. TIACA's Education and Research Committee members will be discussing possible next steps for the scheme at their coming board meeting. The association has also developed a Professional Development Workshop Program aimed at growing the management skills of air cargo professionals. The next workshop takes place in Anchorage, Alaska, between August 29 and September 1 this year. The program is designed to offer participants an appreciation of the air cargo supply chain and its component parts by encouraging discussion and the sharing of perspectives, as well as provide practical advice and insight.</p>

      <p>GMR Hyderabad Airport Cargo has launched a "first of its kind" cargo charter programme that offers enhanced services for its members as it continues to target the market.</p>
      <p>The airport's Hyderabad Cargo Charter Circle (HC3) platform will provide additional free cargo storage time; single point of contact for all aspects related to cargo handling; priority storage allocation and end-to-end logistics support within the terminal.</p>
      <p>"GMR Hyderabad Airport Cargo has taken a strategic step to develop Hyderabad as an Air Charter Hub for the South [of India] and boost the regional direct connectivity and link it to the main hubs across the globe," the airport said.</p>
      <p>SGK Kishore, chief executive, GMR Hyderabad Airport Cargo Limited (GHAL), said: "Cargo Charters in India as a concept is still in a nascent phase. It contributes a small proportion of the volume handled by the Indian airports currently, but as an emerging market, cargo charters holds a lot of promise.</p>
      <p>"Realising this potential, we have launched the HC3 platform, which will act as an industry forum led by Hyderabad Airport to give the value add and advantage to this segment of the industry and help boost trade and logistics."</p>
      <p>The airport said that it had seen growing demand for charter flights covering pharma, engineering goods, telecoms, defence and aerospace shipments.</p>
      <p>It handles around 150,000 tonnes of cargo per year and also houses India's first Pharma Zone, which is World Health Organization's Good Storage and Distribution Practices (GSDP) certified and offers end-to-end temperature-controlled environment from the Truck-Dock to the airside.</p>
      <p>"In line with the Govt. of India's vision, GHIAL is progressively working towards making Hyderabad as a strong cargo hub," the operator said.</p>
      <p>"It has been the airport's continuous endeavour to create requisite infrastructure facilities to rally towards this goal.</p>
      <p>"Growing at the pace of double digit cargo growth historically, Hyderabad International Airport has been taking steps towards expanding the existing facilities, adding new infrastructure, transhipment facilities, integrated express terminal, dedicated perishable facilities, pack houses and a strong network – international and domestic (air and road), multimodal connectivity and ease of operations in the air cargo terminals.</p>
      <p>"GMR Group, with its Hyderabad and Delhi Airports, is working towards contributing to the country's vision of becoming [one of] the top five airfreight markets by 2025."</p>

      <p>Kuehne + Nagel (K+N) has expanded its global perishables network with the acquisition of sector specialist forwarders Commodity Forwarders Inc. (CFI) in the US and Trillvane in Kenya. Switzerland-based K+N said that the two acquisitions would add more than 150,000 tons of annual perishables traffic to its network and "further strengthens its position in providing end-to-end international and domestic fresh chain solutions". Yngve Ruud, a member of the of K+N International management board responsible for airfreight logistics, said: "At the same time, we improve our global and national positioning in airfreight. Together with CFI, K+N becomes the number two airfreight forwarder in the US and the acquisition of Trillvane confirms our leading position in Kenya." CFI — established in 1974 by Alfred Kuehlewind as one-man office in Los Angeles shipping strawberries to Europe — today operates 14 locations throughout the US, including Alaska and Hawaii, with more than 700 employees. The company is specialised in airfreight export and import as well as the distribution of seafood, agricultural products, flowers and greens. CFI chief executive Kuehlewind said: "We are looking forward to become part of the K+N Group. The planned transaction will offer us new growth perspectives and access to a global logistics network. Both companies' customers will benefit from an extended service scope." K+N said that the acquisition of Trillvane will enable the logistics giant to "strengthen its position in perishables operations between Kenya and Europe, in particular to the UK". It continued: "With its 130 employees Trillvane is specialised in the export of flowers and vegetables. Its location at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi provides easy and quick access to all major airlines allowing for later cut-offs and shorter transit times leading to both cost savings and optimal handling of temperature sensitive goods." All parties agreed not to disclose the purchase price. Both transactions are subject to customary closing conditions and to clearance by the competent merger control authorities. Ruud added: "The two acquisitions mark another important step in our global perishable logistics strategy. These two transactions further strengthen and expand our fresh chain network connecting key production countries to major consumer markets. "The business potential in the steadily growing global perishable sector is huge. Based on our dedicated network – by now the largest in the logistics industry for perishables – and globally integrated IT systems we can scale business opportunities and accelerate our growth in this sector with end-to-end transparency." Another European mega-forwarder, Panalpina of Switzerland, in May this year bought family-owned Air Connection, a Kenya-based perishables specialist in the export of flowers and vegetables. That deal came two years after Panalpina increased its presence in Kenyan flower logistics by acquiring perishables specialist Airflo, Kenya's second largest airfreight forwarder, and only two weeks after Panalpina formally announced the launch of its global Perishables Network.

    <content>
      <p>Number of companies using slot booking app, BRUcloud, installed at the Brussels Airport, has increased twofold to 15, recently.</p>
      <p>BRUcloud, the cloud-based data sharing slot booking app was installed at the Brussels Airport on January 15. At that point, about seven companies subscribed to BRUcloud.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the number of companies using the app doubled, with eight additional extra firms adopted the application in their live operations.</p>
      <p>The slot booking app eliminates one of the most compelling problems — waiting and idle times at the facilities of ground handlers.</p>
      <p>The app maintains the balance between supply and demand of time slots, thereby streamlining the pick-up and delivery of freight by ground handlers, which leads to a better capacity utilisation, and eliminates peaks and idle-times.</p>
      <p>The tool offers the booker (for example forwarder) to request a single or recurrent time slot at a specific facility, through a central Web-application for all ground handlers.</p>
      <p>Concurrently, the supplier (for example ground handler) can make time slots for different cargo types, which is available through the Web interface or a system-to-system link, with its internal slot management system.</p>
      <p>The slot booking application is available to stakeholders at BRUcargo through the open data sharing platform RUcloud. The application has been developed in a flexible way, so it can be used for any other limited resource or by any cargo community facing the same problems, be it an airport or a seaport. After using the application for more than two months now, the users from wave 1 are absolutely positive.</p>
      <p>"WFS is supporting this overall project. We strongly believe in the positive effects of the use of the slot booking app. The first GO LIVE was a success. Participants within WFS were more than ever enthusiastic about the further roll out of the app," said Eddy Myngheer, general manager Belgium, WFS.</p>
      <p>David Bellon, airfreight director, DHL Global Forwarding said: "The slot booking app ensures an improved planning of resources, and reduces the waiting time during peak periods in air cargo delivery and pick-up value chain. DHL is convinced it's a milestone, which will provide transparency, and an improved handling process at various cargo pick-up and delivery stations. It's only a first step towards further digitisation of our industry, moreover at the Brussels Airport."</p>
      <p>Jeff Segers from IFA Skyfast said: "During the initial days of the launch of the app, Skyfast could eliminate a lots of waiting time at the ground handler's facilities. Similarly, we were able to deploy our staff more efficiently than before."</p>
      <p>After the launch of the first release in January, new partners showed interest to get on board.</p>
      <p>"Over last few months, we had held meetings with all interested parties to demonstrate the application, and inform them on how to become a part of the user group," said Sara Van Gelder, cargo development manager and in charge of the digitalisation projects, BRUcargo.</p>
      <p>"This has resulted in eight additional companies, which is using the application currently, while more parties are in the pipeline," said Gelder.</p>
      <p>"This application is just a part of the landside management tool, which we are developing at Brussels. We will not only continue to improve and develop this app based on feedback of our users, but later this year, additional application will be launched that will interact and share data with the slot booking app," said Steven Polmans, head of cargo &amp; logistics, Brussels Airport.</p>
      <p>Aviapartner, WFS, DHL GF, Nippon Express, Kuehne+Nagel, Panalpina and IFA Skyfast, are the list of companies that joined in January.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Saco Group Air, MSE, Bollore, WFS Forwarding, DB Schenker, CEVA Logistics, Yusen Logistics and DSV, are the other eight companies who joined recently.</p>

      <p>To meet the increasing demand, Yusen Logistics Benelux is further expanding its pharma facilities. Adjacent to the existing warehouse, Yusen will construct an efficient, sustainable and semi-automated 17-metre-high warehouse. This new warehouse will have an ambient temperature level (15-25°C) and a storage capacity of more than 13,000 pallets and it will fully comply with the European GDP regulations for storage and handling of pharmaceutical products.</p>
      <p>The construction of the new warehouse will be directed by Takenaka Europe GmbH, Belgium Branch, in collaboration with local construction companies and suppliers. This complex project will take more than a year to realise. Preparations have already started: delivery and commissioning of the warehouse are planned for December 2020. The daily logistics operations on the Yusen Antwerp Logistics Campus will continue as normal. In order to support growth in the interim, Yusen has secured an additional temporary warehouse capacity of approximately 10,000 square metre in the city of Bornem.</p>
      <p>The new 'smart warehouse' will operate almost completely autonomously: it will feature a 'narrow aisle racking' installation with induction-driven, unmanned trucks that locate the correct pallet through sensor-controlled positioning. This automation brings the great advantage that the warehouse will be operational 24x7, and it can be deployed extremely flexible. It also allows maximum throughput speed of pallets with minimum human error, reducing the risk of damage and accidents.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Yusen Logistics Benelux opened its Antwerp Healthcare Center on Yusen's Antwerp Logistics Campus. The 8,000 square metre GDP-certified pharma warehouse, equipped with both cold store (2-8 °C) and ambient storage (15-25°C), soon reached its maximum storage capacity.</p>
      <p>With the new warehouse included, Yusen Logistics has approximately 65,000 square metre of warehouse capacity on its Antwerp Logistics Campus. The various warehouses on the campus are specifically designed for the storage of products from customers in the automotive, hi-tech, retail &amp; fashion and pharma &amp; healthcare industries. For the latter in particular, the Yusen campus offers extensive GDP-certified facilities, including conditioned storage facilities at various temperature levels, freezer units, narcotics units and spaces for value-added services such as quality control.</p>
      <p>Bruno Jacques, MD of Yusen Logistics Benelux commented: "This new project underlines our strategy to further develop the pharma and healthcare activities in Europe. We offer our customers extra value in their logistics chain through an increased focus on quality, lead times, service offering and cost-efficiency. We are grateful to our customers for their confidence in our services and for trusting us with their products. I look forward to working with all the parties involved to make this new project a huge success!"</p>
      <p>The Antwerp Logistics Campus is a strategic hotspot for Yusen Logistics – at the Benelux and European levels for import and export flows, worldwide air and sea freight in combination with extensive road network connections for transit to destinations throughout Europe.</p>

The suite of services covers the entire value chain from inbound to manufacturing facilities through to final distribution to end users and provides end-to-end visibility of products, full compliance with international regulations and maximum security of sensitive and high-value goods. The semiconductor industry is undergoing significant change and demand is increasing due to digitisation and the 'Internet of Things'. After moderate growth in 2016, market revenue is expected to grow by 16.8% – surpassing the US$400bn mark for the first time – driven mainly by shortages in the memory segment of the market. DHL's said its new suite of semiconductor logistics services would improve the flexibility and agility of semiconductor supply chains. President of DHL's technology sector, Rob Siegers, explained: "With more than 3,000 dedicated employees and 50 facilities worldwide, we have built extensive infrastructure and expertise for the semiconductor industry. "With our new offer, we connect DHL's broad capabilities, enabling us to individually service our customers along their complete supply chain in a cost-efficient way. This becomes crucial for an industry that requires special logistics to be a competitive differentiator." DHL says its new semiconductor teams are experienced in the unique handling and transportation requirements of the industry and offer round-the-clock proactive monitoring supported by a specifically designed IT solution leveraging the latest technical developments. Intel's general manager of the internet of things, industrial &amp; energy, smart building division, Christine Boles, stated: "The support and insight provided by DHL as we developed the Intel Connected Logistics Platform has been very valuable. "Our logistics operations have in turn been providing input into the development of DHL's Global Capital Support Center. We look forward to reaping the rewards of a more advanced transportation visibility solution and a support center designed specifically for capital shipments."</p>

      <p>Cloud application provider Infor and global trade management solution provider Integration Point have teamed up to deliver a new global trade management product on a single shared information network. The solution will integrate elements such as logistics, trade finance, trade compliance, trade content, customs filing and duty optimisation, allowing end-to-end connectivity, visibility and collaboration with all parties in the supply chain. The combination of Integration Point's trade content and compliance data with transactions managed on Infor's GT Nexus Commerce Network helps importers and exporters comply with the various trade regulations and filing requirements pertaining to their operations. Tom Barnes, CEO of Integration Point, said: "Connectivity with trading partners and regulatory agencies, together with localised knowledge, enables our customers to stay ahead of changing regulatory requirements. This combined solution enables customers to conduct automated due diligence for 206 countries and territories before and during the transaction lifecycle, streamlining document creation and customs clearance – thereby reducing cycle times and risk." According to Kurt Cavano, president of the Infor GT Nexus Commerce Network: "Trade compliance becomes more strategic when you connect it directly to your supply chain processes. Companies often experience cargo delays due to inefficient systems and processes, or overpay in duties because they're not set up to take advantage of programs or systems that can reduce their net fees." A statement said that the global trade management capabilities are "part of a broader suite of supply chain management solutions offered by Infor, including warehouse management, supply chain planning, supplier collaboration, and procure to pay automation".</p>

      <p>Airline Emirates SkyCargo has revealed that next month it will begin offering "dedicated" pharma flights from London and Frankfurt. Speaking at an event organised by the airline and new partner SkyCell, Emirates SkyCargo manager global sales pharma Julian Sutch said that where applicable it would begin to group pharma shipments on certain flights to further mitigate the risk of temperature deviation. The first specialist pharma flights will take off from Heathrow and Frankfurt and will be timed to land in Dubai during the evening when the temperature is cooler. The service will be rolled out to other destinations in the future. Sutch said grouping shipments onto certain flights will result in increased focus on the special requirements of pharma shipments at ground handlers and on the ramp. Handlers will also be able to better plan for arrival. "Out of London, one flight a day will be consolidated and all the pharma will fly on that flight," said Sutch. "That results in more focus from the ground handler and the pilots and there won't be hundreds of different products underneath where you could have varying temperatures. "We can only really do this when we have multiple frequencies per day, or depending on the volume of cargo coming out, we can do it on certain flights in the week. "Some airlines have only one flight a day and so they are restricted as to what they can put on that aircraft and how they segregate it but we will never put a fish pallet next to a pharma pallet, we will put them on separate flights." Sutch said that when weekly pharma flights are introduced, shippers may be required to change the day of export if they want to benefit from the specialist flights. So far shippers had been receptive to the idea: "They were willing to change the day they export from their manufacturing sites to match the flights that we have. So when we got the all clear from a number of shippers, we thought let's role with this project." He said around 80% of cargo on the flights would be pharma products. "In any aircraft only one of the holds is temperature controlled, so in that hold that is temperature controlled it will be pretty much close to 100% pharma," he said. Sutch added that it had also split out its pharma product into three different packages − SkyPharma, SkyPharma Plus and SkyPharma Active. Each would target different value products and offer various levels of protection. For instance, SkyPharma Active offers prioritised ground handling, quick ramp transportation, temperature controlled storage and active containers. SkyPharma offers quick ramp transport and temperature-controlled storage for products in passive packaging and shipper supplied thermal covers. Sutch also spoke of the benefits of teaming up with SkyCell to offer its semi-passive temperature controlled containers, which have the ability to re-charge when in certain temperature zones. He said that many destinations had a shortage of dry ice and cool rooms and therefore having a product that could recharge along the journey, had five-times more energy storage than active containers and do not require batteries or dry ice was extremely beneficial for shippers.  "A solution like this can re-charge in a 2-8 degrees Celsius facility and then if it is kicked out for two days because of a lack of capacity it can continue to keep products cool." SkyCell's chief executive Richard Ettl added that its rental customers would benefit from Emirates' global reach and consistent performance. Read more freighter operator news</p>

      <p>Rodolfo Marré, product development senior manager for LATAM Cargo says: "We understand that minimal deviation from the defined temperature ranges can greatly affect the quality of the products and that is why we are constantly evaluating new options for our Clients. CSafe containers offer cutting-edge technology that will continue to strengthen our PHARMA ACTIVE Product."</p>
      <p>Brad Jennings, vice president of global marketing and partner alliances for CSafe Global says: "With a comprehensive cargo network serving key markets in the Latin American region, and a robust CEIV pharma programme, we look forward to a very fruitful collaboration with LATAM Cargo as we collectively strive to best serve pharma companies seeking that ultimate peace of mind when transporting invaluable life-enhancing medications to their patients in the increasingly important pharma market across Latin America."</p>

      <p>Today, Swissport announced its plans to develop a new pharmaceutical center at Brussels Airport (BRU).</p>
      <p>Swissport's pharmaceutical center will provide 25,000 square meters of warehouse space, offices and 3,620 square meters of space for temperature-sensitive biopharmaceutical products. The warehouse space will include an automated Material Handling System (MHS), 50 truck loading bays, "speed gates" for air cargo and a four-story office building. Meanwhile, the space for specialized pharmaceuticals will include a 1,000 square meter cooling facility for products needing cooling between 2° to 8°C , and will more than triple Swissport's ambient pharma space at the airport from 800 square meters to 2,620 square meters that can hold goods requiring cooling between 15° to 25°C.  t.</p>
      <p>Swissport said it signed a long-term agreement with BRU for the space and will invest several million euros in the pharma facility, which will be housed in a new building BRU is currently constructing. No further details related to the timeline of construction and operation have yet been announced.</p>
      <p>The new facilities fit with Swissport's other moves toward growth over the past few months, with expansions at hubs across Europe. The company opened a second air cargo warehouse at Vienna International Airport (VIE) in late June, and purchased the remaining shares in Heathrow Cargo Handling Ltd. (HCH) in February.</p>
      <p>The company's turn towards pharma is no shock either, as carriers across the industry have built up their capacities for sensitive cargo in recent months.</p>
      <p>AirBridgeCargo, United Cargo and SIA Cargo all signed leases with SkyCell for temperature-controlled containers last month. Emirates SkyCargo similarly expanded its pharma capacity in June, when it added eight stations to its pharma corridor network. FedEx Express also launched a temperature-controlled cold chain shipping solution for the Asia-Pacific region to address increased shipping demands in the health industry earlier this spring.</p>

      <p>Kale Logistics Solutions has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Cargonaut, an established cargo community service provider based in the Netherlands to create a digital air freight corridor between the two countries that will enhance shipment visibility and optimise flow of cargo data.</p>
      <p>In the first of its kind, Mumbai airport, India and Schiphol airport, Netherlands along with their partners for Cargo Community systems, Kale Logistics Solutions and Cargonaut have pioneered an initiative towards creating a digital air corridor between India and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Through this initiative, the collaboratively created digital corridor will facilitate flow of information within the stakeholder chain and optimise cargo visibility across the stakeholder network. Following the signing, both companies will collaboratively develop a shared interface between their respective air cargo community systems. This interface shall be capable of facilitating exchange of cargo status at each individual location, followed by interchange of actual shipment data.</p>
      <p>At any time, participants of the network will be in full control of their data. This pioneering initiative will help to reduce unnecessary administrative paperwork involved in shipment movement between the two countries, thus strengthening and easing cargo and data movement. This will enable both the countries to experience ease of shipment data exchange.</p>
      <p>Amar More, CEO, Kale Logistics Solutions CEO Amar More says: "Kale Logistics has always been at the forefront of driving trade facilitation across the logistics and supply chain sector. With this signing, we have reaffirmed our interest to contribute in initiatives that are imperative to drive ease of doing business and efficiency across the logistics &amp; supply chain sector. Collaborating with an accomplished partner like Cargonaut, has certainly given us an edge to extend our Trade Facilitation initiatives across Europe. We are very optimistic that this collaboration will set a benchmark for more such initiatives in the future."</p>
      <p>Nanne Onland, CEO, Cargonaut adds: "The collaboration between Kale Logistics and Cargonaut fits perfectly in our mutual aim to create a Network of Trusted Networks. Together we can establish a 'virtual' platform for our joined customers in India and The Netherlands. trade facilitation initiatives like these are the way to the future in which airport communities, together with governments work closely together to improve, speed-up and simplify the air cargo business for all involved."</p>

      <p>American Airlines Cargo is to implement a next generation cargo management system in its largest investment to date. The US carrier has selected IBS Software to implement iCargo, which will see American migrate to a web-based, fully integrated technology platform connecting all of its critical business functions. Said an airline spokesperson: "Together, American and IBS are designing a multi-year, phased implementation and rollout strategy, which ensures the new technology and processes are brought into the business in a seamless manner. "The carrier is committed to taking an iterative approach to this implementation to ensure day-to-day business functions run smoothly during the transition, minimising the impact go-live will have on partners and customers." The result, added the spokesperson, will be new technology and streamlined processes that give American the agility necessary to stay at the forefront of the industry. Rick Elieson, president, American Airlines Cargo, said: "We will continue to push the boundaries to deliver an industry-leading experience. "We are focused on modernising processes for our team, and increasing transparency and flexibility for our customers. The rapidly changing cargo landscape demands that we invest in the best of tools, so that our team can focus on doing what they do best — delivering an exceptional customer experience." VK Mathews, executive chairman, IBS Group,said: "iCargo has, over the years, recorded remarkable traction in the market to emerge as the most definitive cargo management solution in the air transportation industry. "The iCargo footprint is now truly global and having American among our growing list of customers is indeed a strategic milestone for IBS. The engagement, I am sure, will herald the beginning of a long and productive business relationship."  Read more cargo Airline and Technology news</p>

      <p>LATAM Cargo, MVD Free Airport and Brussels Airport have worked together to launch a GDP-compliant route between the Belgian capital and Montevideo.</p>
      <p>Following the need to service the growing needs of a burgeoning regional distribution center for pharmaceutical products in Montevideo, Uruguay, LATAM Cargo is increasing its global reach adding a new destination. The new BRU-MVD route will start in September 2018. It is designed to attend to the demand of global pharmaceutical companies seeking to optimise entry to South America via Uruguay given its benefits in terms of quality, security and the reduction of overall lead times.</p>
      <p>"We are very excited about this first step LATAM Cargo is taking, understanding the shipper's and forwarder's demands and providing the enhanced connectivity to attend via Uruguay large emerging markets such as Brazil and Argentina," says LATAM Cargo senior sales manager Germany, Benelux, Switzerland &amp; Austria Jorge Carretero. "We are confident this is only the first step of many and it is a clear symbol of LATAM Cargo's commitment towards leading the enhancement of pharma distribution in the region."</p>
      <p>MVD Free Airport managing director Bruno Guello says: "The market is increasingly asking for this solution. We are in touch with dozens of shippers that consider MVD Free Airport for their regional distribution given its multimodal capabilities, the possibility to reach large markets quicker and more cost-efficiently as well as to manage their stock more efficiently, performing several late customization activities from a GDP-compliant, state-of-the-art infrastructure. LATAM Cargo has seen the opportunity lying ahead, and now helps to improve the connectivity with Europe, one of the main pharma origin markets."</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport cargo and product development manager and chairman of Pharma.Aero Nathan De Valck, says: "It is very satisfying for Brussels Airport to be the outbound gateway for this initiative, and for Pharma.Aero to have helped in connecting some of the key players in its development."</p>
      <p>LATAM Cargo has scheduled the first flight for the first week of September 2018.</p>

      <p>Cargo 2000 (C2K) has rebranded as Cargo iQ as part of a strategic transformation programme including a Smart Data Project, and a new audit and certification scheme.</p>
      <p>New members have also joined up and add to the 82 already part of the group. They are Emirates SkyCargo, Brussels Airport, Vienna International Airport, CargoAware and Fraport.</p>
      <p>The rebranding is part of a change programme and was revealed at the International Air Transport Association's World Cargo Symposium in Berlin today.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo announced it has joined the organisation as a full member for the first time after having had an observer on the board for the past year.</p>
      <p>CargoiQ executive director, Ariaen Zimmerman says: "Cargo iQ members work together to measure success and continuously improve the value of airfreight for customers.</p>
      <p>"We have successfully developed a system with clear milestones and unique route maps, and thanks to our reliable monitoring, members can improve their services to customers.</p>
      <p>"Our new Smart Data Project will add 110 million lines of performance data annually, allowing our members to further improve their processes and adding more value to the air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>"We are excited to embark on this next chapter of our work, which benefits the whole industry, with innovative ideas and new members."</p>
      <p>Emirates divisional senior vice president of cargo, Nabil Sultan says with the rebranding and the launch of the strategic transformation programme, the carrier felt that the time was right to become a member.</p>
      <p>Ten million airport-to-airport and 5.5 million door-to-door shipments were measured by Cargo iQ in 2015, enabling members to take action to improve and standardise internal processes by identifying where quality was an issue.</p>
      <p>This year, the group will implement a new audit and certification scheme, which is focused on giving the Cargo iQ Quality Management System Certification higher international recognition.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport head of cargo, Steven Polmans tells Air Cargo Week it has been talking with the group for six years about joining, but felt the time was right to sign up when the rebranding and changes were announced.</p>
      <p>He says the gateway had been separately talking to other European airports about sharing statistics and data, but this was the best option and feels the sharing of data between the different members of the supply chain will only help enhance cargo efficiency and operations and drive growth at Brussels.</p>

      <p>Ground handler Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) has been awarded IATA CEIV Pharma certification for its new €10m pharma centre at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.</p>
      <p>Opened in September last year, the 2,400 sq m centre is the only dedicated facility at the airport and almost 30 airlines and freight forwarders are already using it. The company expects the centre to handle over 8,000 tonnes of products in 2020.</p>
      <p>Hugo Rodrigues, vice president cargo France at WFS, said: "Gaining IATA CEIV Pharma certification so soon after opening the Centre recognises our intention to meet the highest industry standards. It also adds to Paris CDG's reputation as one of the world's leading air cargo gateways.</p>
      <p>"Investing in the Pharma Centre supports WFS' strategy to broaden our product offering by supporting the needs of both our airline and forwarding customers as well as their customers, which, in this case, are major pharmaceutical companies that demand the highest standards of compliance to protect the integrity of their products."</p>
      <p>WFS has been investing in pharma handling centres at locations around its network. In 2019, this included the opening of other facilities in Copenhagen, Johannesburg, Miami and New York JFK.</p>
      <p>In a release, WFS also highlighted the main capabilities offered by the Paris center.</p>
      <p>It said it is located at the airport's cargo area, has landside and airside access, boasts three temperature controlled rooms each offering loose cargo storage at a range of temperatures, two storage areas with a controlled temperate of 2-25 degrees Celsius, digital systems to improve visibility, barcode scanning tech, a temperature monitoring station, temperature controlled dollies and trailers and a cloud-based incident platform.</p>

      <p>The air cargo community should drive its own standards for perishables and not wait for other groups and agencies to supply them, says Cool Chain Association (CCA) chairman, Stavros Evangelakakis.</p>
      <p>A lack of accountability is contributing to 1.3 billion tonnes of food being wasted along the supply chain every year, about one third of all food produced, delegates heard at the CCA's "World Without Food Waste – what can air cargo deliver?" conference in Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>Collaboration, transparency and data sharing as well as training for perishable growers and better facilities are needed to improve quality in the fragmented and disconnected supply chain, speakers explained at the two-day event.</p>
      <p>Evangelakakis, who is also global product manager healthcare and perishable at Cargolux, says: "We should aim for quality, we should not wait for other agencies to come up with standards, we should look internally and act now. A standard in perishables should be something akin to the standards in pharmaceuticals, and over the next two years as Chairman I am going to push for that."</p>
      <p>He asks: "Are you ready for collaboration?"</p>
      <p>Keynote speaker Philippe Schuler, a food waste prevention consultant and CCA researcher in perishable cool chains says the information needed for the supply chain to make improvements is already there.</p>
      <p>He says: "The information needs to be made accessible. When we all start to have access to the data, we can start to solve the problems."</p>
      <p>Schuler was commissioned to undertake a "farm to fork" study of papayas from Brazil to Europe looking into waste in perishable logistics, which is called "Papayas – studying waste in perishable logistics" and is available to CCA members.</p>
      <p>COLEACP director of operations, Jeremy Knops says collaboration could drive change and the supply chain is only part of the issue.</p>
      <p>He says: "By showing more producers practical examples, working with leaders, for example, from the transport industry, we can make a very positive impact. The key word is to look for partnerships, this has to be a joint effort, not only because of the waste, but because of the potential for agriculture to go one way or another."</p>
      <p>The CCA held its Annual General Meeting as part of the event, formally welcoming Perishable Products Export Control Board general manager, Vijan Chetty as a board member, and formally electing Air France KLM Cargo and Martinair Cargo global head of perishables director verticals, Eric Mauroux as treasurer.</p>
      <p>Xtreme Technology chief executive officer (CEO), Edwin Kalischnig was re-elected secretary general.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport Company cargo and product development manager, Nathan de Valck and Jan de Rijk Logistics CEO, Sebastiaan Scholte stepped down from the board.</p>

      <p>Korean Air has implemented a new cargo management system, named iCargo, as it continues with its IT renewal programme.</p>
      <p>The iCargo internet platform, which will replace the existing 35-year-old system, combines the full scope of end-to-end cargo business functions of Korean Air – reservation, sales, terminal operation, revenue accounting, cargo portal and more – in a single, integrated system.</p>
      <p>Around 130 domestic and overseas stations have so far seamlessly implemented the system over approximately "two years of intensive preparation".</p>
      <p>"The next-generation cargo system, based on cloud technology, is part of our digital transformation of the future. Launched in April, the new system will lead change and further enhance the quality of customer service in the fiercely competitive cargo industry," said Sam Noh, Senior Vice President &amp; Head of Cargo Business Division of Korean Air.</p>
      <p>The airline, which operates a fleet of 23 freighters, was able to implement the system following its 2018 partnership with IBS Software.</p>
      <p>"iCargo, has the most notable advantage when it comes to customer convenience," the airline said. "It enables the company to provide consistent service through an integration of sales-reservation-operation systems. It also provides up-to-date information via customized monitoring function and tracks the status of shipments in real-time through e-mail or SMS, depending on the customer's preference."</p>
      <p>Korean Air will continue to develop its software functionality through to March 202o when the airline will also introduce an AI-based Cargo RMS (Revenue Management System) solution, which is expected to improve company profitability.</p>
      <p>"Taking steps to migrate its entire IT system to Cloud by 2021, Korean Air will continue with its digital transformation to cope with rapid developments in the business environment," the company said. "By dramatically improving customer experience, Korean Air will further strengthen its position as a leading carrier in the global cargo industry."</p>

      <p>Amerijet has become the first US-based all-cargo airline to be awarded IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV) Pharma certification. Vic Karjian, president and chief executive of Amerijet International Airlines, said: "This certification reconfirms our commitment to offering the highest consistent quality, professionalism and transparency to our customers. "Being the first all-cargo airline from the US to receive the CEIV in pharmaceutical logistics is a direct result of hard work and the investments we have made over the last few years to our temperature controlled (ATC) program." Amerijet operates its own dedicated freighter fleet of Boeing 767-300/200 aircraft from its primary hub at the Miami International Airport to 38 destinations throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America. The airline transports over 136,000 tonnes of freight annually, including 30,000 tonnes of temperature controlled products. Amerijet's temperature controlled handling facility at Miami airport includes a custom-built cooling facility equipped with active alarm systems, temperature data recorders and 24/7 CCTV monitoring. Computer monitored pharmaceutical cooling chambers provide storage environments for ambient 15°C – 25°C, chilled at 2°C – 8°C, and frozen at -0°C shipments. The carrier is to launch a twice a week direct Boeing 767 freighter service to Brussels, a key European pharma hub, in the second quarter of 2018. Rasheme Richardson, vice president of airport operations for Amerijet added: "As an airline, our role in the supply chain is to provide safe handling and to ensure temperature integrity for all pharmaceutical shipments. "We demand the same uniform standards and processes from all of our business partners, including our handlers and trucking companies. "Complying with the healthcare cold chain logistics standards, expected from pharmaceutical manufacturers and life sciences companies, helps to support the global healthcare initiative of putting patient safety first." Glyn Hughes, IATA global head of cargo, said: "Amerijet's strategy to enhance its pharma shipping offering through investing in the latest cold chain technology and joining the IATA CEIV Pharma certification program demonstrates the airline's commitment to patient safety. "We congratulate Amerijet for their achievement in meeting shippers' expectations in terms of standardization and transparency. This will contribute towards developing a stronger, more competitive and enhanced air cargo service for pharmaceuticals in North and Latin America for this vital sector." Amerijet's global network reaches 476 destinations in Europe, Asia, Pacific, South Africa and the Middle East. Within the US, Canada and Mexico, Amerijet partners with local asset-based carriers to provide full truckload, less-than-truckload and expedited services.</p>

      <p>From March 1, fifteen air carriers (see below) will switch to the electronic air waybill (e-AWB) as the preferred process for shipping airfreight. This is a significant milestone in the air cargo industry and creates a new level of urgency for forwarders to move toward the eAWB.  On the carrier side, the benefits of the e-AWB are clear — airlines need the information to populate security filings and to streamline a high volume of airfreight shipments. On the forwarder side, the advantages are less defined. Forwarders must have business value to make the transition.  Some carriers are meeting the challenge of forwarder eAWB adoption by utilising the stick portion of the 'carrot or the stick' motivational practice by charging for paper documentation at the house and master bill level. While this helps push the discussion forward, the overall value to the industry will be reached when additional forwarder objections or barriers to participation are addressed. One of the major objections to forwarder e-AWB participation has been the difficulty to manage and maintain the specific requirements within each trade lane and to determine what shipments are eAWB eligible. In order to mitigate this barrier to entry, many airlines are adopting an innovate method to boost forwarder participation called the Single Process approach. The Single Process approach is a more streamlined method that makes it easier for forwarders to submit digital air waybill information. Simply stated, forwarders provide air waybill details electronically without worrying about destination or transit countries. As a result, forwarders will no longer have to determine whether an airport is e-AWB-enabled or if a shipment qualifies for digital submission. Carriers handle the printing of paper air waybills on demand. It is also important to note that although the Single Process approach can minimise e-AWB complexity for forwarders, it places carriers at the centre of information management. In order to reduce the workload on a carrier's business, airlines may turn to technology providers that can help streamline and simplify many IT challenges. Returning to the forwarder perspective, the Single Process approach is beneficial to the air cargo industry but still does not address all forwarder concerns. In general, there are several factors required for forwarders to derive meaningful value from the e-AWB: • A streamlined 'one-to-many' interface: Solutions should easily translate airway bill information into the specific carrier's format and mask the complexity of message handling. This also eliminates the need for forwarders to use a different portal for each airline. • Capabilities to grow: Systems must be extensible– Forwarders need flexible choices within the same framework or provider. This should also include options to add services as business needs evolve.  • Options for data re-use: Solutions that only address the e-AWB or bookings do not add real value. Forwarders need to further repurpose information to maximise benefits. Now, as  Air Canada, Air France-KLM, American Airlines, British Airways/IBERIA (IAG), Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Etihad Airways, Finnair, Lufthansa Cargo, Qatar Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Swiss and United Airlines are moving to further implement the eAWB, industry-wide involvement in the e-AWB programme is to be encouraged. Forwarders increasingly need to meet the expanding carrier electronic communication requirements, increase visibility and improve performance. This latest e-AWB programme is yet another indication of the drive towards paperless operations to increase efficiency, reduce costs and improve the end customer experience.

      <p>Taking its range of solutions for pharmaceutical cargo a notch higher, Singapore Airlines (SIA) has signed a lease agreement with shipment container provider SkyCell, for leasing of temperature-controlled pharma containers, effective May 1, 2019. This is a step in the right direction for SIA thus expanding its THRUCOOL quality corridor network.</p>
      <p>SIA launched THRUCOOL in September 2018 as a cold chain service to transport high-value, time-sensitive and temperature-controlled pharmaceutical cargo with speed and reliability. The launch coincided with the introduction of a 'quality corridor' along the Zurich-Singapore-Sydney route, with strict end-to-end temperature control for the handling and transportation of temperature-sensitive goods. By complying with standards adopted from the IATA CEIV Pharma1 program, the quality corridor addresses the industry's need for safety, care and efficiency in the transportation of pharmaceutical products.</p>
      <p>The Swiss-made containers are designed to maintain pharmaceutical products between +2 to +8 degrees Celsius or +15 to +25 degrees Celsius, even under extreme ambient temperatures. Cutting-edge patented insulation helps to reflect maximum radiation and minimize heat conduction, while cooling technology that stores five times more energy than traditional methods ensures that each container is kept at a steady temperature. The containers are all equipped with IoT sensors which connect to a data cloud for quality monitoring.</p>
      <p>SIA senior vice president for cargo, Chin Yau Seng, said, "The expansion of our THRUCOOL quality corridor network and lease partnership with SkyCell demonstrate our commitment to providing quality-assured dedicated cold chain services when transporting time- and temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical shipments. We will continue to improve our service offerings and collaborate with our industry partners to pursue innovation in the shipping of pharmaceuticals."</p>
      <p>"Singapore Airlines is the leading airline in Asia Pacific with a specialized pharma offering and an extensive network. The collaboration will meet the growing demand for reliable and safe pharmaceutical transportation solutions in the Asia-Pacific region and contribute to eliminating temperature excursions for shipments to emerging markets," said Richard Ettl, CEO of SkyCell.</p>
      <p>Starting June 13, 2019, SIA's quality corridor network will include Amsterdam and Ho Chi Minh City. Customers now have the option of using THRUCOOL to transport pharmaceutical products from Amsterdam or Zurich to Ho Chi Minh City or Sydney via Singapore, with assurance of maximum attention to product integrity at each step of the journey. Looking ahead, SIA will continue to collaborate with industry partners to expand its quality corridor network across key trade lanes.</p>

      <p>dnata has received the Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) certification from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for its pharma-handling processes at its Dubai World Central (DWC) facility. The UAE-based company's facility at Dubai International (DXB) is already CEIV Pharma-certified.</p>
      <p>According to dnata, it has significantly invested over the past few years in infrastructure and equipment to enhance its pharma capabilities. The cold storage areas in the cargo facilities are modular and enable teams to manage changing handling demands with dedicated climate control capability. Web-based monitoring systems allow for real-time management of all areas. dnata also began using cool dollies to ensure seamless delivery of temperature-sensitive goods from the warehouse to the aircraft.</p>
      <p>"Air cargo has been playing an increasing role in the transportation of temperature-sensitive cargo, including pharmaceutical products," said Bernd Struck, senior vice president of UAE cargo and DWC airline services at dnata. "We constantly enhance our operations to meet the growing demand, and invest in cutting-edge technologies to provide the highest possible value to our customers."</p>
      <p>IATA's CEIV Pharma certification sets a common standard for the handling of pharmaceutical products, with the aim of improving the overall supply chain for these temperature-sensitive shipments. "Improving industry logistics networks to achieve supply chain excellence increasingly requires transparency and cooperation amongst all supply chain partners to provide the high-quality services customers demand to ultimately safeguard patient safety," said Glyn Hughes, global head of cargo at IATA.</p>
      <p>Across the two Dubai airports, dnata handled 3,130 tonnes of pharmaceutical products in the financial year 2018-19. Outside of the UAE, dnata has achieved the CEIV Pharma certification in Amsterdam (AMS), Dallas (DFW), Singapore (SIN) and Toronto (YYZ), as well as the Good Distribution Practice (GDP) certification in Amsterdam (AMS), London (LHR), Manchester (MAN), Singapore (SIN) and Zurich (ZRH).</p>

      <p>Freight forwarder Panalpina has confirmed it has completed the acquisition on Kenyan perishables forwarder Air Connection. The Switzerland-based freight forwarder first announced the deal in May but had been waiting for approval from the Competition Authority of Kenya, which, as reported by Air Cargo News, it received earlier this week. Conditions are attached – Panalpina will need to retain at least 95% of the employees of Air Connection for at least one year after the transaction's completion date. "The acquisition of Air Connection is another important step in building our Perishables Network. It further strengthens our existing global footprint and positions us as a clear market leader in perishables in Kenya," says Stefan Karlen, chief executive of Panalpina. "It will also allow us to develop our perishables presence in the neighbouring countries of Tanzania and Uganda, where we see a lot of potential." The company has been expanding its presence in the perishables market over the last few years, with the sector seen as useful for providing regular and consistent back-haul traffic. The forwarder has also this year launched a perishables network, which "offers customers in both origin and destination countries complete end-to-end solutions on a global scale". "Being part of a major logistics company which is focused on becoming the preferred global supplier of perishables logistics means we can now offer our customers end-to-end solutions and grow the perishables business out of Kenya," added Manjit Brar, owner and managing director of Air Connection. Air Connection has operations close to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi and in Mombasa. The company specializes in the export of flowers and vegetables from Kenya to multiple destinations, including the Netherlands and the UK. The perishables business of Air Connection will be merged with Panalpina Airflo. The combined business boosts Panalpina Airflo's existing cold storage capabilities to a total of 4,200 sq m dedicated to perishables and will handle around 70,000 tons of perishables airfreight per year. When announcing approval for the Air Connection deal, the Competition Authority of Kenya also approved Kuhne+Nagel's purchase of Trillvane. Read more freight forwarder news</p>

      <p>DALLAS – Soon, customers who receive a shipment of fresh-cut roses may be able to tell exactly where the flowers came from, how long the journey took and what condition they are in with just a glance at the air waybill (AWB).</p>
      <p>Today at IATA's World Cargo Symposium, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) revealed plans to launch its own data-sharing platform that will provide supply chains access to the status of associated real-time data regarding flower shipments.</p>
      <p>The platform, which is part of the airport's Smart Cargo Mainport Program, will create a link between an air waybill number and cargo data, such as number of boxes, flower type and number of stems per box, and generates a unique code that partners will use to access information through their internal systems.</p>
      <p>"Through close collaboration between the floriculture and air cargo sectors, we are now able to link two critical sets of data and increase trust between parties by making that data available to everyone, at all times," said Jonas van Stekelenburg, Head of Cargo, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.</p>
      <p>Holland Flower Alliance, a group comprised of logistics and floriculture industry professionals, and logistics companies Kuehne + Nagel and Panalpina, share involvement in the initiative.</p>
      <p>"The development and launch of this data sharing platform is a real example that we are doing 'new stuff' benefiting all stakeholders in the floriculture chain," said Marcel de Nooijer, executive vice president at Air France-KLM.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) – Hong Kong's largest independent cargo handler – is the first cargo terminal operator (CTO) in the world to complete a pilot for IATA's new Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit (SFOC).</p>
      <p>SFOC is part of the Smart Facility program which aims to provide total transparency on capacities and services offered by CTOs, by means of a multi-tiered validation process. This could save thousands of man-hours every year taken up with largely duplicated auditing effort.</p>
      <p>Hactl was chosen as the launch test site for the new audit system because of the scale and complexity of its operations, the diverse range of cargo it handles, the number of carriers (over 100) it serves, and the company's highly-developed quality management systems.</p>
      <p>"The IATA Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit (SFOC) pilot with Hactl was successful. The feedback received from the Hactl team was valuable in fine-tuning the audit questions, auditor actions and guidance ensuring a consistently high audit quality across the program," says IATA global head of cargo Glyn Hughes.</p>
      <p>SFOC targets a reduction in complexity and number of current industry audits, by adopting all IATA standards relating to cargo terminal operations.</p>
      <p>"Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit reports will enable carriers to complement their risk analysis data, and conduct more focused on-site audits that are shorter, less resource-intensive and less frequent," explains Hughes.</p>
      <p>Initially the program aims to reduce carrier audit complexity by 50%, reducing the burden on cargo terminal operators.</p>
      <p>Remote validation</p>
      <p>The Smart Facility program will encompass remote validation of handling facilities' infrastructure and equipment, supplemented by the SFOC on-site audit. The program will provide a central register of all participating handlers' physical resources and capabilities, and will also confirm that all validated handling agents comply with IATA's Cargo Handling Manual (ICHM), a uniform set of standards and criteria covering all aspects of their operations.</p>
      <p>"The IATA Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit will provide assurance to the air cargo industry that the published infrastructure, equipment and operating procedure information is complete and accurate," says Marc Voelkl, IATA's Project Manager – Smart Facility. "Having validated capacity information of Cargo Terminal Operators publicly available will facilitate better matchmaking between carriers and handlers, and assist in network planning and development, catering precisely to the shippers' needs."</p>
      <p>The SFOC Audit shares some content with IATA's ISAGO Cargo and Mail (CGM) discipline; an SFOC- accredited CTO will therefore be automatically validated for the CGM discipline. The SFOC Audit will be offered as a stand-alone audit, or in conjunction with ISAGO (refresher) audits, to further reduce accreditation costs and duration of audits.</p>
      <p>Hactl COO Tan Chee Hong, adds: "The Smart Facility Operational Capacity Audit will provide a simple, public register of all handler's facilities and capabilities, supported by benchmarking against universally accepted industry standards. This can only result in the spread of best practice, and competition based on quality rather than price.</p>
      <p>"We were very happy to support this excellent initiative from IATA, because Hactl is in favour of any measure that promotes the adoption of high and consistent standards throughout the air cargo industry. We must all eradicate any weak links in air cargo supply chains, for the collective good of the industry – and this is a very effective move towards that goal."</p>
      <p>Further SFOC pilot audits are to be conducted at handling locations in London, Luxembourg, Singapore, Amsterdam and Dubai throughout the remainder of 2018. Alongside these pilots, IATA will continue development of the Smart Facility Standards Manual and the Smart Facility Auditor Training programme.</p>

      <p>Brussels Airport, European hub that handles pharmaceuticals in large volume, has invested in new infrastructure and products and also integrated new technologies such as blockchain as part of its services, to ensure safe transport of temperature-sensitive commodity.</p>
      <p>"We are also developing innovative solutions based on new technology such as blockchain, which is used on our digital platform BRUcloud, and allows all stakeholders to track in real time the route of the transported goods," says Arnaud Feist, CEO of Brussels Airport Company.</p>
      <p>As the world's first airport to be awarded the CEIV quality certificate for its cargo division in 2014, Brussels Airport is internationally regarded as the standard for the carriage of temperature-sensitive products, such as medicines and vaccines.</p>
      <p>Belgium is a leading hub in Europe and the world at large for medicine and vaccine exports. In 2017, proprietary medicinal products worth 40.3 billion EUR were exported from our country which accounts for 10.6 percent of total Belgian exports.</p>
      <p>"Nearly half (48.9 percent) of these exports are intended for countries outside the European Union," explains Catherine Rutten, the CEO of pharma.be, the umbrella organisation which represents 130 innovative pharmaceutical companies in Belgium.</p>
      <p>"In part, it is thanks to the investments of the logistical partners, such as Brussels Airport Company, that Belgium is a preferred country for pharma exports to overseas countries. Doing so also sees our country play its part in the pursuit of the global health objectives".</p>
      <p>Over the years, the airport devised various products and services specifically geared to serve the pharmaceutical industry. As such, there is now worldwide interest in the Airside Pharma Transporter, as it ensures a measurable constant temperature on the tarmac for the cargo on board.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the infrastructure developments, the airport said: "Brussels Airport is investing 100 million euros in the construction of ultramodern logistic buildings of 100,000 m² in the cargo area. Half of this infrastructure will be specifically designed to handle high-quality and temperature-sensitive goods, such as pharmaceutical products."</p>
      <p>Under the aegis of the international cross-industry interest group Pharma.aero, of which Brussels Airport is one of the founding members alongside the airports of Miami and Singapore, two so-called pharma corridors were recently put in place on the major trade routes Brussels - Montevideo and Brussels - Hong Kong. All logistic chain players within the corridor comply with imposed quality requirements to ensure an uninterrupted cold chain.</p>
      <p>"The quality parameters for a pharma corridor were established in association with the pharma companies. Brussels Airport is keen to step up the number of pharma corridors even further in times to come to facilitate the global quality carriage of pharmaceutical products from our country," Feist concludes.</p>

      <p>An independent freight forwarder network has announced a strategic partnership to bring cutting edge cargo booking software to its members.</p>
      <p>Globalink Network of Oceanside, California inked a deal with Miami-based SkySpace Cargo to access instant quote functionality, tender management and an electronic payment gateway for air cargo booking transactions.</p>
      <p>Globalink is a private network of vetted agents, with membership limited by region. High demand prompted CEO Bill Siemens to launch a sister organisation, the Global Value Network.</p>
      <p>Siemens credits 16 years of growth to the company's commitment to building strong business relationships and staying abreast of industry trends.</p>
      <p>"At both Globalink and Global Value, we have a long track record of introducing new and innovative tools to our members, usually being the first in our industry," he says.</p>
      <p>One trend that is impossible to ignore is the adoption of technologies to increase speed, transparency, and accuracy of the traditional logistics workflow.</p>
      <p>SkySpace Cargo is the world's first air cargo trading platform, where freight forwarders can quote, book and manage cargo shipments. The platform optimizes routes across the globe from over 50,000 flights and more than 100 airlines. An instant quote tool with pricing updated daily eliminates the need for days-long price negotiation with each carrier. Customs documentation can be uploaded directly to the platform in advance of a shipment, and at origin, cargo photographs and inspection documents are added to the file.</p>
      <p>Globalink and Global Value agents will now be able to view documents and monitor the status of each shipment from their desktop or mobile device, reducing costly customs delays and unexpected damage issues. Transparent pricing, instant quotes and a built-in payment gateway streamline negotiation and billing.</p>
      <p>"All SkySpace customers have access to tools equal to or better than the existing market leaders," said SkySpace CEO Toby Raworth. Siemens agrees, adding, "given the digitization trend sweeping our industry, SkySpace is exactly what our members need to compete with any of the new digital services, and to stay ahead of this trend."</p>

      <p>cargo.one will utilise one.connect for the first time, further simplifying its integration process with airlines.</p>
      <p>one.connect is the result of knowledge and technological requirements from past integrations placed into a single standardised technology layer, enabling connections to a large number of airline legacy systems.</p>
      <p>Welcoming the first Asian partner, Moritz Claussen, managing director of cargo.one says: "NCA's main deck capacities will further add to cargo.one's attractiveness for freight forwarders, allowing us to increase demand on the platform which will, in turn, lead to more capacity distribution overall for those airlines partnering with cargo.one."</p>
      <p>Satoshi Shimura, vice president, general manager and head of business digitalization at NCA says: "It will enhance our customers' experience and help us reach new customer segments. cargo.one has proven to be a reliable, innovative and fast-moving partner to a growing number of airlines and we are happy to take the lead as the first Asian carrier to join the platform."</p>
      <p>Integration work to connect NCA's cargo system iCargo to cargo.one will start later this year with the launch of capacity expected late in the first quarter of 2020.</p>

      <p>SATS and TUM CREATE have teamed up to develop the world's first artificial intelligence powered robotic arm cargo system to digitise handling.</p>
      <p>The system, Speedcargo comprises of three products – Cargo Eye, Cargo Mind and Cargo Arm, which are targeted at optimising cargo acceptance as well as palletisation through intelligent ULD planning and packing.</p>
      <p>The AI-powered operating system enables data connectivity for end-to-end optimisation and improves safety and security across cargo operations.</p>
      <p>SATS and TUM CREATE have achieved 99.99% accuracy rate for accepting cargo during trials of Cargo Eye, which produces a digital fingerprint for incoming cargo in real-time using a 3D camera system for pallet optimisation.</p>
      <p>The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) facilitated the collaboration with its second Aviation Challenge where TUM CREATE was awarded S$1.9 million for Speedcargo's prototype development.</p>
      <p>The project received S$4 million in funding from the National Research Foundation Singapore's Central Gap Fund.</p>
      <p>Alex Hungate, president and chief executive officer of SATS says: "Piloting this technology in Singapore is part of our wider innovation programme to enhance services and scale our operational efficiency. These capabilities would enhance our cargo network across Asia Pacific, along with COSYS+, our cloud-based cargo terminal management system, to augment real-time cargo visibility along our digital corridors."</p>
      <p>Dr Suraj Nair, head of Speedcargo Technology says: "This partnership with SATS is a unique opportunity for us to develop our technology into a fit-for-purpose solution for the airfreight industry. Support from industry players and regulators like CAAS is essential in realising Speedcargo's vision of the automated airfreight terminal of the future."</p>

    <content>
      <p>Unit Load Device (ULD) management services provider Jettainer has acquired the online platform skypooling, a tool that helps participating airlines in managing their containers more efficiently.</p>
      <p>The company informs that it has already started working on the expansion and further development of skypooling.</p>
      <p>On the platform, the exchange of ULDs between controllers of different airlines will be facilitated globally. Users of the platform provide information about ULD understocks or overstocks. This allows airlines to help each other balance container inventories to ensure benefits and savings for all participants. By transporting less empty cargo, airlines benefit from additional freight revenue, fuel savings and lower CO2 emissions, which in turn are good for the environment.</p>
      <p>In order to ensure the further development of the platform and to tackle technical challenges, skypooling founder Willem-Jan Loomans was looking for a suitable partner.</p>
      <p>Jettainer has been an active user of the platform for many years and quickly recognised the potential. The current basic functionalities of the simple ULD exchange are to remain free of charge. The network currently has around 100 members. Almost all of the existing airline members have migrated to the new owner.</p>
      <p>"skypooling thus becomes a one-stop shop, the online marketplace for searching and offering containers and pallets. The complete coordination of ULD rental will take place via the platform: From automated processes, direct booking confirmation and communication to all parties involved to recording the issue and return of ULDs," says Christine Klemmer, general manager of skypooling.</p>
      <p>The new version includes a modernized frontend for the customer, with technical improvements to make it easier to find the required devices. It is scheduled to go online in the fall of 2019. In addition, Jettainer is already planning new features for the future. For example, a lost &amp; found function and insurance services are to be integrated.</p>
      <p>"We are making supply and demand in the ULD environment transparent and will bring together parties who would otherwise not have found each other so easily. This enables us to offer solutions that would not have been possible before. I am delighted to be able to further develop this excellent basis with my team and make it the most important ULD portal for current and future user groups," adds Klemmer.</p>

    <title>More carriers introduce online air cargo booking as modernisation creeps in</title>

      <p>Calls for the air cargo industry to emulate its passenger cousins with online bookings appear to be working. IAG Cargo today announced it would roll out an e-booking system allowing customers to complete a shipment order in less than three minutes.</p>
      <p>The carrier launched the platform in Spain, where it now accounts for 15% of bookings for Iberia, acknowledged by the group as its leader of IT.</p>
      <p>Forwarders and shippers can book both general cargo and premium products on the system, make multiple bookings and manage all bookings – even those made by phone – online. The company says that it will add more features throughout the year.</p>
      <p>"The air cargo industry is going through a period of rapid digitisation, driven by the need to make operations more efficient and customer friendly," said Angel Cabeza Rivas, head of IT at IAG Cargo. "The service will not only make us more effective as a business, but will make it easier than ever for customers to do business with us."</p>
      <p>The move follows that from Etihad, which last week announced that WCA members and Etihad Cargo loyalty members which use the WIN e-platform for bookings and e-AWBs, will enjoy a reduced rate.</p>
      <p>Both IAG Cargo and Etihad have courted smaller, independent forwarders in the past year or two, and the moves seem designed to facilitate transactions with SMEs. Etihad's platform will offer instant pricing as well as e-AWBs and track and trace.</p>
      <p>"Part of our continuing growth story will be underscored by our ability to meet the needs of our customers, in a rapidly evolving cargo market, whether they are a large multinational company or an SME user that needs to send goods and services around the world to grow their business," said David Kerr, vice-president of Etihad Cargo.</p>
      <p>In another emulation of the passenger business, the carrier's loyalty programme, CargoConnect, is targeted at the SME sector. Users can earn Guest Miles, which can be redeemed against flight upgrades or products from its Rewards shop.</p>
      <p>In past years, multiple quotation and booking platforms for both carriers and forwarders have sprung up, from last year's portal launch by Swiss WorldCargo, to Kuehne + Nagel's FreightNet and independent quoting platforms for shippers, such as Freightos.</p>
      <p>Another innovation comes from CHAMP, the IT company whose sticky tentacles seem to stretch widely through the industry. Its online booking platform is now available for forwarders to book via CargoUpdate, its messaging and notice board. Currently restricted to four carriers, it hopes to roll out bookings for more of its carriers in the future.</p>
      <p>Finally, the days of the phone call booking look like they will soon be history.</p>

      <p>This week, the Cool Chain Association (CCA) hosted its bi-annual event in Luxembourg to discuss industry trends – this time, narrowing in on the waste and spoilage associated with the supply chain of edible perishables.</p>
      <p>Shrinkage in supply chain logistics is a tale as old as time, but the CCA is now calling for a change in attitude within the industry, pointing to the startling statistic that an estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food – a third of all produced – is wasted along the supply chain each year.</p>
      <p>The organization's chairman, Stavros Evangelakakis, who is also global product manager of healthcare and perishables at Luxembourgish all-cargo carrier Cargolux, said that the air cargo community should lead the way in setting its own industry standard. "We should aim for quality, not wait for other agencies to come up with standards," he said. "We should look internally and act now."</p>
      <p>The overarching theme of the event was efficiency, which has become more measurable thanks to modern data collection methods and the digitalization of operations management. Still, achieving efficiency is easier said than done. The fragmented nature of the supply chain creates communication hurdles between partners, making planning more difficult.</p>
      <p>The CCA commissioned Philippe Schuler, a food waste prevention consultant and keynote speaker of the event, to conduct a "farm to fork" study of the transportation of papayas from Brazil to Europe to observe the waste phenomenon. Schuler's research, "Papayas – studying waste in perishable logistics," is available to CAA members.</p>
      <p>"The information needs to be made accessible," Schuler said. "When we all start to have access to the data, we can start to solve the problems."</p>

      <p>Brussels Airport's cloud based data sharing platform, BRUcloud has had a successful first two months with eight more companies using the application in their live operations.</p>
      <p>The slot booking app eliminates the problem of waiting and idle times at ground handling facilities by coordinating the match between supply and demand of time slots, streamlining the pick up and delivery of freight at the ground handler and providing better capacity utilisation and elimination of peaks and idle times.</p>
      <p>The tool makes it possible for the booker, such as a forwarder to request a single or recurrent time slot at a specific facility via a central web application for all ground handlers.</p>
      <p>The supplier can make time slots for different cargo types available via the web interface or system-to-system link with its intern slot management system.</p>
      <p>The app went live on 15 January with seven companies, and by 27 March another eight companies started using the app.</p>
      <p>WFS general manager for Belgium, Eddy Myngheer says: "WFS supports this project for 100%. We strongly believe in the positive effects of the use of the Slot Booking App. The first GO LIVE was a success! The involved participants within WFS are more than ever enthusiastic about the further roll out."</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding airfreight director, David Bellon says the app has helped improve planning of resources and reduced waiting times, saying: "DHL Global Forwarding is convinced this is a milestone providing transparency and an improved handling process at cargo pick-up and delivery. This is only a first step towards a further digitisation of our industry, more in particular at Brussels Airport."</p>
      <p>After the launch new partners showed an interest in the app; BRUcargo cargo development manager, Sara Van Gelder says: "Over the past months we have had meetings with all interested parties to demonstrate the application and inform them on how to become part of the user group.</p>
      <p>This has resulted in 8 additional companies using the application as of this moment, while more parties are lined up to do the same in the weeks and months to come."</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport head of cargo &amp; logistics, Steven Polmans says the application is part of the landside management tool being developed at Brussels, saying: "We will not only continue to improve and develop this app based on feedback of our users, later this year additional application will be launched that will interact and share data with the slot booking app."</p>
      <p>The companies that joined in January were Aviapartner, WFS, DHL Global Forwarding, Nippon Express, Kuehne + Nagel, Panalpina and IFA Skyfast, and the eight new participants are Saco Group Air, MSE, Bollore, WFS Forwarding, DB Schenker, CEVA Logistics, Yusen Logistics and DSV.</p>

      <p>Shanghai Pharma, one of China's largest listed pharmaceuticals groups, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DHL Supply Chain to expand its global logistics infrastructure. Under the MOU, the pharmaceuticals giant – which generated revenues of more than  US$18 billion (RMB121 billion) last year – will partner with DHL Supply Chain to enhance quality control measures, streamline distribution processes, and strengthen local and international regulatory compliance. The MOU will grant Shanghai Pharma priority access to DHL's global logistics network including temperature-sensitive life sciences services to Europe. DHL Supply Chain will also support Shanghai Pharma's supply chain optimization needs as the manufacturer ramps up its overseas distribution and retailing efforts. The Chinese government has recently been putting pressure on China's pharmaceutical sector to improve the transparency and efficiency of local supply chains. Shanghai Pharma president and executive director, Cho Man, said: "The quality and resilience of our logistics infrastructure will determine not only how successfully we adapt to new legislation– which seeks to cut down on multiple distributors and mark-ups by only allowing two invoices per goods shipment – but also our ability to capitalize on the huge international growth opportunity for high-grade Chinese pharmaceutical products and medical devices.". "China's national market for drugs has grown rapidly in recent years to become the world's second-largest with an estimated growth to around US$167 billion by 2020[2]. Our partnership with DHL will help Shanghai Pharma to become one of the world's foremost pharmaceutical manufacturers – supported by a global distribution network that combines world-class quality control with fast, seamless delivery." DHL Supply Chain chief executive for Greater China, Yin Zou, added: "China's pharmaceutical industry has historically suffered from high levels of fragmentation amongst its local customers and distributors, an issue which recent legislative changes…have sought to combat. In this regulatory climate, end-to-end supply chain management plays an increasingly crucial role in determining how effectively Chinese pharmaceuticals firms not only maintain sales locally, but gain traction abroad in a cost-effective and sustainable manner."</p>

      <p>Ground-handling giant Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) and Swiss WorldCargo, the airfreight division of Swiss International Air Lines, opened the first Good Distribution Practice-certified pharmaceutical facility at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).</p>
      <p>The GDP certification, awarded for JFK's Building 66, assure that the facility conforms with quality standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Parenteral Drug Association (PDA) for handling pharmaceutical and life–science products.</p>
      <p>Earning the certification came "in response to growing customer demand for high–quality, standardized pharma handling," said Michael Simpson, executive vice president of WFS' Americas division. "We will continue to expand our network of certified facilities, adding to our current list of JFK and Miami in the Americas as well as multiple locations in Europe."</p>
      <p>The GDP cert includes the establishment of a "Pharmaceutical Handling Quality Manual" and a quality management system at Building 66, along with dedicated cooler facilities, and the training in special products handling for a team of personnel. WFS also invested in a new cooler for the 1,000–square-foot pharma facility.</p>
      <p>WFS has also signed a 15-year lease on a new, 346,000–square–foot cargo terminal at JFK, which will have a throughput capacity of over 300,000 tonnes per year, when it opens in 2020/21. The temperature-controlled facility "will offer improved cargo flows and reduced transfer times, shorter truck waiting times and incorporate the latest security and screening systems and procedures," WFS said.</p>
      <p>Michael Ganz, head of the Northeast/Midwest USA and Canada divisions for Swiss WorldCargo, said the GDP designation at JFK "allows us to offer additional quality corridors to our pharma and healthcare customers."</p>
      <p>In 2018, Swiss WorldCargo received a global CEIV-Pharma certification via IATA, which ensures that the company adheres to the highest standards of pharmaceutical handling. The airline operates three daily flights from Zurich (ZRH) and Geneva (GVA) to JFK.</p>

      <p>Panalpina's recent acquisition spree picked up pace this week with a second trophy added on Sept. 28, this time in Germany, where the Switzerland-based logistics company agreed to buy Germany-based Cool Chain Group (CCG), from its parent company, Rungis Express.</p>
      <p>With CCG added to the roster, Panalpina will gain an experienced team of employees and a growing German perishables business, with more than 100 corporate customers, representing around 14,000 tons of airfreight per year. CCG operates fully controlled cool chain logistics services at different temperature zones, ranging from -25° to +25°C.</p>
      <p>The move represents a significant expansion of Panalpina's perishables network in Germany and, by default, bolsters its broader European and global capabilities. "Our recent acquisitions in the perishables market have concentrated on the export side, but we also want to increase our footprint in key import markets and build our end-to-end perishables capabilities at major gateways such as Frankfurt and, as demonstrated yesterday, Amsterdam," said Stefan Karlen, CEO of Panalpina. "These latest developments are further important steps towards offering complete end-to-end solutions on a global scale as we continue to expand our Perishables Network."</p>
      <p>CCG spent years establishing expertise in international airfreight and the import of perishables, such as fresh cut flowers, beans, fish, frozen sea food and fresh mangoes, mostly from Africa and Latin America. However, former parent company Rungis Express chose to divest of its subsidiary, in order to focus on "overland distribution and the wholesale of gourmet products."</p>
      <p>For Panalpina, the acquisition fits into a growing cold-chain portfolio, where margins are higher than they are with general freight.</p>

      <p>Swissport has introduced self-service check-in kiosks for airfreight at its cargo warehouses at Brussels Airport and Amsterdam Airport, in order to expedite freight handling processes.</p>
      <p>The newly developed system, which will be rolled out across Swissport's core cargo stations over the next 24 months, will reduce truck waiting times and increase the quality of airfreight documentation, the handler said.</p>
      <p>Drivers present their identification at the kiosk, scan relevant documentation and then receive a text message indicating which truck gate they should use to drop off their cargo.</p>
      <p>Forwarders can enter shipping information into the system via a web portal, and customers can link their IT systems with Swissport's database via an API interface.</p>
      <p>The kiosk system is also connected to the EU's regulated agent database, which verifies the security status of each shipment during the document check.</p>
      <p>"Our new kiosks support the paperless eFreight initiative by IATA and at the same time accelerate the import and export processes for our customers significantly," said Hendrik Leyssens, vice president global operations cargo at Swissport International.</p>
      <p>"Truck drivers benefit from minimal wait times and faster turnarounds," he added.</p>
      <p>Also at Brussels Airport, work is currently under way on Swissport's new air cargo facility. It will consist of a 25,000 sq m warehouse, a material handling system, office space and 3,620 sq m of end-to-end facilities, and will feature extra space for pharmaceutical products. Construction began in January 2019 and will take about two years to complete.</p>

      <p>AMERICAN Airlines (AA) Cargo has started construction of a 25,000-sq ft pharmaceuticals hub in Philadelphia, writes Thelma Etim, deputy editor. It is designed to cater for a full range of temperature-sensitive products being shipped in and out of the strategically important north-east 'pharma corridor' and includes a 6,000-sq ft area for Controlled Room Temperature (CRT) passive shipments managed at +15°C and +25°C, along with sections for maintaining  +2°C to +8°C and -10°C to -20°C consignments. The opening of the hub – scheduled to be completed in September – will coincide with the roll-out of a full ExpediteTCsm cold chain programme across the newly merged American network, a statement reveals. "This new pharmaceuticals centre will enable American's provision of state-of-the-art, dedicated services for our life-science and healthcare customers. Coupled with our proven handling processes, this facility will complement our existing temperature-sensitive infrastructure enhancements throughout our network", reveals Jim Butler, president of AA Cargo.</p>

      <p>Delta Cargo has launched a totally re-designed website, deltacargo.com, providing customers with a one-stop shop for all their cargo needs, making the shipping process easier than ever before.</p>
      <p>Customers can now book, check-in, manage and track their shipments entirely online, via a computer or mobile device, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Plus customers can submit electronic air waybills for free on the website, which eliminates air waybill preparation fees and significantly improves the speed of the customer experience.</p>
      <p>Delta's vice president for cargo, Shawn Cole says: "This new website provides complete end-to-end digital booking, acceptance and tracking, 24/7, on laptops and mobile devices anywhere in the globe.</p>
      <p>"The improved functionality comes as a direct result of customer feedback and is a real game changer for Delta Cargo."</p>
      <p>Key features include the following:</p>
      <p>A new interface design that allows customers to book, manage, track, or check-in a shipment from any page, plus access to the latest cargo news. There are also guided booking paths for a step-by-step approach or an advanced booking path tailored to experienced users, plus booking flexibility with convenient multiple flight and product offerings.</p>
      <p>Full functionality for guests without a Delta Cargo account number or a deltacargo.com registration. Guest features include flight and product availability, price quotes, real time tracking, as well as full booking edit capabilities.</p>
      <p>Registered customers can customize the website to include homepage booking preferences, email notifications, and frequently used booking templates, as well as store payment information, reducing acceptance processing time. The website also features expedited known shipper review with industry-first integration with TSA's Known Shipper system.</p>
      <p>Customisable, allowing customers to save booking preferences, select notifications, and save frequently booked shipments as templates.</p>
      <p>Improved tracking and shipment management with in-flight tracking capability showing progress from departure to arrival. GPS tracking can be added to any shipment during the booking process and viewed in real-time, and historical GPS data can also be viewed throughout shipment lifecycle. The air waybill will be displayed to show customs status on the tracking page.</p>
      <p>At check-in, domestic and international air waybill details can be submitted free of charge, regardless of shipment booking channel.</p>

      <p>Today, dnata furthered its investment in freight forwarding by purchasing stake in two companies – a 50 percent stake in Dubai Express, Freightworks LLC and a 25.5 percent stake in France-based Bolloré Logistics LLC, United Arab Emirates (UAE) from UAE-based Kanoo Group LLC. As a result of the transaction, dnata is now the sole owner of Dubai Express, Freightworks LLC and holds a majority stake at 51 percent in Bolloré Logistics LLC, UAE.</p>
      <p>Both parties have agreed to not disclose details of the transaction and that current leadership teams at Dubai Express and Bolloré Logistics, UAE will continue to manage business and operations for the companies.</p>
      <p>Dnata has been a major player in ground handling globally, and as part of the Emirates Group and sister company to Emirates Airlines, is responsible for providing ground handling to the airline community at Dubai. While the company has recently expanded its ground handling presence abroad through increased investments and partnerships, the company is still mindful to bolster its stronghold in the UAE and Middle East.</p>
      <p>Dubai Express is an international freight forwarding company that supports its operations in Dubai through dedicated facilities at Al Ramoul, Dubai Airport Cargo Village, Dubai Airport Free Zone (DAFZA), the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) near Dubai International Airport (DXB) and the new Dubai World Center Airport (DWC), while Bolloré Logistics, UAE operates its Middle East hub out of Dubai, as well as three locations inside DAFZA and JAFZA that are connected to both of the airports. By acquiring ownership and stake in these companies, dnata is continuing the expansion of its service offerings in the Dubai beyond ground handling into freight forwarding.</p>
      <p>Since 2012, dnata has been developing its online booking site Calogi that connects freight forwarders, airlines and third-party logistics suppliers, along with itself as a ground handler, to create a streamlined logistics supply chain to customers. Airlines do not need to pay to join the system, but freight forwarders do. Calogi facilitates the secure and paperless transaction of cargo with tracking that customers can use to check the status of their shipment online in real-time at any time.</p>
      <p>After receiving feedback from stakeholders using the system over the past few years, dnata is now working to further develop the system's capabilities and usability by creating a more intuitive interface that is accessible via mobile devices. The move to further develop the Calogi system is important to dnata because as dnata divisional senior vice president Steve Allen told Air Cargo Airports, "there are a lot of new start up players in this space, and we are keen to ensure our place ahead of them."</p>
      <p>The Calogi system currently supports cargo shipments in Dubai, but the company is considering rolling out the system at other locations in the next three to four years.</p>
      <p>Clearly, dnata proves with its projects and plans that it has grown to be more than a traditional ground handler and will continue to grow as a dominant player in global air cargo logistics across the supply chain that will be worth watching.</p>

      <p>Panalpina has signed a contract with BT to streamline its IT systems, replacing a string of existing local and regional services with a single provider. BT will overhaul the global forwarder's network infrastructure, which connects 500 offices in over 75 countries and move it to a single integrated platform. BT will also provide services from its BT One Voice portfolio to converge voice and data on a single platform. The new network is described as a hybrid infrastructure, based on BT's IP Connect and Internet Connect services, combining the reliability and security of IP-based Virtual Private Networks (VPN) with the flexibility of Internet connections. It will also underpin continued implementation of Panalpina's new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) and transportation management systems. Services such as BT Connect Intelligence, will also optimise the network for the specific applications used on it. Panalpina's chief information officer, Ralf Morawietz described the agreement as "a major milestone on our way to becoming the most customer focused global provider of freight forwarding and logistics solutions." BT would provide a single point of contact for communication services, and "take away the burden of managing a multitude of different suppliers." It would also make it easier to implement new services and to support employees and customers, he added. BT Global Services' president Europe and global telecom markets, Corrado Sciolla, added: "In the new digital world, customers and employees are becoming more demanding, systems are evolving and established rules changing. We are very proud that a global leader such as Panalpina has chosen BT to manage their communication services. The intelligent features of our network services will also help Panalpina improve the performance of its business-critical applications and constantly adapt the whole communications infrastructure to its rapidly evolving digital needs."</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo is further ramping up its foothold in the tech sphere by increasing its cooperation with Berlin-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, cargo.one. This week, it acquired a minority shareholding in the one-year-old cargo-booking startup.</p>
      <p>The platform allows carriers to digitally host and market airfreight capacity to forwarders. To date, some of cargo.one's customers include industry giants Agility, Hellmann and Dachser.</p>
      <p>Peter Gerber, CEO of the Lufthansa Group said that the investment is another step toward the company's goal to lead digitalization in the air freight industry. "We are impressed with the technology and user-friendly product," he said. "Our customers' overall experience is now strongly improved by being able to more efficiently book air cargo capacity."</p>
      <p>Lufthansa began its relationship with cargo.one in July of this year, following its announcement in March to charge an extra €12 processing fee per transaction for customers that choose not to opt for its electronic air waybills. Such moves are part of the carrier's "strategic commitment to elevating the air cargo industry to a higher level of digital maturity," said Boris Hueske, the head of digital transformation at Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>The German carrier has fostered relationships with other tech startups over the year, including an investment in Fleet Logistics, a Portland, Ore.-based digital marketplace that serves to match carriers with customers, and a cooperation with a California-based accelerator, Plug and Play, which has a focus on supply chain-oriented startups.</p>
      <p>"The close cooperation between Lufthansa Cargo and technology startups melds comprehensive air cargo experience with a technology-driven, fresh view of global logistics processes", Hueske said, although the details of Lufthansa's partnerships with the two above-named organizations has not been made explicit.</p>
      <p>Those interested in learning more about the digitalization of the air freight industry are invited to join us Cargo Facts EMEA, to be held 4-6 February at The Westin Grand Frankfurt.

      <p>To share their experience with building an innovative air cargo strategy that enables sustainable growth in today's digital world, Air Cargo Belgium and Nallian, powered by TIACA, are organising a unique collaborative Masterclass for airport executives. The objective is to empower airports to take their air cargo strategy to the next level, leveraging testimonials from pioneering airports such as Brussels Airport, Heathrow, Vienna Airport and Liege Airport and stakeholders such as WFS and DHL Global Forwarding.</p>
      <p>Interactive workshop</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport head of cargo Steven Polmans, explains: "We are getting more and more questions from airports around the world who wish to learn from what we have done in terms of innovation, community building and our digital journey with BRUcloud. This Masterclass is organised for those airports who are looking to build an innovative air cargo strategy, but still hesitating on where to get started or how to accelerate. We want this to be an interactive workshop in which we can share experience, discuss and learn from each other." From strategic to practical, the workshop will explore all aspects of such an air cargo strategy innovation track. Next to Polmans senior air cargo executives from, amongst others, Heathrow, Vienna Airport and Liege Airport will share their vision and lessons learned. Also ground handler WFS and freight forwarder DHL will share their experience with being part of the air cargo community. Data sharing specialist Nallian will shed light on how cloud-based data sharing is facilitating this collaboration. The Masterclass will take place from Wednesday 30 to Thursday 31 January at BRUcargo's Air Cargo Academy in Brussels. On Friday, an additional half day is planned to dive extra deep into BRUcloud, with live demos of the applications. The Masterclass is targeted to senior airport executives.</p>

      <p>Delta Cargo today earned IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) certification for pharmaceutical handling, making it the first global carrier based in the United States to receive the distinction.</p>
      <p>Gareth Joyce</p>
      <p>In conjunction with its CEIV-Pharma-certified partner Air France-KLM-Martinair Cargo, Delta Cargo now operates the first CEIV-Pharma trans-Atlantic network, connecting Delta's Atlanta hub with other CEIV-certified partners, stations and handlers in Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan, Paris and Rome.</p>
      <p>Trans-Atlantic pharmaceutical trade has registered consistent growth over the last decade-plus, however, with 50 percent of the industry's recorded temperature excursions happening while in the hands of air carriers and airports, the airfreight mode saw its share of global pharma transport decline from 17 percent to 11 percent between 2000 and 2013, prompting a demand for industry standards. Efforts to standardize pharma handling by validators, such as CEIV and GDP, have won over many pharma shippers that previously regarded airfreight as unreliable.</p>
      <p>"Delta has made significant investments in the ensuring that our facilities, equipment, operations and staff comply with all applicable standards, regulations and guidelines expected from pharmaceutical manufacturers," said Gareth Joyce, president of the cargo division and senior vice president of airport customer service.</p>
      <p>"Having Delta Cargo, one of the region's largest operators, achieve CEIV-Pharma certification is a boost not only for the airline's customers, who can be confident that their life-saving and temperature-sensitive products will be delivered in impeccable condition, but also the region," said Nick Careen, IATA's vice president of airport, passenger, cargo and security.</p>

      <p>KLM Cargo has launched a pilot project to optimise the supply chain with improvements introduced over period of a weeks at a time in a bid to create the ideal design by April 2017 – which will then be applied at other European stations.</p>
      <p>The carrier is participating in a consortium representing all the parties involved in the supply chain. Partners include Schiphol Cargo, Jan de Rijk Logistics, Cargonaut, Swissport, Kuehne+Nagel and the Customs Services and Tax Authorities.</p>
      <p>Yesterday morning, the first newly scheduled cargo trucks arrived carrying goods from Frankfurt. A distinction is now being drawn between shipments with shorter connecting times and those with less time pressure.</p>
      <p>KLM Cargo says introducing the new schedule is also the first step towards setting up a Cloud platform facilitating data exchange amongst the co-operating parties. This means once data has been delivered 'real time' by other parties in the supply chain, it can be reused, supplemented or modified where necessary.</p>
      <p>From the start, the information is also automatically verified against the applicable customs regulations and safety standards. Not only will this support the exchange of administrative data, it will also facilitate the exchange of status information relating to the shipments.</p>
      <p>KLM Cargo executive vice president, Marcel de Nooijer says: "This is an important adjustment for KLM Cargo, making it possible to further optimise the transhipment process at Schiphol. But, more importantly, this will enable KLM Cargo to enhance the quality of the customer services it provides.</p>
      <p>"By shortening the throughput times for shipments from Europe and making the entire supply chain simpler and more transparent, KLM Cargo can offer its customers far greater predictability regarding delivery."</p>
      <p>Schiphol Cargo head, Jonas van Stekelenburg explains the project involves using each other's data: "Cooperation of this nature is tricky for all the respective parties. You have to look beyond your own needs and work hard to get the job done for one another. It's excellent that KLM and its partners are able to find common ground here.</p>
      <p>"The supply chain optimisation project generates both savings and additional business. After all, because KLM's findings will be open to everyone, the project will promote the cargo business Schiphol-wide.</p>
      <p>The project is supported by the national Neutral Logistic Information Platform (NLIP) steering committee and forms part of government's policy on leading sectors. In the  logistics sector, the Netherlands government aims to raise efficiency and enhance the quality of logistics to ensure the Netherlands maintains its international standing as a leader in this sector in 2020 and beyond.</p>

      <p>In a recent development, AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) has newly launched a 24/7/365 control tower (CT) operation to monitor consignments comprising special cargoes, proactively respond to service disruptions and meet customers' delivery deadlines.</p>
      <p>Managed by a team of fully-trained supply chain specialists and based in Moscow, the control tower offers real-time, round-the-clock monitoring of all cargo movements throughout the entire transportation process across the airline's international network-from booking to final customer delivery.</p>
      <p>The team is responsible to identify and resolve any potential disruption to planned shipment deliveries that can result from a diverse range of circumstances. It includes schedule disruption, documentation issues and the influence of bad weather conditions.</p>
      <p>With its key focus on special cargoes, AirBridgeCargo's control tower team has been created to ensure the airline meets its quality and service priorities for time-and temperature-sensitive products, live animals, off-size&amp;heavy cargoes, e-commerce shipments and other commodities requiring extra attention and the alignment of all operational procedures.</p>
      <p>The ABC control tower is reachable through telephone, skype or e-mail, and serves as a prime contact for niche product deliveries. One of the team's first troubleshooting operations was to find alternative capacity to maintain the delivery timescale of a special cargo shipment from Asia to Europe after bad weather conditions disrupted expected flight departures from the region.</p>
      <p>"Our new control tower is a 'point-of-convergence' which will accumulate all of our cargo movement data to consistently meet our service commitments, and allow us to take preventative or corrective actions as appropriate in case of any potential disruption. We have a highly experienced team of professionals managing the control tower who have the capabilities and skills to manage any challenges that can arise," said Sergey Lazarev, general director of AirBridgeCargo airlines.</p>
      <p>"It will be the foundation of our next step forwards in the arena of special cargoes, and is designed to provide benefits to final consumers, be it medicines or vaccines for their health and well-being, aircraft engines to resolve AOG situations and ensure passengers reach their destinations in good time, or the on-time delivery of cross-border ecommerce purchases for special occasions. ABC is committed to ensuring we can cater to the needs of our customers worldwide," said Lazarev.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the transportation of special cargo commodities has been at the forefront of ABC's operations and growth throughout 2017, with special cargo volumes witnessing a 12 percent growth year-on-year.</p>

    <content>
      <p>United Airlines and Lufthansa Cargo are to cooperate "extensively" on routes between the US and Europe in a metal-neutral joint-venture.</p>
      <p>While the agreement has been in the making for some time – several years, in fact  –  the carriers have now signed a deal they claim will bring a "wide range of benefits to customers", including time savings and flexibility.</p>
      <p>The airlines will have a combined network, allowing customers to book through either carrier's channels, and have coordinated handling and transfer processes at "numerous" stations. The pair will offer more than 600 direct connections each week between the US and Europe.</p>
      <p>The next step will be to begin the joint phases, in which the airlines will align cargo IT systems and processes.</p>
      <p>"The partnership means that we will treat each other's joint-venture capacity equally and sell each other's 'in-scope' network as if it were our own," explained a Lufthansa spokeswoman.</p>
      <p>"The project teams will formalise the steps needed for implementation, including testing of the carrier-specific technology solutions, development and delivery of training for all employees and development of marketing and communications material to promote the initiative. All of these milestones are targeted for delivery later this year."</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo decided a few years ago that deep partnerships would be the key to success. It has a similar relationship with ANA Cargo on routes between Japan and Europe and is also working on a link with Cathay Pacific Cargo.</p>
      <p>"The Lufthansa-United cargo joint-venture will generate numerous benefits for our customers, because our continental and transatlantic networks, our hubs and our fleet complement each other effectively," said Peter Gerber, Lufthansa Cargo CEO.</p>
      <p>Jan Krems, president of United Cargo, added: "We are excited about the benefits that will be generated by our teams' cooperation and our combined capacities. Cargo customers will appreciate the opportunities for quicker and easier shipping between key locations in the US. and Europe."</p>

      <p>German based airline Lufthansa that has recently ordered two new B777 freighters takes another major move for the cargo division.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has entered into cooperation contract with cargo.one, the provider of an airline-independent digital platform for marketing and booking of air freight capacities.</p>
      <p>This enables forwarders digital booking of global air freight capacity in the spot market at live spot rates with immediate confirmation through the platform cargo.one.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo is thus opening up a new digital sales channel for the spot segment. The globally available capacities of Lufthansa Cargo will be integrated into the cargo.one offering for this purpose.</p>
      <p>The partnership between cargo.one and Lufthansa Cargo enables air freight forwarders to book available air freight capacities for td.Flash and td.Pro completely digitally and in real time across the entire available route grid of Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>The platform available at www.cargo.one offers customers an up-to-date online offering. All important information about the connections as well as the real capacity-dependent and dynamic live spot rates are clearly displayed. For each connection, numerous alternatives are displayed at a glance so that the optimal offer can be found quickly.</p>
      <p>"Digitisation allows information to be distributed around the globe in fractions of a second. This has given rise to new expectations with which both carriers and freight forwarders are confronted. We are therefore now offering our customers the opportunity to exchange prices and capacities even faster and to book services even easier," says Peter Gerber, chairman of the board of Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>"Booking platforms such as cargo.one will in future support forwarders in meeting their customers' needs even better. This is the next logical step in the digitisation of our industry."</p>
      <p>"We are pleased to partner with Lufthansa Cargo as the leading air cargo airline in our mission to make air cargo bookable digitally and in real time. Many solutions on the market promise digital bookability. The reality is that in most cases the rates offered do not give access to capacity. In particular at times of high demand, our solution offers air freight forwarders a quick and easy access to capacities with immediate confirmation at live spot rates", said Oliver T Neumann, founder of cargo.one.</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo has opened a new cargo control centre (CCC) at its head office in Abu Dhabi. The new CCC marks a year since the airline began its digitisation initiative.</p>
      <p>The new CCC will serve as a hub for real-time monitoring, tracking and management of all shipments, flights, and UAE road feeder services.</p>
      <p>In addition, it will allow Etihad's cargo flows, departures and arrivals across the network, to be monitored 24 hours a day, with a particular focus on cargo that is time-sensitive.</p>
      <p>Technology in the CCC builds upon SPRINT, Etihad Cargo's booking and reservation system, by introducing key tracking functionalities which include shipment planning and performance monitoring across its five freighter aircraft, as well as bellyhold shipments on more than 250 daily passenger flights.</p>
      <p>In a second phase, Etihad Cargo will increase the CCC's functionality by allowing its quick ramp transfer shipments at Abu Dhabi International Airport to be monitored, as well as allowing advanced cargo information monitoring.</p>
      <p>Rory Fidler, Etihad Cargo's head of technology and innovation, commented: "By implementing data-driven technology and harnessing the ever-changing digital landscape, we have created a customer-friendly software that provides our team with market leading tools to better serve our customers when they need it most."</p>
      <p>"This is yet another step in the continuous evolution of Etihad Cargo to become a digitized air cargo carrier of choices."</p>
      <p>Andre Blech, head of operations and delivery at Etihad Cargo, added: "As our latest digitalisation initiative, the CCC, shifts our modus operandi from a historically reactive model, to a truly proactive service delivery machine that strives to maintain the service delivery promise and support customers' needs every step of their shipment journey."</p>

      <p>The first companies have passed IATA's CEIV Fresh certification programme for the handling of perishable cargo.</p>
      <p>At the IATA World Cargo Symposium, IATA revealed that Cathay Pacific Services Limited (CPSL) and Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) are the first organisations to obtain CEIV Fresh certification.</p>
      <p>The airline, Cathay Pacific, is also expected to achieve certification in May this year, while Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) has been recognised as a partner airport.</p>
      <p>The CEIV Fresh programme is primarily based on the IATA Perishable Cargo Regulations (PCR) which combines professional regulatory and operational input from industry and government experts. </p>
      <p>"Perishable goods is a growing market for air cargo. Ensuring that these delicate and short shelf-life products reach the customer unspoiled with minimal waste and loss is essential. Shippers will have assurance that CEIV Fresh certified companies are operating to the highest quality and standards in the transport of perishable products," said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's director general and chief executive.</p>
      <p>IATA head of cargo Glynn Hughes added that around 25% of perishables are written off as they are transported along the supply chain.</p>
      <p>Hughes said: "We took a community approach to developing CEIV Fresh recognising that the successful shipment requires the alignment of many stakeholders.</p>
      <p>"Shippers can have peace of mind knowing that every entity handling their goods is operating to the same standards. Understanding the value of this to the success of its customers, the Airport Authority Hong Kong pioneered the world's first CEIV Fresh certified airport community."</p>
      <p>Fred Lam, chief executive, Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK), said: "We are delighted to be the first airport community worldwide recognised by IATA under the CEIV Fresh programme, which is a big encouragement to and affirmation of the capability of the Hong Kong airport community in handling perishable products.</p>
      <p>"HKIA is the world's busiest cargo airport since 2010. With the new certification, HKIA is well-placed to capture the increasing growth opportunities in the market for fresh and perishable goods."</p>
      <p>In 2018, HKIA handled over 380,000 tonnes of perishables, accounting for about 8% of the total cargo volume of HKIA, marking a year-on-year increase of 12% from 2017.</p>
      <p>To support the continuous growth, AAHK said it would ensure high-quality specialty facilities and services are available for perishable air cargo. It is  providing additional cool dollies to make a total of over 30 for use by the whole airport community and is also building apron shelters to protect the perishables from ambient weather elements.</p>
      <p>The two cargo terminal operators, meanwhile, offer cold rooms set at tailored temperatures for various kinds of perishable cargo, such as live seafood, fruits and vegetables, and frozen meat.</p>
      <p>Their staff training and handling process have also been assessed and certified for their compliance with the global industry standards.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific's director commercial and Cargo Ronald Lam said: "Congratulations to CPSL. IATA's CEIV Fresh certification is an achievement that our airline aims to emulate in the near future.</p>
      <p>"A collaborative approach among all stakeholders enables the airfreight community to provide meticulous care for fresh produce during transit. It will not only provide superior value to our customers but also contribute to the success of Hong Kong as a key international airfreight hub for perishables."</p>
      <p>The programme was revealed at an IATA media day in December 2017.</p>

      <p>Air cargo IT provider CHAMP Cargosystems has extended the scope of its Traxon Global Customs (TGC) solution to freight forwarders in response to a change in freight filing regulations by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).  The third phase of the CBSA's Advance Commercial Information program (ACI) — eManifest — makes it compulsory for forwarders to provide advance electronic transmission of customs and clearance. The CBSA is the first Customs authority that has required forwarder direct filing. The programme will have a phased transitional launch for eManifest adoption (see below). CHAMP's TGC, which has a direct connection to CBSA, is a universal Customs solution for airlines, handlers and forwarders to report electronically to Customs authorities in over 40 countries.  TGC is a single interface application, and pre-alerts users in case of missing data or errors prior to reporting. A full audit trail is available that tracks all messages sent and received for Customs reporting, which enables users to easily proof their reporting. Nicholas Xenocostas, vice president, global sales and marketing at CHAMP Cargosystems, said: "With changing regulations comes a demand to expand our services to meet our customers' needs. "The trend to fully automated, paperless Customs makes TGC more relevant than ever. We are adapting our solution to meet the needs of this new market." CBSA phased launch dates:</p>

      <p>The foundation piles have been placed for a new logistics building on the west side of Brucargo, with direct access to the tarmac.</p>
      <p>The construction at Brussels Airport is part of a €100 million investment in the modernisation of Brucargo.</p>
      <p>The building will be completed in the course of 2020 and can then be taken into use by the tenants Kuehne + Nagel, Worldwide Flight Services and Expeditors.</p>
      <p>Construction also incorporates various sustainability aspects including a green roof and solar panels on the office block.</p>
      <p>The buildings will be economical with water thanks to the installation of a water infiltration system and rainwater wells to reuse rainwater.</p>
      <p>The building will also be equipped with LED lighting and heat pumps.</p>
      <p>To improve mobility at the airport, charging stations for electric vehicles will be installed, together with two additional bus stops and a new cycle path in the area.</p>
      <p>The symbolic laying of the first stone took place in the presence of Marc Grootjans, mayor of Machelen, and the CEOs of the three future tenants.</p>
      <p>Arnaud Feist, CEO of Brussels Airport Company says the airport is increasing the handling space on offer, particularly refrigerated storage.</p>
      <p>He says: "These temperature-controlled rooms are not only of considerable importance for various key sectors in our country including biotech and pharmaceuticals, but also for the import and export of fresh and perishable goods. Two niche markets in which Brussels Airport is specialised and in which it is investing further."</p>

      <p>Virgin Atlantic Cargo and Delta Cargo are introducing a new pharma zone at their joint facility at London Heathrow. The new pharma zone will support the growing volumes of temperature-controlled healthcare and life science products being carried by both airlines and enhances their ability to meet the strict quality and service requirements of pharmaceutical companies and their freight forwarding partners.</p>
      <p>The pharma zone, which opened on October 2, is a fully segregated area dedicated to handling and storing pharmaceutical shipments within a strictly regulated temperature environment with dedicated active container storage.</p>
      <p>Darren Sherlock, Manager, products and partnerships at Virgin Atlantic Cargo, who has led the pharma zone project, said, "The opening of the pharma zone is the latest enhancement to the pharma products of both airlines. This has also recently seen Delta Cargo become the first US global passenger carrier to gain IATA's CEIV Pharma Logistics certification corporately and at its Atlanta operational hub, while Virgin Atlantic Cargo is on track to achieve Wholesale Distribution Authorisation (WDA) certification in the UK by the end of the year to confirm our GDP compliance. This reflects our joint commitment to delivering the correct level of service required for temperature-controlled pharma products at both origin and destination points across our networks."</p>
      <p>"This dedicated pharma facility at London Heathrow is an important addition to our global pharma network and, most importantly, provides our customers and pharmaceutical manufacturers access to another major international gateway. Delta Cargo has successfully achieved CEIV certification in Atlanta and for Delta's headquarters. Over the next year we aim to add our other key hubs to the network, starting with New York-JFK and Los Angeles," said Shawn Cole, Vice President-Delta Cargo. "This network, combined with the promise of speed, consistency and efficiency in delivering high-value, time-sensitive, temperature-controlled products right across the network really is a first for the Delta Cargo and Virgin Atlantic Cargo joint venture."</p>
      <p>Incorporated into the new Pharma facility are two walk-in pods capable of maintaining 2-8°C (COL) and 15-25°C (CRT) temperature ranges for loose pharma shipments. High above the floor of the Pharma Zone for added security is a temperature-controlled storage system for 24 pallets, split into 6 separate chambers, each of which can be safely maintained within either a 2-8°C or 15-25°C temperature range. Other special features include a cargo door dedicated to pharma shipments to speed their flow through the warehouse and reduce the time products spend outside of a temperature controlled environment, and 10 charging points for active cargo containers.</p>
      <p>Good Distribution Practice (GDP) training has also been delivered to the team of specialists working in the Pharma Zone.</p>
      <p>Virgin Atlantic Cargo and Delta Cargo now offer around 24 per cent of the total cargo capacity between the UK and the United States, the world's biggest trade lane for pharmaceutical products.</p>
      <p>Dominic Kennedy, managing director, Virgin Atlantic Cargo, said, "Our pharma tonnage grew by 20 per cent in the first half of 2017 and we expect this to increase as we continue to invest in, and develop, facilities like our new pharma zone as well as GDP processes and training across our network. In terms of our pharma and life sciences offering, we believe our size, alongside direct Virgin oversight at every single station, gives us a real advantage in terms of the agility and flexibility we can offer and our growing volumes indicate our customers share this view. I also wish to acknowledge the strong commitment of dnata, our handling partner at Heathrow, for enabling us to deliver yet another significant benefit for our customers, who remain at the heart of everything we do."</p>

    <content>
      <p>Finnair's new €80 million COOL Nordic cargo hub was officially opened in early December, with the centre becoming operational on January 8, 2018. The centre has been branded COOL for its modern technology and capacity to handle high volumes of temperature-controlled cargo.</p>
      <p>At the sparkling, frosty-themed opening, attended by Finland's minister of transport and communications Anne Berner, guests from over 15 countries were introduced to the new terminal's most striking features, including the new high-tech Cargo Control Center (CCC) that intelligently manages and optimises the flow of goods and steers the performance of the hub.</p>
      <p>Guests also got exclusive access to see Cargo Eye, a new operations monitoring and tracking platform developed by Qoco Systems, that gives the CCC a live, 360-degree view of what is happening across the cargo network and where everything is located.</p>
      <p>Cargo Eye collects live data from all Finnair Cargo's information and tracking systems, such as the global position of aircrafts, flight information, the geographic location of cargo ground traffic, and key data from SkyChain, Finnair's cargo management system developed by Accelya .</p>
      <p>"Thanks to Cargo Eye, from the Control Center in the new COOL terminal we can see where every truck and plane carrying, for example, seafood or pharmaceuticals is located, receive the latest information about cargo arrivals and connecting transport, monitor contents and temperature, and be ready to shift ground resources to where they are needed most in anticipation of delivery," says Janne Tarvainen, Finnair cargo managing director,</p>

      <p>Jettainer is developing a lightweight pallet that weighs 70 kg, around 32 kg lighter than a traditional PMC aluminium unit. The Germany-based ULD management company says that the pallet is made of a composite material that is being applied for the first time in the aviation sector. It offers an alternative to using thinner aluminium bases in order to reduce weight. The drawback with thinner bases is that they have to be specially reinforced when transporting heavy items. Said Jettainer: "The particularly tough and stable material used for the new kind of pallet, manufactured with a sandwich design, is suitable for most cases without the need to use heavy-duty bases to stabilise the load. This ensures that the total weight is once again significantly lower." Jettainer is working exclusively with several partners in the development of the new lightweight pallet. The initial trial phase has already been completed. A long-term test is taking place this month, within the context of selected road feeder services – initially in trucks with a roller bed – in order to obtain as realistic load results as possible. "Our innovative products are being comprehensively tested in real conditions so that we can even use our customers' feedback during the development phase," says Carsten Hernig, managing director of Jettainer, a Lufthansa Cargo subsidiary. He adds: "In the end we want to offer our customers a globally unique and perfect product that will only be available from Jettainer." Certification by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is due to take place in mid-2015. After this, the new lightweight pallets will create "significant fuel savings in the aviation sector". Jettainer has also introduced an upgrade for the company's own IT solution, Jettware, for managing customers' ULDs. The new version, Jettware 2.0, "promises to provide a higher degree of user-friendliness, improved data quality and therefore greater efficiency" said Jettainer.  Did you find this article of interest, if so why not register for a FREE digital subscription to Air Cargo News? – Find out more</p>

      <p>Yesterday, Brussels Airport (BRU) launched its first blockchain-enabled application, which will work in conjunction with its cloud-based data management platform, BRUcloud, that was rolled out in January of this year.</p>
      <p>The addition of blockchain technology to the app will centralize client communication, replacing individual "system-to-system connections with all different partners," said Sara Van Gelder, cargo business development manager at the airport.</p>
      <p>BRUcloud provides a platform for forwarders to request ad hoc delivery slots and reserve a recurring time slot – which Air Cargo World wrote about in depth in May, following a panel discussion at Cargo Facts Asia.</p>
      <p>In an update of the app, forwarders will now be able to manage communications with handlers digitally, replacing the old paper-based process.</p>
      <p>The airport named DHL Global Forwarding and ground handler WFS as partners and fellow advocates of BRU's foray into blockchain. David Bellon, DHL-GF's airfreight director, commented that the air cargo industry needs to increase its efforts in digitizing its processes, "to create transparency and real-time visibility."</p>
      <p>The overdue digitalization of airfreight processes has been talked about at length in recent years. As far as the reception of the app is concerned, it won the airport's "IT solution of the year" award at the Air Cargo China conference last month.</p>

      <p>Liege Airport is to employ the Nallian for Air Cargo suite, a data-sharing platform topped by a set of collaborative applications. It will empower Liege Airport and its cargo stakeholders to operate in an integrated way that generates business benefits. A data lake will allow the airport to further maximize the value of this shared data, enabling in-depth analysis that helps them to better understand their cargo streams and make informed decisions.</p>
      <p>With an annual volume of more than 700.000 tonnes, Liege Airport is launching a cloud-based platform that enables its stakeholders to operate in a more collaborative, integrated way. Single data-entry and secure data-exchange are key in this innovative digitalisation project that makes way with traditional, inefficient one-to-one communication and information siloes.</p>
      <p>Using Nallian's open data sharing platform, information that is uploaded once can be shared in a secured, controlled way with other parties. A set of collaborative applications enables to capture and share this single version of the truth in a wide range of processes. Liege Airport is starting off with 6 applications: slot booking, export VAT recovery, freight consolidation, e-commerce declaration, cargo performance monitoring, and track &amp; trace. These have already proven to generate significant benefits in terms of time savings, performance increase and process predictability in other implementations.</p>
      <p>A data lake will be fueled with information from these applications, allowing the airport to, amongst others, analyze freight routes in much more detail, using a set of parameters such as freight origin or final destination, commodities, airline, transport mode etc. Gaining better insights in its cargo streams will allow the airport to make strategic decisions based on real-world information.</p>
      <p>Liege Airport vp air services Franz Heuckeroth Van Hessen says: "Nallian's unique approach of an open data sharing platform empowering collaborative applications gives our business the agility it needs to remain ahead of the game, today and tomorrow. It allows us immediately reap the benefits with our first set of applications in a range of processes, with the flexibility to quickly scale and add more applications in the future. We have been impressed by the proven performance of the platform, and are convinced it will generate significant value for the airport and our stakeholders."</p>
      <p>Nallian CEO Jean Verheyen says: "Liege Airport is a pioneer in the air cargo industry and we are proud to support them in their ambition to take their business and the air cargo sector to the next level. Our Nallian for Air Cargo Suite has been developed for and by Air Cargo leaders like them, so we are pleased to be able to support their long-term vision with a platform that is tuned to their reality."</p>

      <p>The stakeholders in pharma supply chain are ensuring that they meet the growing need of standardisation and transparency to ensure regulatory adherence and no excursions. The investments made by IATA CEIV Pharma Certified companies have brought significant changes on how the temperature controlled pharmaceutical products are handled at airport and transported by airlines, instilling trust back in the industry.</p>
      <p>Nahida Jafferi</p>
      <p>In 2017, the global pharmaceutical market stood at $934.8 billion, growing at a CAGR of 5.8 percent.  It is expected to reach $1,170 billion by 2021.</p>
      <p>Pharmaceuticals make up 1.9 percent of all air cargo volumes flown by air and contribute 2.6 percent of total airline cargo revenues.  Andrea Gruber, head, special cargo, IATA, said, "Global trends show that spending on pharmaceuticals is likely to increase by low to mid-single digits in developed markets and low-double digits in developing and emerging markets. However, growth in the value of pharmaceuticals trade will be more modest due to highly regulated localised markets and entry barriers. In the three years ahead (2018-2020), volume growth in pharmaceuticals is expected to be 3.7 percent, despite lower than overall air cargo volume growth, the higher premiums of pharmaceutical shipments and the investments in personalised medicine mean that they will still generate an increasing share of air cargo revenues."</p>
      <p>Although high-end pharma mostly goes by air, pharma logistics is a competitive sector across all transport modes. It is to be seen whether air with all its efforts in reducing excursions and the cost extensiveness, can grab a bigger chunk of the market mainly dominated by sea. "The competition from other transport modes has pushed our industry to react and improve with the aim to become a modal choice based on the business model of a company rather than to be the mode of transport of no choice but air freight. Finally regulations and standards, such as IATA CEIV Pharma, have served to shore up confidence among shippers to rely on air cargo," stated Gruber.</p>

      <p>For Serum Institute of India- the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, 100 percent of exports is done by air. Highlighting some of the difficulties Vishal Lobo, manager-exports, Serum Institute of India, said, "Tracking of products to ensure supply chain visibility, products exposed to a wide range of temperature extremes during their journey, and adherence to and compliance with worldwide regulations, are some of the challenges in pharma supply chain."</p>
      <p>He, however, added that positive changes are being made in the pharma supply chain. "Airlines and forwarders have started recruiting staff with a pharmacy background. They have also created pharma verticals to handle customers. They work on joint ventures with specialised pharma packaging companies to provide solutions as per the regulated market. Investments in training staff for the handling of pharma shipment and its implementation is also gaining momentum," added Lobo.</p>
      <p>Lobo also pointed towards the need for cross-functional and cross-company efforts to eliminate bottlenecks and increase responsiveness. He mentioned, "Proper infrastructure planning to deliver desired results, in addition to ease of transactions and flow of communication within supply chain, is expected from the stakeholders in the pharma supply chain."</p>
      <p>Many parts of air freight and pharma handling are very manual. Increasing regulatory demands and continued volume growth in cold chain logistics worldwide is spurring significant development in smart solutions for tracking and monitoring pharma from origin to destination.</p>
      <p>In Singapore- a leading biomedical hub in Asia, more than 75 percent of the total value of pharmaceutical products are transported via airfreight. Lim Ching Kiat, managing director, Air Hub Development, Changi Airport, said, "Eight of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world have established facilities in Singapore, with Singapore manufacturing four of the top 10 drugs (in terms of global revenue). For the first half of 2018, Changi Airport saw a 10 percent growth in pharmaceuticals cargo as compared the same period last year."</p>
      <p>"Changi Airport remains a major conduit for pharmaceuticals trade flows on routes between North Asia and the South Asia, Southwest Pacific and Europe regions. From January to June 2018, strong growth export markets include Indonesia and the Netherlands," added Lim.</p>
      <p>According to an IATA report, more than 50 percent of all temperature excursions occur at airports and inside airlines. Changi Airport has undergone the IATA CEIV Pharma certification, besides certifications like GDP and ISO standards to ensure proper standards are maintained. In a bid to prevent falsified medicines from entering supply chain, the airport's business partners follow international standards such as those under the Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA) for their facilities and trucking operations. Lim also added that pharmaceutical shipments are the last cargo to leave the cold chain warehouse for loading onto the aircraft. For pharmaceuticals that have a short transhipment duration in Changi, on-tarmac chillers are used to keep sensitive cargo away from high temperatures.</p>
      <p>Changi Airport also formalised the Pharma@Changi initiative in October last year, working with nine other partners from the air cargo supply chain towards the continuous strengthening of Changi's capabilities to handle pharmaceutical air cargo. "According to the statistics by Singapore's Economic Development Board, Changi Airport is also co-leading Pharma.Aero's digitisation project, which aims to develop a demo for a common data sharing platform, where relevant information across shareholders in the supply chain can be shared and translated into valuable insights," informed Lim.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in India, the Air India-SATS (AISATS) COOLPORT at Kempegowda International Airport has been developed as a one-stop-shop for temperature-sensitive cargo and the presence of onsite facilities such as Drug Controller Lab Testing, Plant Quarantine Inspection &amp; Certification and Custom Clearances help to reduce cargo dwell-time and fasten the overall cargo movement. Furthermore, the AISATS COOLPORT has also started reefer trucking services to major cities in South and Central India in order to ensure temperature-controlled delivery of cargo.</p>
      <p>Mike Chew, CEO, AISATS, said, "Due to a strong generic pharma industry in India, strategic sourcing of raw materials from domestic and foreign sources, and low-cost innovation and production of generic drugs, India is able to supply affordable, high-quality pharmaceuticals to the global market. These cost benefits have led to an increased demand of Indian pharmaceuticals in the international markets, which has subsequently led to an increase in exports of Indian pharmaceutical products to the value of $17.3 billion in 2017-18."</p>
      <p>"AISATS handled around 3000 tonnes of pharmaceutical cargo at its COOLPORT facility in FY 2017-18. In the first quarter of 2018-19, AISATS has managed around 930 tonnes of pharmaceutical cargo compared to 430 tonnes during the same period in the previous financial year. With the surge in movement of perishable cargo, AISATS has witnessed an overall y-o-y growth of around 120 percent," said Chew.</p>
      <p>For Finnair Cargo, the main project in 2017 was the COOL Nordic Cargo Hub at Helsinki- the most modern air cargo terminal in Europe, which was opened in two phases and built, in part, to fulfil the needs of customers shipping temperature controlled cargo such as pharmaceuticals or perishables.</p>
      <p>"Our pharma growth is linked closely with the growth of Finnair as an airline, but the new COOL terminal has significantly boosted our credentials with pharma shippers. It also means that we can handle a lot more cargo, and do so while ensuring the quality requirements of various types of shipments are met in accordance with shipper's instructions," informed Fredrik Wildtgrube, head of global sales, Finnair Cargo.</p>
      <p>In the first half of this year Finnair saw a 40 percent increase in pharma shipments compared to H1 2017. "Pharma is a significant revenue stream that has seen the strongest growth in recent years. The key countries for us are of course Finland and Sweden in our Nordic home market, and Belgium that is served with enhanced connectivity to/from Brussels. In Asia, India is a key market in terms of pharma," said Wildtgrube. "Although the temperature history can be retrieved from tracking device after the flight, the cargo operator has strategised to introduce real-time temperature monitoring of pharma during flights in near future," he added.</p>
      <p>Swiss World Cargo, the air cargo division of Swiss International Airlines, has gained its CEIV-Pharma certification that ensures that all segments of its supply chain network, operating in more than 84 countries, meet the strict temperature-control standards set by IATA. Swiss World Cargo is also recognised as compliant with the Good Distribution Practices (GDP) standards.</p>
      <p>LATAM Cargo is the first airline in the American continent to receive the CEIV Pharma Certification in 2017. "Since then, we have also certified our MIA hub, and we are now looking at certifying other important pharma hubs for us in Latin America," said Cristina Oñate, VP marketing and product development, LATAM Cargo. She further added, "We are currently expanding our pharma stations in Europe. On September 1st, it recently launched its tenth hub in Copenhagen airport which will help the Danish pharmaceutical industry to have a better option to get their medicines to patients all over Latin America.</p>
      <p>About growth figures, Rodolfo Marre, development senior manager, LATAM Cargo, informed, "During 2017, we handled approximately 2,500 tonnes of pharmaceuticals, and so far, we have transported around 1,900tonnes of pharmaceuticals from, to and intra Latin America. Pharmaceuticals contribute around a three percent of our overall cargo business. The best performing routes are Chicago (ORD)- Sao Paolo(GRU), Miami (MIA)-GRU and Milan (MXP)-GRU."</p>
      <p>LATAM Cargo is upgrading air cargo services for the life sciences industry with the recent adoption of advanced air cargo tracking system that will in future target pharma cold-chain tracking capability as well. Marre highlighted, "We are in permanent touch with clients and benchmarking that we have the technology needed for delivering our standard. We are currently improving the real-time monitoring of our cold rooms in our network. This will enable us to react faster and prevent any problems with the temperature control."</p>
      <p>As a result of increasing investments in pharma services, AF-KLM Martinair Cargo has witnessed increase in pharmaceutical logistics in 2018, which now represents more than 10 percent of the total sales.</p>
      <p>"AF-KLM Martinair Cargo has made investments this year in the Pharma sector: at our hub Amsterdam Schiphol, we invested in a state-of-the-art Pharma Containers Conveyor, a fully automated palletized system, capable of handling over 100 electrical or dry ice containers at the time. We also implemented CO2 detectors in our hubs in Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol so that we can safely store 'controlled shipments' in combination with Dangerous Goods, including ICE and Lithium Batteries," informed Enrica Calonghi, director verticals, global head pharmaceutical logistics, AF-KLM Martinair Cargo.</p>
      <p>AF-KLM believes that digitisation will be making pharmaceutical logistics more efficient and customer-centric. "We have recently launched myCargo portal that allows our customers to get quotations, and information about the latest and best deals todo their bookings. For Active containers solutions, customers can use myCargo to track the temperature, level of battery during the transit of the containers in Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and in Paris Charles de Gaulle. AF- KLM Cargo is looking at blockchain as enabler to ensure the cool chain and to track pharmaceuticals from the point of origin to the consumer," said Calonghi.</p>
      <p>AF-KLM considers the IATA CEIV certification as a basis for a continuous improvement process. Being GDP compliant and CEIV certified means a great level of investment in time, processes and continuous improvement.</p>
      <p>According to a study carried out by the French office of Air Charter Service in 2017 on airport quality, Luxembourg and Paris-Vatry were named the most efficient airports for cargo worldwide. Health care products represented five percent of Paris-Vatry Airport's global cargo business in 2017. Yoann Maugran, cargo sales manager, Paris-Vatry Airport, said, "We mainly handle full freighters on Charter basis with big volumes every year. In terms of aircraft movements, the figure doubled in five years."</p>
      <p>Maugran added, "We proved to the French pharma community our know how in the handling of healthcare products. What we expect from the pharma supply chain stakeholders is that they keep in mind that regional airports have valuable assets, and are sometimes more reactive and proactive than big hub."</p>
      <p>Paris-Vatry is committed to get the CEIV Pharma certification. "We look at data sharing solutions to bring transparency in the supply chain. In terms of collaborative thinking, we have launched an initiative together with two other French provincial airports, to share good practices in the handling of pharma products, and find ways of collaboration and synergies between our platforms," said Maugran.</p>
      <p>photo:  Air Canada cargo</p>
      <p>Maugran also informed that Paris-Vatry has good prospects to start a new cargo service towards Western Africa end of this year or beginning of next year. The airport saw a 134 percent overall tonnage growth in 2017 over the same period in 2016. "This was due to efforts overseas to promote the platform and the arrival of regular operations with companies for tech stops from Etihad Airways; Kalitta Air, and import/export operations via AirBridgeCargo in addition to charter flights," said Maugran.</p>
      <p>Delta Cargo is also taking proactive steps toward eliminating irregularities in the pharma air freight.   Lindsey Jalil, managing director-commercial, Delta Cargo, said, "Delta has CEIV certification in Atlanta, our largest hub, and are now looking at expanding our facilities and capabilities at some of our North American hubs, including New York-JFK.  We are also expanding our temperature controlled warehousing space in Atlanta with construction underway, we anticipate this to be completed by early October with 30,000 square feet more of 15-25C warehouse space."</p>
      <p>"The trans-Atlantic continues to be one of the best performing markets for us.  We have experienced our largest amounts of growth from the UK, Ireland and Spain.  The UK is supported by our new Pharma Zone at London Heathrow with our partner Virgin Atlantic Cargo," informed Jalil.</p>
      <p>Delta recently announced that all Delta products can be booked online on Deltcargo.com.  This allows the customer to enter in their precise details and requirements, and ensures that an airline has all of the information needed to get the job done properly.</p>
      <p>After successfully undergoing a rigorous assessment against IATA's Temperature Control Regulations, IATA has recognised LUG aircargo handling (Frankfurt) as CEIV Pharma Certified in August 2018. Dominik Misskampf, senior project manager and manager, health care centre, LUG aircargo handling, said, "At LUG, we have seen a continuous rise in temperature and time sensitive shipments over the years. Due to a change in our customer portfolio the type of cargo handled in our facilities has changed too. As a result, our volume of temperature sensitive goods has almost tripled this year compared to the same period in 2017."</p>
      <p>To meet the increase in demand for pharma, the IATA CEIV certified- Health Care Center at the LUG Terminal in the Cargo City South Frankfurt, which covers 625 square metre, is being further expanded by another 190 square metre. "Building work has commenced already. Currently seven rooms of different sizes offer storage at temperatures ranging from &lt;-18°C and 2-8°C to 15-25°C. As the temperature of the single rooms can be adjusted, we are able to meet different operational needs even in the long run. Moreover, a dedicated team is in charge for the handling of pharmaceuticals," informed Misskampf.</p>

      <p>Misskampf further added that LUG aims to develop additional services in collaboration with its customers, as well as selected forwarding-agents and shippers. It also participates in the pharma working group of the Air Cargo Community Frankfurt that aims to optimize the overall supply chain at Frankfurt Airport.</p>
      <p>"Technical innovations such as new temperature controlled ULD, passive thermal boxes, tc tarmac transportation, dolly blankets, special foil, and sensors offer more end-to-end controls, monitoring, and security of temperature integrity and strengthen the position of airfreight in the supply chain. They also help to reducing damages," he added.</p>
      <p>Turkish Cargo, as an airline and warehouse operator, is closely following technological and infrastructural developments for pharmaceutical business worldwide. Its increase in service quality by completion of IATA CEIV Pharma certification process in August 2016 at its Istanbul hub has brought a growth rate of 65 percent. Pharma air cargo shipments increased by 50 percent this year compared to the same period last year. Turkish Cargo's annual pharma air cargo tonnage has also been developing steadily.</p>
      <p>The cargo operator plans to build a bigger dedicated pharma facility via the Istanbul New Airport project and also targets to be the major transit pharma hub between Asia and Europe. The pharma facility currently includes Constant Climate acceptance area without breaking the cold chain, 5,000 square metre operation area isolated from other cargo where +5 and +20 degrees temperature is provided to perform the operation without breaking the cold chain and Cool Cells for ULD Storage.</p>
      <p>To mitigate the temperature excursions, Brussels Airport has recently increased the number of temperature controlled pharma transport dollies from 4 to 9, allowing the airlines operating at the airport to develop and offer specific pharma handling services for forwarders and pharma shippers.  The temperature data of the shipments inside the pharma dollies is constantly monitored and could be made available via the BRUcloud based booking platform and management tool.</p>
      <p>"Creating a neutral data sharing platform like the BRUcloud is a prerequisite to enable the different stakeholders to work more 'integrated' and act as a network. The Pharma Quality dashboard app was launched two years ago and has recorded the quality handling data of up to 30,000 pharma shipments.  This vast data pool allows the local pharma working group to analyse the root causes of the irregularities and implement corrective actions on a cargo community level.  It has resulted in a 40 percent reduction of quality irregularities," mentioned Nathan De Valck, cargo and product development manager, Brussels Airport.</p>
      <p>Also, the Pharma.Aero initiative- the global collaboration group of pharmaceutical shippers and airport communities endorsing the pharma CEIV standards, has gained momentum and Brussels Airport is taking a leading role by chairing the group.  "The most recent project focusses on how to create transparency in the air cargo pharma supply chain by sharing data on a data platform.  This project on data transparency will actually be implemented in the next 6 months on three pilot pharma corridors where BRU is involved.  Pharma shippers, airlines and handlers are actively involved in the project group," informed Valck.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport is the preferred European Life Science and MedTech Gateway. Valck also emphasised that Brussels Airport has seen continuous growth rates over the past few years ranging between 15 percent and 24 percent on a yearly basis for the export flown cargo in the pharma segment.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Anand Yedery, regional cargo manager – South Asia, ME &amp; Africa, Cathay Pacific also called for industry collaboration. He pointed that the use of differing standards between supply chain partners compromises product integrity.</p>
      <p>Cathay Pacific is the first airline in Hong Kong to be awarded IATA CEIV Pharma Certification. In addition to other airport stakeholders in Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Services Limited (CPSL) – a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific which operates the Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal, and Hong Kong Airport Services Ltd (HAS) – another wholly-owned subsidiary which provides ground handling services to airlines, have also been awarded CEIV Pharma Certification.</p>
      <p>"This collaborative approach will boost Hong Kong's reputation as a key international airfreight gateway for the handling of pharmaceutical products," asserted Yedery.</p>
      <p>Talking about the growth markets in the pharma segment, Yedery added, "The pharma industry has seen double digit growth in India over the years. Hyderabad, India's fourth most populous city and, an important hub for the technology and pharmaceutical industries account for around one-third of the country's drug production. We see a strong demand for our specialised Pharma LIFT products and services. Cathay Pacific is also seeing huge tonnage growth from Bengaluru and Mumbai, compared to last year."</p>
      <p>Cathay Pacific has entered into a number of strategic alliances and partnerships for better serving its clients. Pharmaceutical shippers are able to lease PharmaPort 360 temperature-controlled bulk shipping containers directly from Cathay Pacific Cargo through its partnership with Sonoco ThermoSafe. The PharmaPort 360 utilises proprietary hybrid technology to ensure extremely precise +5C temperature control.</p>
      <p>LATAM Cargo</p>
      <p>Digital capabilities are being considered in the use of containers and already implemented. Track and trace capabilities with real-time information is existing in the pharmaceutical environment. "The future of IATA's interactive cargo aims at developing responsive air cargo services based on intelligent systems that are able to self-monitor, send real-time alerts, respond to deviation to meet customers' expectations and report on the cargo journey to allow data-driven improvements. With tracking at piece level, using sensors and data loggers will also impact the pharmaceutical shipments," stated Gruber.</p>
      <p>Talking about technology and digital container for pharma shipments, Carolyn Van Vliet - Manager, Cargo Products Business Development, Air Canada Cargo, pointed, "Most of the active or advance-passive container/packaging companies currently have ability to capture data (location, internal and external temperatures, etc.) for which we have access.  We are exploring the ability to integrate this data with our operating systems to improve our overall transparency with our track and trace capabilities.  In addition, other container companies such as Unilode are also enhancing their assets to incorporate such data capabilities. We are very excited about this."</p>
      <p>Pharmaceutical shipments represent approximately 16 percent of Air Canada Cargo's cool chain shipments.</p>
      <p>Vliet said, "Our strategy for pharma logistics will involve a revamped product offering in the coming months and into 2019 for its passive shipments.  The key components will feature very clear definitions of our temperature management offering – enhanced temperature storage facilities throughout our global network which currently spans 6 continents; more effective use of technology to improve visibility and transparency of our handling processes, renewed focus on quality and training to ensure more pro-active and preventive activities and of course, the pursuit of industry certifications such as IATA's CEIV Pharma certification."</p>

      <p>BUDAPEST — Steve Polmans is not stuck in the proverbial "black hole," a term coined to describe the murky intersection of forwarders, ground handlers, carriers and other airfreight companies at airports around the world. Brussels Airport walked into the light a few years back, he said, with the implementation of its airport community, which now serves as a guidepost for other airports looking to enhance their operations.</p>
      <p>"Closer cooperation is changing the business, and we are seeing the benefits," said the head of Brussels Cargo to a panel here at the fifth Pharma &amp; Bioscience Conference.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most effective tool of standardization to date is CEIV accreditation, which forces airfreight companies of all stripes to align their practices with the body's standards. Collaboration benefits us by having us work together as a group, said Gino Vleugels, senior manager of EMEA temperature control at Johnson &amp; Johnson. "CEIV allows us to trust another party's audits," he said. "We can extend our network by trusting other parties that are certified."</p>
      <p>"Even if we are the best in Europe, it doesn't matter if the other end isn't up to our standards," said Polmans. With standards now established, it will be easier for other airports to follow Brussels Airport's lead. The next step will be going to more remote airports, to ensure that proper handling at origin airports translates into pristine deliveries at the final destination. "It needs to be an end-to-end solution," Polmans said.</p>
      <p>But with the benefits of standards established, groups like Pharma.aero are working to implement them on a global level. "CEIV is well established in Europe," said Jaisey Yip, associate general manager of cargo and logistics, and air hub innovation at Changi Airport in Singapore. "But it's just starting to make its way to Asia, in terms of the uniformity and awareness – it's moving towards harmonization."</p>
      <p>Below: panelist Nina Heinz, global head of network and quality temperature management solutions for DHL Global Forwarding talks about controlling a shipment at the destination airport:</p>

      <p>As consumers continue to demand ever-faster delivery and greater visibility in a marketplace driven by e-commerce, UPS has launched its new UPS My Choice for business service.</p>
      <p>The tool is the first visibility and tracking solution in the US that has been designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and builds on the success of the UPS My Choice for home platform that was launched in 2011.</p>
      <p>Commercial customers can now benefit from greater transparency and forecasting, enabling them to save time, manage staffing levels, reduce inventory carrying costs and improve customer service.</p>
      <p>UPS said in a statement: "The mobile-friendly solution addresses significant pain points for SMBs. Self-registration enables shippers and receivers to more easily monitor, plan, react to and control their incoming deliveries and outgoing shipments. Users can share access with additional members of their organisations, giving them the same visibility and control over deliveries."</p>
      <p>Features of My Choice for business include an Internet-based tracking dashboard; advance delivery notifications, including day-before and day-of-delivery notifications; and estimated time of delivery within two-hour windows for the majority of US postal codes.</p>
      <p>"Additional features to be rolled out later this year include delivery change options for increased delivery flexibility and a new delivery alert which lets receivers know when the driver is nearby or within a very short time window of delivery from 1 hour to just 15 minutes away," UPS said.</p>
      <p>Available now to US customers, My Choice for business will be rolled out internationally in early 2020.</p>

      <p>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and KLM Cargo have given their support to a new same-day intra-European air cargo service. The same-day intra-European air cargo delivery is the responsibility of a start-up called 12send, of which Dutch company Parcel International is the majority stakeholder. KLM Cargo and Schiphol Cargo also contributed to the development and launch of the service. 12send makes use of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol's baggage system and KLM's European network, and both Schiphol Cargo and KLM Cargo have backed the service, following a successful trial in October on KLM services between Amsterdam and Barcelona-El Prat Airport in Spain. Cargo shipped on 12send will be loaded at Schiphol and then flown to KLM destinations across Europe. Dutch company Parcel International handles the first and last mile deliveries, moving the shipment to the end-customer by electric van or e-bike. "Same-day delivery is soon to be a standard, and as Europe's leading e-commerce hub, we have backed an innovative high-end service which is also CO2 responsible," informed Jonas van Stekelenburg, head of cargo at Schiphol Cargo. "Schiphol has a world-class baggage system which is fast, secure, and seamless, and working with KLM's efficient network and Parcel International's e-commerce expertise we are confident 12send will be a valuable enlargement of European air freight services, and meet the growing needs of our air freight partners." Marcel de Nooijer, executive vice president for KLM Cargo and managing director of Martinair Holland, said that the service sets a new standard in terms of cross-border delivery. "With the belly capacity of KLM's broad European passenger network we offer great solutions for all customers in the rapidly growing cross-border e-commerce market and the trend towards delivery within 24 hours. "We are glad to develop this service together with Parcel International and Schiphol Airport and set a new standard in terms of cross-border same day delivery in Europe." Finally, Casper Plat, a partner at Parcel International, noted that customers ordering goods such as fast fashion and books want a same-day service but often have to wait for next day delivery via truck. But: "Thanks to 12send, same-day delivery of e-commerce goods is now possible in the whole of Europe by harnessing otherwise unused cargo capacity of passenger planes," he said. "This means we can provide an "ordered before noon, delivered before 11pm" service all over the continent. "The partnership between Schiphol, KLM, and Parcel International joins our strengths to the benefit of our customers, who are demanding shorter and shorter fulfilment times," Plat added. Parcel International aims to have 12send operational to 20 European cities in coming years. Schiphol Airport is the third-largest air cargo hub in Europe, having handled 1.6 million tonnes of freight last year.  The gateway has 525,000 sq m of cargo warehouses, of which 40% have direct airside access.</p>

      <p>A new report from DHL Global Forwarding and American Airlines Cargo has outlined the investments the logistics industry needs to make to prepare for the growth of personalised medicines in Latin America.</p>
      <p>The report "Patients, Processes and Partnerships: The Path to Personalized Medicine in Latin America" looks at the future of medical logistics in the Latin American region and four key solutions to support the development.</p>
      <p>The report found that the challenge in Latin America is extra complex as there are no regional standards for medical shipments, so each logistics provider must work to meet each country's regulations, such as sterilisation labeling, transportation modes in varied terrains, accessibility to well-equipped facilities and qualified doctors.</p>
      <p>Economic and political stability also play important roles in how healthcare is delivered within countries. Also not all residents have equal access to the same resources: hospitals, medical personnel, technology, or even simple Internet access.</p>
      <p>"As an industry, we must invest in new technology and next-gen solutions, including intelligent IT networks, big data analytics and AI, but also in our people and processes to ensure we can deliver what our customers need more effectively, efficiently and precisely," said Roger Samways, Vice President, Sales, American Airlines Cargo.</p>
      <p>"By working hand in hand with medical professionals, corporations and governments, logistics and supply chain professionals can begin to solve the personalised medicine puzzle that is coming."</p>
      <p>"With personalised medicine, companies will need to deliver solutions directly to people rather than to institutions, which will change how we view—and transport—medical treatments," said Patricia Cole, Managing Director, Same Day &amp; LifeConEx, DHL Global Forwarding.</p>
      <p>"This shift will present a huge challenge to the already complex logistics involved in delivering pharmaceutical solutions, many of which have very strict—and varied—temperature and timing requirements to remain effective. We believe the success of personalised medicine will rely on how well the logistics industry responds to the operational issues involved."</p>
      <p>To help advance the potential of personalized medicine, the report found several crucial solutions including:  1.     Data Analytics for Cold Chain Intelligence. These include artificial intelligence, self-learning systems, data mining and pattern recognition solutions that can learn from a constant stream of information.</p>
      <p>2.     Innovations in Technology. Many carriers are already investing to build a connected fleet. Those that are more forward-looking are also looking to experiment with semi-autonomous and electric vehicles, or with sharing platforms. Other examples include integrating pilot use cases for drones that will enable further exploration of emergency logistics response tactics, particularly for last mile considerations in precision medicine distribution.</p>
      <p>3.     Treatment Based Logistics &amp; Distribution Programmes. Integration of patient and shipment coordination for specific disease treatments, allowing health providers and logistics providers to collaborate to deliver a patient-centric experience.</p>
      <p>4.     Increased Collaboration Between Forwarders and Carriers. Between them, forwarders and airline carriers can deliver end-to-end logistics, and deeper collaboration will help them overcome the challenges in personalised medicine logistics.</p>

      <p>Amsterdam Schiphol Airport has produced a pharma e-book which features interviews with seven experts in the pharma and pharma logistics sectors. Vision Pharma Logistics 2020: Insights and practical advice is published by Schiphol Cargo – the European airport's dedicated cargo department. One of the main conclusions in the book is that pharma logistics professionals who succeed in transforming their supply chain will have a major impact on their organisation's success. "In fact, those who innovate best will position themselves to transform logistics from a cost centre to a true source of competitive advantage." Those interviewed were Rinus Govers, supply chain manager at uniQure; Judith Schut, supply chain manager EMEA at Konica Minolta Medical; René Tjong Tjin Tai, chief executive at Dyzle; Nina Heinz, global head of network &amp; quality at LifeConEx/DHL Global Forwarding; Ryan Viegas, vp supply chain and procurement at Watson Pharma (Actavis); Renate de Walle, director product market group pharmaceutical logistics, Air France, KLM &amp; Martinair; and Antoinette van Kempen, lead auditor at SGS Netherlands. Said an airport spokesman: "Recognising the fast-changing conditions and regulations affecting pharmaceutical manufacturers when shipping their product globally, the eBook sets out to open pharma logistics managers' eyes to the opportunities, warn them about the potential pitfalls of international transportation, and provide expert advice on engineering their supply chains up to 2020." Schiphol, an important European gateway for pharma traffic, launched its Pharma and Life science Logistics Steering Group in 2012, which brought representatives of pharma manufacturers together with its own logistics community, government and regulatory bodies for the sharing of problems and solutions. Schiphol Cargo's business development director, and pharma logistics expert, Bart Pouwels, said: "Today's pharma logistics professionals face a market in the midst of major change and innovation. "Pharma supply chains have grown highly complex due to multiple factors, including market expansion on both the supply and demand sides, and more stringent product quality requirements."</p>

      <p>The air cargo community should drive its own standard for perishables logistics, without waiting for other groups and agencies to establish them, according to Stavros Evangelakakis, Cool Chain Association (CCA) chairman. A lack of accountability is contributing to the 1.3bn tonnes of food being wasted along the supply chain every year, equating to one third of all food produced, delegates heard at the CCA's "World Without Food Waste – what can air cargo deliver?" Conference in Luxembourg. Collaboration, transparency, and data sharing, as well as training for perishables growers and better facilities are needed to inject quality into a fragmented and disconnected supply chain, speakers explained at the two-day event, which brought together cool chain industry leaders from around the globe. "We should aim for quality, we should not wait for other agencies to come up with standards, we should look internally and act now," said Evangelakakis, who is also the global product manager healthcare &amp; perishable at Cargolux, the European freighter operator. He added: "A standard in perishables should be something akin to the standards in pharmaceuticals, and over the next two years as chairman I am going to push for that. Are you ready for collaboration?" The information needed for the supply chain to improve is already there, said keynote speaker Philippe Schuler, food waste prevention consultant – CCA researcher in perishable cool chains. CCA commissioned Schuler to undertake a "farm to fork" study of papayas from Brazil to Europe, looking into the waste in perishable logistics. "The information needs to be made accessible," said Schuler, adding: "When we all start to have access to the data, we can start to solve the problems." Cool chain decision makers from across the worldwide supply chain were also told that the industry was stuck in a "multi-stakeholder model," with no shared communication. "Instead of pointing at each other, we should collaborate," said Frank Van Gelder, Founder, Mediconed Consultancy, adding: "There is a way out, and it is not that far away – let's make quality visible through data." Jeremy Knops, director of operations at The Europe-Africa-Caribbean-Pacific Liaison Committee (COLEACP), said the task sometimes felt huge, but collaboration could drive change. Said Knops: "Supply chain is only part of the issue when it comes to food waste. By showing more producers practical examples, working with leaders, for example, from the transport industry, we can make a very positive impact. "The key word is to look for partnerships, this has to be a joint effort, not only because of the waste, but because of the potential for agriculture to go one way or another." The conference included discussions on shipper's expectations, disruptive food supply changes, fresh food from Asia and berries from the Americas, Africa, and various parts of Europe, as well as a visit to fruit and vegetable importer and distributer Grosbusch. The family-run company has recently launched a scheme called Grosbusch Kids, giving schoolchildren an opportunity to visit their 18,000 sq m warehouse and learn about fresh fruit and vegetables. "We believe in the basics of our business, of course, but there is more than that," said chief executive René Grosbusch, adding: "Our growers aren't able to educate the children, and the supermarkets can't, so we do. We can be part of the change. "In this business, if the right people come together I believe we can make a change." Schuler's research, which is called "Papayas – studying waste in perishable logistics", is available to CAA members.

      <p>Rio de Janeiro – Galeão International Airport has become the first such facility in the Americas region to earn IATA's CEIV-Pharma Certification this week. The effort is part of a US$10 million bid to attract a larger share of one of airfreight's most lucrative types of cargo.</p>
      <p>In addition to extensive training, audits and assessments, followed by improvements to the airport's pharmaceutical handling infrastructure and processes, RIOgaleão recently opened its "TECA Pharma 2" facility, which tripled the airport's cold-storage capacity to 17,000 square meters and added 1,400 pallet positions. The facility features an automated cargo storage system and two temperature-controlled environments (one for 2° to 8°C and one for 16° to 22° C), as well as anterooms and docks that are also climate-controlled.</p>
      <p>Approximately 25 percent of RIOgaleão's cargo revenues are related to temperature-controlled pharma freight. The airport is a hub for the Brazilian government's vaccination campaigns that target remote areas, making RIOgaleão a critical node for both commerce and social services.</p>
      <p>"Air transport, nowadays, requires special capabilities for the handling of pharmaceuticals," explained Carlos Ebner, IATA's director for Brazil. "CEIV-Pharma is a program that seeks to implement international standards of supply chain management, addressing chain challenges, including the latest achievements in the transportation of pharmaceuticals."</p>
      <p>RIOgaleão Cargo's terminal – owned by a consortium made up of Brazilian heavyweight Odebrecht TransPort, Singapore's Changi, and Infraero, a Brazilian government aviation company – is situated 17 kilometers from the Port of Rio de Janeiro. The airport has a 4,000-meter-long runway, the longest in Brazil. The freight side of the airport has nine parking positions allotted to freighters, which can operate 24 hours per day, without restrictions on capacity or landing times.</p>

      <p>IAG Cargo has received GDP (Good Distribution Practice) certification for pharmaceutical transport. The carrier, bringing together the cargo divisions of British Airways and Iberia, says that it is the first airline to be awarded GDP certification by a national government health agency in meeting the premier standard for pharma transport. IAG Cargo received the award following an inspection by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The carrier has been granted Wholesale Distribution Authorisation (WDA) for medicines intended for both human and veterinary use. Alan Dorling, global head of pharmaceuticals &amp; life sciences at IAG Cargo, commented: "The authorisation is testament to the significant investments we have made in our dedicated people and our temperature controlled infrastructure facilities and capabilities, in addition to continuous product development and training to improve our customer experience. "It is welcome third party recognition that IAG Cargo has become the diamond standard for the transportation of medicines worldwide and underscores our global leadership in this fast-growing market." IAG Cargo has made significant investment in its Constant Climate product for specialist service for time-and-temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals, and is now available in more than 100 stations worldwide. Loranne Vella Zahra, global quality assurance manager at IAG Cargo, said: "GDP is a complex area that requires all areas of our supply chain to adhere to the highest standards. Our network ensures that only authorised pharmaceutical products are distributed safely, and their strength, stability, purity, potency and integrity are maintained throughout. "Achieving full GDP status and being granted a WDA is testament to the strong quality system we have in place and the investment we have put in people, equipment, facilities and processes." To ensure the integrity of shipments, accredited GDP/WDA shippers  are likely to select those carriers that have a GDP/WDA licence.

      <p>Freight forwarder Panalpina has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) as it looks to play a role in deploying the technology in logistics. BiTA is a forum of leading tech and transportation companies for the development and implementation of blockchain standards. Members aim to educate the market on blockchain applications and encourage their use through implementation. Blockchain creates a digital record of every transaction made in a decentralised and secure way using cryptography. BiTA standards will address how the technology will impact contracts, freight payments, asset maintenance and ownership history, chain of custody of freight, and other issues facing the industry. Panaplina said that blockchain use in freight forwarding and logistics is still in the early adoption phase, but it is already being approached by vendors, partners and customers about it. Panalpina chief information officer Ralf Morawietz said: "It is likely that many blockchain clusters will emerge, for example centered around ports and customs authorities, carrier groupings, as well as third-party logistics providers and regional logistics networks. "When it comes to using blockchain applications and managing and interacting with all these different clusters, we have chosen a twofold approach that will be coordinated by a new digital innovation unit." Luca Graf, Panalpina's head of digital innovation, added: "On the one hand, we will look at ways to integrate blockchain technology in complex core systems in the long-run. "Here the focus is clearly on reliability, standardisation and partnerships with bigger, established companies. We will also take part in the wider industry discussion in this context. "On the other hand, we will run pilots and trials using blockchain, likely together with start-ups. The focus here lies on exploration and specific market and customer needs." Panalpina said it sees many advantages of blockchain technology for freight forwarding and logistics operations, for instance better tracking of orders and assets. "Because of the decentralised nature of a blockchain, no single entity is in control of the tracking process, which will increase transparency in the supply chain and ultimately improve consumer trust," the forwarder said. "In the area of perishables, for example, blockchain technology can be used to reliably track products from farms to grocery stores, which allows for very precise and quick reports or recalls." Other benefits range from better scalability of operations to optimised capacity monitoring and pricing, fewer errors in payment processing and auditing, improved compliance, easier identification of attempted fraud, theft prevention, ease of building trust and gaining real-time feedback from customers.

      <p>The Istanbul hub of Turkish Airlines has gained the International Air Transport Association's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) certificate for the airline itself and its cargo operations.</p>
      <p>Turkish Airlines says CEIV crowns its "success in all processes of the air transportation of healthcare products during the cargo operations it carries out under the Turkish Cargo brand".</p>
      <p>The carrier says the amount of pharma and similar products are growing every year and it is not only trying to increase its market share, but is also aware of the importance of human health, considers the producers' concerns, and adopts this approach in all processes of shipments.</p>
      <p>Cargo handled includes pharmaceuticals, vaccines, biotechnological products, diagnostic samples, precision healthcare devices, organs, tissues and others.</p>
      <p>At Istanbul Ataturk, Turkish Cargo has a 3,000 square metre special storage areas covering four different temperature ranges (from -20 °C to +25 °C) in an indoor area of 43,000 square metre area, across a total area of 71,000 square metres.</p>
      <p>The healthcare products are stored in a dedicated 1,030 square metre space and all storing and handling processes are carried out as specified in the relevant regulations. Temperatures are monitored with the telemetry system, and all cargo movements are tracked with COMIS, Turkish Cargo's IT software in real time.</p>
      <p>The carrier says for special cargo operations, a dedicated team ensures smooth continuation of the process. The temperature and time-critical consignments are the last cargoes prepared for loading and the first ones loaded into the aircraft in order to minimise their exposure to outer environment.</p>
      <p>With its thermal blanket and active container services, Turkish Cargo says it aims to minimise the risk to highly sensitive healthcare products.</p>
      <p>Turkish Cargo explains it is also planning to commission the 'Thermal Dolly' service and using it for the temperature and time-critical consignments soon.</p>

      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has transported over 25 tonnes of vaccines — some 1.8m doses — from Milan to Bello Horizonte airport in Brazil, the largest vaccine shipment by the Middle East carrier on a single flight. Given the extreme sensitivity of the vaccines to temperature fluctuations, the entire shipment on board the Boeing 777 freighter had to be transported in specialised containers to maintain a constant temperature of 5 degrees Celsius. A total of 36 Envirotainer containers — 35 RAP e2 and one RKNe1 — were loaded on the freighter at Milan, one of the designated airports in Emirates SkyCargo's pharma corridor programme. On arrival at Bello Horizonte, it was has first time the hub had received such a large shipment of vaccines, the pharma products were removed from the containers and transported to temperature controlled storage areas at the airport. Hiran Perera, Emirates senior vice president, cargo planning and freighters, said: "Emirates SkyCargo is a global leader in the air transport of temperature sensitive pharmaceuticals and our commitment to transport lifesaving medications securely is backed by our infrastructure including modern aircraft as well as our GDP compliant processes and our trained staff. "We planned every detail of this charter very carefully with our partners from mid-July to ensure that the vaccines would be delivered carefully to Belo Horizonte airport." Peter Robbe, Belo Horizonte airport cargo manager, said: "Negotiations for the arrival of this shipment included the visit of technical professionals who checked the storage conditions of our chambers considered to be the latest generation. "To take advantage of the potential of the cargo logistics area of the Airport, Bello Horizonte has invested in a new configuration of the cargo terminal and has installed two new refrigerated chambers to triple cool chain storage capacity to 3,350 cu m." On average, Emirates SkyCargo transports about 80,000 pharma shipments every year, varying in size from small clinical trial shipments to pharma charters on freighter aircraft, across its network of over 160 destinations.  Emirates Pharma is the carrier's range of temperature controlled transport services for pharma products. Emirates SkyCargo has invested in developing specialised equipment including the Emirates Pharma Cool Dollies and the White Cover thermal blankets, developed in collaboration with DuPont, for the protection of pharma cargo. As part of a growing awareness of airfreight's importance in emergency medicine supply chains, IAG Cargo earlier this week reported that it had transported 5.3 tonnes of diphtheria vaccine from India to Caracas in Venezuela.  Read more freighter operator and Pharma Logistics news Sign up to receive Air Cargo News direct to your inbox for free </p>

      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has launched White Cover Advanced, a next-generation version of its protection product for valuable temperature-sensitive cargo, including pharmaceuticals. </p>
      <p>Weighing no more than 3kg, the special sheet completely encloses the shipment and allows for cooling during transportation and cold storage. Application takes two people no more than eight minutes to wrap a pallet, said the Dubai-based operator of passenger and freighter aircraft.</p>
      <p>White Cover Advanced uses DuPont's patented Tyvek material made of high density polyethylene to form a tough protective barrier against varying external temperatures and direct sunlight.</p>
      <p>The material is water resistant to prevent moisture damage while breathable, thereby reducing condensation and dryness. It is 100% recyclable.</p>
      <p>While the White Cover is used in the Middle East carrier's cool chain solutions for perishables, such as vegetables and fresh fruits, the advanced offers additional protection for packaged pharmaceutical shipments in Controlled Room Temperature (CRT) range and in insulated packaging.</p>
      <p>Henrik Ambak, senior vice president of Emirates' cargo operations worldwide, said: "The pharmaceutical industry moves products worth over $1trn annually. Temperature changes during transportation can pose a serious threat to the integrity of these sensitive products. </p>
      <p>"They must be kept within different CRT bands in accordance with the revised European Union's Good Distribution Practice. The White Cover Advanced, with its silver-coating technology, provides a reliable and affordable means of protecting these products from temperature spikes during air transportation."</p>
      <p>The carrier's range of advanced protective techniques and solutions in transporting perishable products include: Cool Chain Premium, Cool Chain Advanced and Cool Chain Standard, each of which is designed to meet specific requirements of customers. </p>

      <p>A further 18 students have graduated from the IAG Cargo/Exelsius Good Distribution Practice (GDP) Academy — the fifth such international training course — this time held in London.  Attended by students from Singapore, India and the UK, the course was of particular benefit to forwarders and ground handlers who are either in the process of obtaining local GDP certification or applying for a Wholesale Distribution Authorisation (WDA) approval from the UK's Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency. Aimed at improving industry compliance to GDP standards for healthcare and life science products, the two-day course offered a combination of both interactive classroom learning and an airport airside visit to the IAG Cargo Constant Climate Centre. Students came from forwarders, airlines and ground handling companies, with successful participants being awarded a certificate of achievement following a comprehensive written examination. The certification is valid for two years. Tony Wright, chief executive of Exelsius, commented: "The course programme is designed to provide students with an understanding of the compliance needs of GDP from a truly end–to-end perspective and uses a number of interactive teaching methods." One participant was James Wells, UK International Freight Manager at Aramex UK: "An excellent and thoroughly enjoyable course that I would recommend to anyone involved in the transportation of time and temperature sensitive life science products." Gastion Mesias, manager of Pinnacle International Freight, said: "Quality content, excellently delivered." Both IAG Cargo and Exelsius have already announced dates for three further GDP Academy training courses this year in Dublin, Atlanta and a key city in the Asia Pacific Region.  Alan Dorling, global head of pharmaceutical and life sciences at IAG Cargo, said: "The continued call for this type of GDP training is clearly demonstrated by the demand for places, with the course being sold out very quickly. "I am delighted that all delegates found the unique course enhanced their understanding of GDP and the standards required throughout the end-to-end supply chain and in order to achieve certification."</p>

      <p>As part of American's commitment to support the expansion of its healthcare and pharmaceutical services, American Airlines Cargo has announced the opening of a new Controlled Room Temperature (CRT) facility at its London Heathrow (LHR) cargo center. The new room is 1,700 square feet (160 square meters) and can accommodate up to 16 times more standard euro skid pallets at one time than the previous room. Thus it is providing airline customers with greater capacity when it comes to moving temperature-sensitive healthcare freight to and from LHR.</p>
      <p>Both inbound and outbound logistics companies supporting American's ExpediteTC service will utilize the new CRT room. It is a fully monitored and alarmed facility, where the standard operating temperature will be set to maintain passive products at +59°F to +77°F (+15°C to +25°C). Euro Scan software is used to monitor precise temperatures within the facility, which will provide real-time information to the American operations team, and will be used for reporting purposes.</p>
      <p>"This is a tremendous service enhancement for our European customers," says Andy Cornwell, regional sales manager for northern Europe. "This new, far larger facility, can meet their needs even more effectively now and in the future. And this will be further improved when our COL +2°C to +8°C (+35°F to +46°F) storage for pharma products comes on stream later this summer."</p>
      <p>The newly enlarged CRT room will be of significant value to customers moving specialist pharma traffic between Europe and the US. As the second largest carrier from LHR across the Atlantic, American offers up to 20 daily departures to the United States, including two daily flights between LHR and Philadelphia (PHL), home to American's industry leading 25,000 square-foot pharmaceutical facility.</p>

      <p>Panalpina is launching its new customer portal at Transport Logistic 2019 in Munich on 3 June. It offers collaborative shipment management, fully automated instant quotation and lane risk assessment, features that make the portal unique in the industry, says the forwarder, which was recently acquired by Danish-based DSV. Customers will have the opportunity to test the customer portal in Munich before it is made available later this year.</p>
      <p>"The customer portal enables collaborative shipment management that can be adapted to a company's structure for ultimate customer centricity. This collaborative feature is an industry first. Customers and their external partners can work in remote teams on the platform and bring in their individual expertise at the same time," explains chief commercial officer, Karl Weyeneth. "Our developers have created an intuitive platform in order to make shipping as easy as ordering a pair of shoes online."</p>
      <p>The portal allows Panalpina to provide market-proven instant quotes based on historical selling prices. Algorithms calculate prices in seconds, no matter how complex a shipment is.</p>
      <p>Lane risk assessments based on data covering carrier capabilities, agent certifications, transport modes and warehouse facilities, allowing the forwarder's pharma customers to more effectively qualify suppliers and assess risks during shipment planning and then choose between qualified suppliers.</p>
      <p>The portal allows customers to explore shipment options, as well as control risks and costs even months before a shipment. When the shipment takes place, customers can see all their shipments and relevant data at a glance and in real time on the platform.</p>
      <p>Panalpina has also integrated a new analytics function that allows customers to pull tailored reports directly from the portal.</p>
      <p>Karl Weyeneth added: "We are already working on additional features such as machine learning for quotation, a sophisticated chatbot and big data analysis,"</p>

      <p>IT solutions provider Solace has expanded its partnership with software developer CORE Transport Technologies to support real-time tracking for unit load devices (ULDs) in the air transport industry.</p>
      <p>Building on their 12-year partnership, Solace and CORE's innovative offering will help air carriers effectively implement and manage Internet of Things (IoT) devices for improved monitoring, tracking and routing of shipments.</p>
      <p>"There is no denying the power of IoT in optimising air carriers' shipping processes and operations, and Solace provides the secure and scalable messaging backbone needed for what could become one of the largest IoT implementations in the world," said Ian Craig, managing director at CORE.</p>
      <p>CORE's software, powered by Solace's Virtual Message Router in Microsoft Azure and in part by its award-winning enterprise-grade messaging as a service product Solace Cloud, allows logistics companies to effectively synchronise and exchange critical information in real-time, updating users on the status of their deliveries as well as potential logistical problems.</p>
      <p>Currently, in active roll-out with one of the three largest North American airlines, this technology drives smarter analytics, deeper visualizations and more effective command-and-control functions that improve transparency of air cargo shipments.</p>
      <p>"From severe weather to security issues, there are a number of factors that can impact air cargo deliveries," said Shawn McAllister, CTO at Solace.</p>
      <p>"While IoT is helping air carriers spot these problems, they still need to invest in the right supporting technologies for efficient and secure communications between all the moving parts. Our deepening partnership with CORE helps air carriers make faster, smarter decisions to ultimately deliver better customer experiences."</p>

      <p>All members of the Air Cargo Community Frankfurt are to invest in the optimisation of the ordering process and operation management of pharmaceutical transportation.</p>
      <p>These efforts are based on a combined IT platform, which is set to go live and be rolled-out in the summer this year for automated and electronic process support which allows a complete exchange of information between all members of the supply chain.</p>
      <p>Air Cargo Community Frankfurt, executive at Fraport and vice chairwoman, Anke Giesen says: "With this new concept, we are able to decrease the complexity of ordering processes and increase reliability and speed at the same time by steering the flow of information of all participants digitally."</p>
      <p>An academic analysis by the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences identified potentials for optimisations, which are now being implemented by community members like airlines, freight handling, forwarding businesses, ground handling services as well as IT and scientific Serivce providers.</p>
      <p>Fraport ground handlings services (BVD) and the handling companies Swissport, Celebi, LUG and FCS are currently being audited according to CEIV pharma on behalf of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to confirm the high quality of their pharmaceutical transports.</p>
      <p>"The approval of an independent authority will emphasize our competence as Europe's leading gateway for pharmaceutical products", says Air Cargo Community Frankfurt executive director, Joachim von Winning.</p>
      <p>More than half of the airlines that belong to the community are already certified according to CEIV pharma. This also applies to the Perishable Center and forwarders like Bolloré Logistics.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Air Cargo Community Frankfurt is unifying the registration process for truck drivers at Frankfurt Airport.</p>
      <p>This step aims to reduce the coordination effort between hauliers, forwarders and handling agents by decreasing the duration of stops at the registration within CargoCity.</p>
      <p>Currently there are waiting times to be expected with every loading and unloading of carriers that are commissioned by the air freight forwarders.</p>
      <p>In the near future, all participants in the supply chain want to use unified paper forms so that each one of them can find the relevant information more quickly. The next step will be the implementation of a digital form by using a cargo community system.</p>
      <p>"This will help to improve cooperation between all companies along the supply chain within CargoCity.

      <p>A gap is emerging between those air cargo companies that embrace digital technology and those that are failing to do so. A working group of cargo professionals formed by IT consultant Unisys Corporation found that digital innovations are transforming the way air cargo organisations operate. Unisys Logistics Solutions vice president Christopher Shawdon said: "The most innovative carriers are now data-driven businesses that are responding dynamically to market changes using cloud, sensors, analytics and digital business. "Such organisations are differentiating themselves with speed, control and new value by re-thinking all aspects of their business." Shawdon said that the working group had identified three areas where industry leaders were making inroads: sensors to drive insights, cloud-based systems and electronic supply chains. He said air cargo carriers using sensors embedded throughout the supply chain could feed data into rules-based analytics engines that provide insights and early warning of issues. Those implementing cloud-based technology have the benefit of quick implementation and at a much lower capital cost compared with traditional software and software-as-a-Service models. Finally, those using electronic supply chains are able to maximise the use of available capacity by allowing their systems to interface with those of their customers and partners. Unisys  said: "They are using highly targeted e-business campaigns at a more granular level than can be done through telesales. "And they are using this early and greater visibility of data, combined with mobile technology, to fast-track the flow of goods from acceptance through delivery."</p>

      <p>On May 24, Brussels Airport laid the foundation for its new logistics building located on the west side of Brucargo, the airport's logistics platform.</p>
      <p>The construction of this new building is part of a 100 million-euro investment in the modernisation of Brucargo.</p>
      <p>This new logistics building for cargo handling will have direct access to the tarmac.</p>
      <p>The European airport is developing the building under its own management. The building will be completed in the course of 2020 and can then be taken into use by the tenants Kuehne &amp; Nagel, World Flight Services (WFS) and Expeditors.</p>
      <p>The symbolic 'laying of the first stone' of this new project took place in the presence of Marc Grootjans, Mayor of Machelen, and the CEOs of the three future tenants, Kuehne &amp; Nagel, World Flight Services and Expeditors.</p>
      <p>"With these investments in the further qualitative expansion of Brucargo, the airport is considerably increasing its offer of handling space and particularly that of refrigerated storage. These temperature-controlled rooms are not only of considerable importance for various key sectors in our country including biotech and pharmaceuticals, but also for the import and export of fresh and perishable goods. Two niche markets in which Brussels Airport is specialised and in which it is investing further," says Arnaud Feist, CEO of Brussels Airport Company.</p>
      <p>The construction of this logistics building will also incorporate various sustainability aspects. For example, the office block will get a green roof and solar panels. The buildings will also be economical with water, thanks to the installation of a water infiltration system and rainwater wells for reuse of rainwater. The building will also be equipped with LED lighting and heat pumps.</p>

      <p>DHL Global Forwarding is the latest logistic service provider to offer an online air freight quote and booking platform.</p>
      <p>In response to the growing number of third-party booking websites, the freight forwarding industry – with varying degrees of alacrity – has begun the fightback.</p>
      <p>Kuehne +Nagel launched FreightNet in 2015, while Panalpina announced it was trialling a platform in September.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, K+N launched its platform when Tim Scharwath was its head of air logistics; he is now CEO of DHL Global Forwarding.</p>
      <p>DHL GF's offering, Freightquote, offers door-to-door, airport-to-airport, or a combination. The quote and booking service connects to DHLInteractive, the online customer portal where shipments can be tracked and reports distributed.</p>
      <p>The service is available in 40 countries and covers key tradelanes and point pairs. Designed for "any business", the service gives an immediate quote for general cargo up to 2,000kg, and offers two transit speeds.</p>
      <p>"Customers are provided with a comprehensive quote, based on the pick-up and delivery location, plus their shipment details including weight and dimensions," said DHL. The quoted door-to-door all-in rate can also include import and export customs, as well as cargo insurance.</p>
      <p>"International shipping doesn't need to be a complex task, said Angelos Orfanos, global head of marketing &amp; sales. "From searching for the right supplier through to getting a competitive price, this should be easily available online."</p>
      <p>And it is. Third-party websites are cementing their position and expanding their existing offerings.</p>
      <p>AgreeFreight, which offers container freight rates live, directly linked to a vessel's sailing, is developing its services, planning to take on the Asia-US trade routes with two new platforms: nvo2nvo.com, which will launch in early 2018; and multimodal platform userforwarder, in the summer. It will also launch routemar, another multimodal platform in spring.</p>

      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has introduced pharma corridors to offer additional protection across selected stations in its network for pharmaceutical cargo.</p>
      <p>The airline is working with ground handling partners and other stakeholders across its network in order to ensure that handling operations at these stations are uniform and comply with Emirates SkyCargo's standards as well as either European Union Good Distribution Practices (GDP) or International Air Transport Association (IATA) Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Pharma guidelines.</p>
      <p>The first 12 stations under the programme include Amsterdam, Brussels, Bengaluru, Cairo, Dublin, Dusseldorf, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Milan, Rome, Shanghai and Singapore, with more cities are expected to be added over the course of the year.</p>
      <p>Emirates divisional senior vice president for cargo, Nabil Sultan says: "We realised that it was essential to work with our partners on the ground at the various stations in order to ensure that pharmaceutical cargo travels under the best conditions not only through our state of the art facilities in Dubai and when onboard our modern aircraft, but right from the point the cargo gets dropped off at the origin airport until it is collected at the destination airport."</p>
      <p>The rollout was led by pharma specialists in the Emirates SkyCargo team working in coordination with cargo service delivery teams and ground handlers locally at stations.</p>
      <p>In addition to enhanced staff training, the team undertook a number of engagement and qualification visits in order to prepare for the rollout.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has also invested in developing White Cover thermal blankets in addition to containers such as the Emirates SkyCargo Cool Dolly or the White Container to guarantee that lifesaving medicines are not compromised.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Emirates SkyCargo's operations at its dual cargo hubs of Dubai International Airport, Dubai World Central and the interconnecting trucking operations were certified to EU GDP guidelines by Bureau Veritas.</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo is offering its cargo customers self-service terminals and apps for mobile devices as well as the digital transfer of shipment data and status updates as part of its 'eFreight' drive to speed up acceptance times.</p>
      <p>Before delivery, a PreCheck service verifies the completeness and consistency of the data transferred and helps reduce laborious and time-consuming corrections during cargo acceptance and can help to prevent returns.</p>
      <p>After PreCheck, Lufthansa Cargo customers receive an electronic shipment status update and get the green light in real time to deliver or collect their goods. This could eliminate waiting times for drivers in future, which will allow customers to deploy trucks more efficiently. On arrival, drivers can check in at a self-service terminal and get their ramp assignment.</p>
      <p>In selected locations, parcels are registered via scanner during cargo acceptance. Smartgate, a fully automated volume scanner, automatically determines the size and weight of the parcels, and this information is compared with the data already to hand.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa says the new digital offerings have been "thoroughly put through their paces" during a pilot phase involving about 100 customers. They are now available to customers at the Lufthansa Cargo Centre in Frankfurt and another 15 stations in Germany and abroad, and will be rolled out to further locations in the months ahead.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo vice president global handling management Dr Jan-Wilhelm Breithaupt commented: "We are striding into the digital future of the air cargo industry with our customers – with offerings that are faster, simpler and less error-prone."</p>

      <p>IAG Cargo and Exelsius Consultancy have continued their collaboration to improve standards for handling time- and temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical shipments. The partners' Good Distribution Practice (GDP) Academy held a two-day course in Hyderabad, India, which was attended by 23 people from the shipper, forwarder, airline and ground handling community across India. The course offered a combination of both classroom and physical training in GDP, designed to give a detailed understanding of the compliance needs from an end–to-end perspective.  Practical and interactive group work allowed participants to examine individual aspects of the pharmaceutical supply chain and its risks, supported by a hands-on passive packaging exercise and demonstration. Students also visited the Hyderabad Airport Pharmaceutical Handling Centre, operated by Menzies Air Cargo, and witnessed the acceptance, storage and dispatch of shipments within the temperature-controlled environment. The facility has been specifically designed to meet the needs of local pharma manufacturers such, as Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, which sent four delegates to the workshop. MS Goparkumar of forwarder Expeditors described the event as "an important training course" for freight forwarders, ground handlers and customers.  He continued: "As key players in the supply chain, it is important that they realise each of their responsibilities in Good Distribution Practice." IAG Cargo, the freight arm of British Airways and Iberia, operates its Constant Climate service for pharmaceutical and life science products and has invested heavily in facilities, processes and systems to meet GDP requirements. Tony Wright, chief executive of Exelsius, said: "Although the Good Distribution Practice Guidelines of the Indian Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) are yet to be formally implemented, GDP remains a vital part of the international pharmaceutical supply chain. "I am delighted with the response we have had to this Hyderabad workshop.  Alan Dorling, head of pharmaceuticals and life sciences at IAG Cargo, added: "Hyderabad remains a key hub on our growing network of Constant Climate stations and I am sure that this workshop will encourage participant companies towards formal GDP certification.  We both look forward to supporting them in that important task".

      <p>IAG Cargo, the cargo arm of International Airlines Group, this week concludes its 2019 accelerator program, Hangar 51. For the past 10-weeks, IAG Cargo has been working with its chosen finalist, Spain-based startup Allread MLT to explore the use of machine learning to improve ULD container management.</p>
      <p>With the goal of optimizing stock-taking process for ULDs, Allread intends to train its machine-learning software to recognize ULD containers, and read container numbers. "These past 10 weeks have been jam packed researching the problem statement and understanding how the [ULD management] process works today," said Carly Morris, head of innovation, IAG Cargo. Training the algorithm has entailed extracting data from thousands of ULD images.</p>
      <p>Following the 10-week accelerator, Allread, along with the 12 other finalists selected by IAG companies at a pitch event earlier this fall, will participate in a demo day next month in Barcelona. Until then, Allread will continue working an app that will help IAG Cargo create efficiencies and improve the accuracy of data it collects about its assets.</p>
      <p>In its fourth year, IAG's Hangar 51 accelerator received 474 applications from across fifty different countries in 2019. This year marked IAG Cargo's second year participating in the program, during which it was fielding startups in the "future cargo logistics" category.</p>
      <p>Does your startup have what it takes to compete at the 2020 DEMOvation Challenge? The challenge, which will take place on Feb. 4 at the second-annual Cargo Facts EMEA in Frankfurt, will offer unique demonstrations of innovative aviation and logistics technology in front of an engaged and enthusiastic audience of industry professionals.

      <p>Dallas Fort Worth International Airport or DFW has increased its focus on growing its cargo business that includes enhancing its facilities for high yield cargo commodities. Its position within the fourth largest metropolitan area in the US with a strong diverse economy is actively supporting its vision to become a super hub for cargo in the US.</p>
      <p>Reji John</p>
      <p>There was something unique when Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) signed an agreement with Groupe ADP, the operator of Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG), to develop air cargo strategies that can potentially influence the movement of goods between Texas and Europe, and more specifically between CDG and DFW at the TIACA Air Cargo Forum in Toronto, Canada last month. While the agreement was signed between John Ackerman, DFW's executive vice president of global strategy &amp; development and Marc Houalla, executive director Paris CDG Airport, present on the occasion was DFW board member Madeleine Johnson. "We never had a board member in a cargo conference before. Thisis for the first time," Ackerman told The STAT Trade Times in an interview just a few hours before the official signing ceremony.</p>
      <p>The focus on the cargo division at the board level is a remarkable indication of DFW's desire and vision to find a place among the tier one airports of the US. "We are among the top 10 airports in the US on annual cargo throughput; but if we take the integrators out, we are among the top six," said Ackerman. As for the record, for the year 2017, DFW handled 897,000 tonnes of cargo. And, according to Ackerman, 2018 will set a new record for cargo volume handled.</p>
      <p>Up until a couple of years ago, there was no cargo strategy to talk about at DFW. But ever since it put a cargo strategy in place under the leadership of Ackerman, the numbers began to show strong positive growth trend. Ackerman claims that the growth is close to 20 percent in the last two years.</p>
      <p>"Most US airports don't really focus on cargo; everybody focus on passenger because that gets the headline. But since the roll out of the strategy, we have seen an increase in domestic cargo, international cargo and significant growth in our perishables business. The market has noticed us. People now know about us," Ackerman said.</p>
      <p>There is also a compelling reason why DFW will do well in the years ahead. The airport has been enhancing its cargo handling facilities at the airport to attract high yield pharma and perishables cargo.</p>
      <p>Source : DFW</p>
      <p>DFW invested heavily on a cargo terminal, which is managed by Dnata and was opened earlier this year. One element of the cargo strategy has been the focus on pharmaceuticals and healthcare traffic. The airport has underlined this with a push for IATA CEIV certification process. The 37,000 sq ft cargo terminal houses a cool chain facility of 18,000 sq ft with various temperature zones.</p>
      <p>"Dnata is happy and they are looking for more space; they like to expand. We are also on the path to achieve IATA CEIV certification. We will be the second CEIV-certified airport in North America by the end of this year or early next year. We co-invested in that programme; we want to make sure that they (other stakeholders in the air cargo community at DFW) knew that we were serious about it," Ackerman reasoned.</p>
      <p>As part of building the pharma traffic to DFW from Asia to North America and Latin America, Ackerman has been making regular visits to India, a major exporter of pharmaceutical products in the world, and talking to airport operators and pharma shippers. "We have been to Hyderabad three times this year and have a close working relationship with the Hyderabad Airport, which gathered Indian pharma manufactures and shippers as part of developing a pharma trade lane between DFW and Hyderabad," he said.</p>
      <p>Talking about capacity at the airport Ackerman said there are no constraints on capacity. But the capacity is limited when it comes to cargo handling infrastructure. "Our buildings are full. The limitation is on the side of handling and buildings. The business is growing rapidly, and there is lack of suitable space to handle cargo," he said. According to him there is a cargo development plan on the physical side which will be announced soon. "We are deep in the planning and hope to announce later this year or early next year. The project is expected to be completed within 18 months of its launch," he added.</p>
      <p>Ackerman credits his board for the immense support. "Our board chairman is enthusiastic about cargo, We did an economic impact study a few years back on what the airport did for the region. We found that that the airport delivered about $37billion in economic impact; of which over 55 percent was cargo related. Nobody knew about it. That really got the attention of the board because, the board wanted to ensure that we are supporting the community and the local government, that helped us to get the attention of the board," he said.</p>
      <p>When the cargo strategy was deployed Ackerman and his team told the board that the aim is to join the tier one airports in the US — New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago. Ackerman is fully aware of both the headwinds and tailwinds on the way to the top. But for the moment, his strategic plan for the cargo division of DFW calls for it to be the number one connecting point between Asia and Latin America.</p>
      <p>"We want to be the number one North American gateway for Asia and Latin America, the two fastest growing regions of the world," he said.</p>

      <p>Logistics software firm WiseTech Global has acquired Xware, a messaging integration provider in Sweden.</p>
      <p>Xware's interoperable messaging product, xTrade, is designed to link organisations to their suppliers and partners, allowing them to share information securely.</p>
      <p>Its products are also utilised in the integration of complex applications in specialised sectors such as defence. Xware customers include Swedish Armed Forces, Greencarrier Freight Services, and other organisations across sectors including logistics, IT, and healthcare.</p>
      <p>WiseTech Global founder and chief executive Richard White said: "We are acquiring Xware to enhance our messaging gateway and ensure we have greater control over the future development, quality and scalability of this key messaging technology."</p>
      <p>White said that the acquisition of Xware is part of a "digital straight-through processing strategy" to accelerate adoption, reduce risks and costs and encourage wider digitisation within the logistics industry.</p>
      <p>He continued: "Given our powerful global development capabilities and worldwide reach, we will together further expand the speed and ease with which organisations can interconnect their myriad information systems with our CargoWise One global logistics execution platform.</p>
      <p>"Xware will also play a part in our CargoWise Nexus platform, currently in development, designed to enable our customers to rapidly, reliably and securely connect digitally with their own customers and trading partners."</p>
      <p>Xware managing director Jonas Ericsson said: "Joining the WiseTech Global group brings Xware to a new phase with extensive new technical and commercial opportunities, such as access to the global market, and their very advanced and innovative development resources.</p>
      <p>"While we remain committed to delivering the best messaging integration solutions to our customers across Sweden and their ongoing support, we will now be able to help more organisations who operate outside the Nordics."</p>
      <p>Xware will remain under the leadership of Jonas Ericsson, and founder Anders Lyckosköld.</p>
      <p>This transaction follows WiseTech's other recent logistics solutions acquisitions in Europe, Asia and the Americas, and is in line with its strategy of accelerating long-term organic growth.</p>

      <p>The air cargo industry needs to make three fundamental changes to modernise cargo management while increasing security of data and shipments, says Niranjan Navaratnarajah, cargo industry director for Unisys Asia Pacific.</p>
      <p>He will be presenting his case as a member of the panel in the Cargo Transformation Track at the IATA World Cargo Symposium in Singapore on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The three essential changes needed are: 1) Use centralised data sets based on the e-AWB 2) Capture real time data using mobile devices and Internet of Things technology 3) Use artificial intelligence and predictive analytics for improved visibility, efficiency and security.</p>
      <p>Adopting these practices will help securely modernise today's mostly manual and fragmented cargo distribution processes by moving away from traditional phone and paper procedures, Navaratnarajah says.</p>
      <p>"The cargo industry must modernise to reduce shipment idle time to improve the customer experience, optimise asset utilisation, improve security and reduce unnecessary storage costs.</p>
      <p>"To do this, the entire cargo industry should adopt centralised datasets, that are updated in real-time using mobile devices, automation and Internet of Things (IoT) to hasten processes and allow buyers and sellers to access up to date and accurate information. This 'connected cargo supply chain' offers customers greater visibility, certainty and satisfaction."</p>
      <p>He explains that a single real-time data platform will reduce the possibility of out-of-date data, cut inaccuracies and opportunities for fraud and enable the end-to-end tracking which customers have come to expect.</p>
      <p>With IATA's January 2019 figures showing a 60.8% penetration of e-AWB in air cargo globally, the industry is well poised to move to e-AWB based centralised datasets in the next 12-18 months. He expects Asia to lead the way as eight of the top 10 countries of origin for e-AWBs and five of the six top airports of origin are in the region.</p>
      <p>Unisys, a global information technology company, estimates that, on average, cargo is in the air only 15% of the total delivery time. The industry should aim to cut idle time to around 50 percent.</p>
      <p>It says that in a secure connected cargo supply chain, information flows automatically and mobile devices, wearables, sensors and drones enable staff to process shipments on the spot updating data in real-time. Weigh bridges automatically exchange data with systems preventing data errors and fraud and IoT enabled sensors on shipments proactively alert cargo systems and staff if a shipment has been left behind, in the wrong location, or is distressed.</p>
      <p>Some players are already doing this, but an industry-wide approach is needed to transform the whole supply chain, states Navaratnarajah.</p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence powered by predictive analytics can help freight forwarders to gather and analyse data in real-time and can also generate data to enable airlines to better plan their routes, avoid bad weather and validate the security of shipments. Importantly for the customer experience, this real-time visibility into shipments helps locate misplaced items.</p>
      <p>Moving to a digital data-based cargo supply chain also enables the integration of advanced security information and event management (SIEM) tools, such as Unisys' own Stealth platform with automated dynamic isolation, to protect customer information and shipment data from being accessed or modified by unauthorised parties, preventing data theft and cargo fraud.</p>
      <p>Unisys has also developed Digistics™, a holistic and integrated modular air cargo software logistics solution that allows carriers to streamline freight management and improve their operational efficiencies.</p>

      <p>UPS made several major investments to its global healthcare-related operations and infrastructure, including upgrades to its healthcare-dedicated warehouse and distribution network in the United States and attainment of the EU Good Distribution Practice (GDP) certification for its healthcare-related ops in France and Germany. These enhancements are intended to support direct-to-customer shipping, storage, distribution and temperature controls of critical goods as part of UPS' strategic growth plan aimed at better supporting the unique, priority-handling requirements for healthcare and life science shipments.</p>
      <p>UPS recently added 1.3 million square feet of total distribution space in key U.S. markets. Some of the largest upgrades making up this expansion include a new 450,000 square-foot facility near UPS' healthcare campus and air hub in Louisville (SDF), as well as a new 315,000 square foot center near UPS' local transportation hub in Harrisburg, Pa. The new Harrisburg facility is also strategically located near the integrator's healthcare ops center in Swedesboro, N.J., that offers medical device services, such as autoclave capabilities, decontamination and replenishment of surgical kits and instrument inspection.</p>
      <p>Beyond expansion, upgrades to the facilities include new climate controls and validated coolers and freezers for products requiring strict temperature environments. Security on the healthcare facility premises is supported with special-access cages and vaults to protect high-value specialty pharmaceuticals. The enhancements at these facilities maintain applicable government accreditations and meet international guidelines, including Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), Certified Dangerous Goods Professional (cGDP) and Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA) regulatory mandates, according to UPS.</p>
      <p>"By increasing warehouse and distribution space and optimizing multi-client facilities, our customers have greater opportunity to reduce supply chain costs and get their shipments to the right places globally at the right time and in full regulatory compliance," said Darren Cockrel, UPS president of global logistics.</p>
      <p>By 2020, UPS aims to increase its total U.S. healthcare warehouse and distribution space to 4 million square feet. UPS said its next move will be to expand healthcare warehouse space across other key U.S. pharma markets, which include: Atlanta, Ga; Columbus, Ohio; Reno, Nev.; and Tracy, Calif.</p>
      <p>Across the Atlantic, UPS has also bolstered its healthcare-related operations by attaining the EU Good Distribution Practice (GDP) certification for pharmaceutical shipping in France and Germany. This GDP Certification validates UPS' French and German networks as aligning with proper standards for shipping pharmaceuticals, diagnostic products (including reagents) and stable blood products.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the new accreditation, UPS vice president of UPS Supply Chain Solutions healthcare compliance and quality assurance Tom Page said it also supports the company's "long-term strategy, [which] is built around four pillars that will continue to drive UPS's success in handling critical healthcare and life science goods: quality assurance, visibility, control and customer experience."</p>

      <p>Deutsche Post DHL Group (DP-DHLG) is teaming up with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in a global partnership to improve vaccine supply chains. Over the next three years, the Germany-based global logistics giant will provide Gavi-supported countries with efficient supply chain solutions to improve health care delivery. A joint statement by the two partners said: "As immunisation programmes expand to include new, life-saving vaccines and strive to reach more people, often in remote areas, they are increasingly constrained by outdated supply chains. "With vaccine volumes continuing to increase and the persistence of often weak or broken health systems, there is a critical need for improvements in immunisation supply chain infrastructure." This is not Gavi's first such alliance. In October 2016, the Rwandan government launched the world's first national drone delivery service to transport medical supplies to hard-to-reach places. While the service is focused initially on the transfer of blood, a partnership between US-based express firm UPS, Gavi and Californian firm Zipline will help expand it to other types of medicines and vaccines. The drones, designed and operated by Zipline, will make up to 150 on-demand deliveries of blood to 21 transfusing facilities located in the western half of the country. In this new alliance, DP-DHLG and Gavi aim to increase immunisation coverage, reduce vaccine wastage and better ensure vaccine availability and potency and will ultimately help reduce child mortality.  Kenya is one of the first countries to benefit from the new partnership, announcing an initiative with DHL, the logistics unit of DP-DHLG. Together Gavi, DHL and the Kenyan Ministry of Health will test a dedicated transportation management solution for the efficient distribution of vaccines throughout the East African country. Drones were not mentioned in the joint release. Incorporating a control tower called a Transport Support Hub, to better manage and coordinate third-party transport carriers and the use of DHL's own global transportation network, the solution aims to improve the speed and reliability of vaccine deliveries to hospitals, clinics and medical professionals in the country.   Frank Appel, chief executive of Deutsche Post DHL Group, said: "This enhanced relationship will allow Deutsche Post DHL Group to contribute its world class supply chain expertise and network towards making a real difference to vaccine distribution in the developing world – and, with this, to improve lives." Dr Seth Berkley, chief executive of Gavi, said: "Robust vaccine supply chains are a vital part of building strong health systems, so that children, parents, and communities can be reached wherever they live with life-saving vaccines. "DHL's expertise in healthcare delivery and its footprint in sub-Saharan Africa will help the partnership develop and test new innovative solutions aimed at increasing the health impact in Gavi-supported countries." This project aligns directly with Gavi's private sector engagement strategy, which seeks to build a cluster of a private sector partners to address critical bottlenecks to immunisation coverage and equity in Gavi-supported countries.   </p>

      <p>DHL Supply Chain, the contract logistics segment of Deutsche Post DHL Group, has broken ground on the construction of a new distribution centre for its customer Eaton, the global specialist in power management. The new facility at Rheinbach, near Bonn, will consist of a 35,000 square metre, highly automated storage facility. It is expected by DHL to go in operation by beginning of next year. "The construction start for the new warehouse in Rheinbach is another important step in our strategic partnership, in which DHL is building and managing three integrated, high-performance distribution centres for Eaton in Europe," explained Karsten Schwarz, chief executive of Germany &amp; Alps DHL Supply Chain. "This investment reflects the trust and strategic partnership we have with Eaton, who have leveraged our logistics expertise for the past decade." Over the next few years, DHL expects to support Eaton's European electrical business from three distribution centres in Germany, the UK and the Czech Republic. The new site in the UK began operating for Eaton at the beginning of 2018 and a process of modernisation and expansion of the Czech site is currently under way. The new plant in Rheinbach is designed to benefit the company's Western European customers in particular. The "strategically located site" is said by DHL to offers easy connection to all modes of transport and "guarantees efficient supply internationally due to its geographical proximity to the Duisburg/Venlo port of entry". Moreover, DHL added: "The plant in Rheinbach allows fast turnaround times to European core markets with its connection to nearby DHL Freight and DHL Parcel Hubs and is geared to the needs of many industries." The facility will offer complete warehouse consolidation, built into its planning and design. The plant will also be equipped with cutting-edge technology in order to give it a high level of automation. Eaton's own power management technologies will be use throughout the site and buildings, including main LED and emergency lighting, energy storage systems, low and medium voltage distribution.

      <p>BCUBE Air Cargo has achieved the International Air Transport Association's Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Handling (CEIV) certificate.</p>
      <p>The Italian logistics company was awarded the recognition in Rome at a ceremony on Wednesday 22 July. It gained the CEIV certificate for its new cargo facility at Rome Fiumicino Airport, which specialises in pharmaceutical products that need to be temperature controlled.</p>
      <p>BCUBE Air Cargo is the first airport cargo handling company in Southern Europe to receive the certification, which certifies firms operate under the highest standards of management and transport of temperature sensitive pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>The project was implemented in the first half of 2015 for the two subsidiaries of BCUBE Air Cargo operating at Rome Fiumicino and Milan Malpensa Aiurport. The latter will end the IATA validation by 31 July 2015.</p>
      <p>The project also includes the certification, during 2016, of cargo platforms within the airports of Milan Linate Airport and Venice Airport, where the company operates.</p>
      <p>BCUBE Air Cargo general manager, Mauro Grisafi, says: "We are aware that the pharmaceutical market requests quality logistics services in the airport for the highest level management of its products.</p>
      <p>"BCUBE Air Cargo is at the forefront to meet these expectations. Pharmaceutical companies and forwarders, strong in such a Italian airport logistics system can now significantly reduce the time of delivery of the pharmaceutical product destined for other countries in the world knowing that they no longer have to triangulate airports in Northern Europe; this will help to generate benefits for the whole Italian system thus being able to compete well with other countries with tools and services of the highest quality."</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Grisafi, says BCUBE Air Cargo will be the integration gateway between qualified international pharmaceuticals. "It is essential that pharmaceutical products are transported and managed according to the standard rules of the cold chain through a global logistics network that uses high-level procedures in a competitive environment."</p>
      <p>BCUBE Group and BCUB Air Cargo chief executive officer, Enrico Bazzi, says the investment demonstrates the company's commitment in achieving excellence in all areas of logistics.</p>

      <p>The latest batch of trainees from the GDP Training Academy, sponsored by IAG Cargo and Exelsius, have emerged following a two-day International Training Course held earlier this month in London. The program was the fifth training session held so far, involving students from Singapore, India and the U.K.</p>
      <p>Those attending the intensive session included representatives from forwarders, airlines and ground handling companies, seeking to improve industry compliance to GDP standards for temperature-sensitive healthcare and life science products. The course offered a combination of interactive classroom sessions and hands-on instruction during an airside visit to the IAG Cargo Constant Climate Centre.</p>
      <p>The 18 people who successfully completed the training this month were awarded a Certificate of Achievement following a comprehensive written examination. The certification will be valid for two years. Some of the students who are forwarders and ground handlers who are also in the process of obtaining local GDP certification or applying for a WDA approval from the U.K.'s Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency.</p>
      <p>James Wells, an international freight manager for Aramex UK Ltd, who completed the GDP Academy course, called it a "thoroughly enjoyable course that I would recommend to anyone involved in the transportation of time and temperature sensitive life science products."</p>
      <p>Tony Wright, CEO of Exelsius, said the program is designed to provide students with thorough GDP knowledge "from a truly end –to-end perspective and uses a number of interactive teaching methods."</p>
      <p>IAG Cargo and Exelsius are planning at least dates three more GDP Academy training courses this year in Dublin, Atlanta and a location to be named later in the Asia-Pacific Region.</p>

      <p>ULD management firm Jettainer and the University of Cologne are in the process of developing a new tool that will offer live decision making assistance to improve the management of ULD fleets based on analysis of large amounts of data. Jettainer sales director Thorsten Riekert told Air Cargo News that it had been working on the new system for the last two years. Initial tests have already been carried out in co-operation with Alitalia Cargo but the ULD firm is in the process of finalising a new testing phase with larger customers. There was no definite time line for launch, but Riekert said the company was already beginning to highlight the tool to new customers. Riekert explained that the software would remove the need for ULD controllers to do much of the background work they need to do when deciding how to manage ULDs. The system would offer proactive live assistance, for example, offering alternative routes and scheduling scenarios within a few seconds, or give options on the best way to reduce ULD overstocks. The tool will also provide various parameters, such as speed or environmental impact, to allow controllers to adopt settings to meet their own criteria. However, Riekert was keen to point out that the project was not designed to remove control from humans and that the controllers would always make the final decision. "The decision support system allows the controller to focus more on the optimisation of the ULD fleet. "The final decision will be made by the controller but the work in collecting all the information to find the right decision is automated. "The controller can then focus on making the ULD fleet work as optimally as possible and therefore reduce the amount of equipment they need. "This will create cost efficiencies, help reduce the amount of equipment needed and also help reduce CO2 output." The software will come at no extra cost to customers. Jettainer will benefit from offering a new value added software, which will further increase efficiency in ULD fleet usage. In the future, other packages like weather data, holiday periods or even information on events will be incorporated within the system. This will then enable it to take into account any envisaged increase in the need for ULDs in conjunction with a major event. Six research staff at the University of Cologne and eight employees from the company have been working on the Jettainer-funded research project. Once the live test has been concluded, a decision about the next steps will be made at the end of the year.</p>

      <p>In an interesting development, AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) recently concluded a multi-modal shipment trial for DHL Global Forwarding (DGF) to deliver healthcare products between Moscow and Miami using an RKN active cargo container.</p>
      <p>The trial was conducted in accordance to the Good Distribution Practice (GDP) cool chain standards.According to reports, RKN is a certified air cargo ULD container, which ensures the integrity of pharma products by maintaining temperatures in the range of  2 to  8 centigrade.</p>
      <p>It's controlled room temperature ranges between  15 and  25 centigrade. At any chosen set temperature within the operating, it ranges between 0 and  20 centigrade across the entire transportation process.</p>
      <p>During the trial shipment, AirBridgeCargo's pharma logistics practitioners used an ABC pharma active solution with the help of an Envirotainer RKN unit, replacing real vaccines with service water in order to test the delivery process at each step of the transportation.</p>
      <p>It also monitored the condition of the water, which indicated the state of vaccines under similar conditions.</p>
      <p>Along with DHL Global Forwarding Russia, ABC's pharma experts supplied the Envirotainer RKN unit to the customer's warehouse, and accepted the cargo as a fully built-up unit, ready for carriage at its airport warehouse premises.</p>
      <p>It also showcased a new solution in the Russian market for an RKN, which was physically loaded in a pharmaceutical cooler of a production plant without additional cross-dock operations during the main leg delivery to Miami.</p>
      <p>The overall solution provided by the ABC and DGF team covered delivery, leasing and guaranteed customs clearance for the customer, and also ensured a minimum transit time and eliminated the temperature risk.</p>
      <p>"We are proud to get this opportunity to demonstrate the quality of the pharma solutions which we can provide. We have earned the trust of our customer for the organisation of vaccines transportation. With ABC only developing temperature-sensitive solutions for less than a year, it is a huge achievement to be chosen to offer dedicated lift of healthcare products, which is expected to enhance the quality of life for people of the Republic of Nicaragua, since we commenced the delivery of vaccines in 2018," said Fedor Novikov, global director- pharma of AirBridgeCargo Airlines.</p>
      <p>It also demonstrates AirBridgeCargo's commitment to make its ABC pharma product as the best possible solution for customers requiring high quality pharma logistics.</p>
      <p>The airline received the IATA CEIV pharma certification in 2016, and since then it has developed several special benefits for pharma customers, including the use of digital technologies to send automated notifications to all supply chain stakeholders through the Sky Fresh web platform.</p>
      <p>Besides, it supported industry-level initiatives, such as Pharma.Aero to generate a home-grown pool of logistics experts and orchestration of all internal handling procedures.</p>
      <p>In September, AirBridgeCargo enhanced its pharma services further by gaining Envirotainer QEP accreditation at its global hub at Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport and in Dallas.</p>

      <p>Frankfurt-based air cargo ground handler LUG has re-organised its management structure, stating that the changes will provide "a sustainable, future oriented network structure". Patrik Tschirch, LUG managing director and chief executive, now leads the expanded LUG network and is responsible for the stations in Frankfurt/Main, Munich, and Hamburg as well as for "the further development of the network idea". As a result, he has also assumed overall responsibility for sales and all sales-relevant topics at all three locations. Tschirch confirmed that no-one has left the company as a result of the changes, adding that the new management structure comes amid reports that the global cargo ground-handling sector is set for consolidation, requiring a swift response from established players.  Bloomberg news agency suggested in August that investment fund Cerberus is considering a move for ground handler Swissport following on from its takeover of WFS in June. Said Tschirch in a statement: "I am convinced that there is a lot of potential in an even closer cooperation between the three LUG stations. We want to offer airlines a one-stop-service for professional airfreight logistics with three stations in Germany. We have not yet leveraged all synergies and taken advantage of the increasing digitalization of our industry. "The future belongs to network organisations with entrepreneurially independent units that respect the same values, principles, and rules, and operate to equivalent standards.  A selective expansion of services and optimisation of infrastructure will further strengthen this network." The LUG changes also see Nina Strippel, as chief operations officer, head the management of the Frankfurt station effective from the beginning of September. She reports directly to Tschirch, as do Christopher Frank for Munich and Jürgen Vogt for Hamburg. LUG is currently extending its Health Care Center (HCC) in Frankfurt by a further 190 sq m and driving forward the TAPA B certification of the Munich station. Both projects are due to be completed by the end of 2018. Read more ground handler news</p>

      <p>Lufthansa German Airlines and Lufthansa Cargo have joined the AMOS community with a scheduled first Go-Live in autumn 2020, followed by two later cut-overs in 2021. The initiative will see both airlines and their entire fleets adopting AMOS, a maintenance and engineering software.</p>
      <p>The airlines completed an in-depth Definition Phase, including AMOS business process/interface workshops and the specification of comprehensive business requirements. The project's Implementation Phase has now been approved.</p>
      <p>A dedicated team of Lufthansa German Airlines and Lufthansa Cargo aviation experts supported by Swiss-AS consultants and project managers will guide the flag carrier through this next project phase. Both carriers will implement AMOS including AMOSmobile for its Line Maintenance and CAMO Operations, based on best practice processes already implemented within the group.</p>
      <p>From the moment of cut-over, the line maintenance operations will be fully paperless by using AMOSmobile. This will, in part, be realised by interfacing AMOS with Lufthansa's Electronic Techlog Solution ensuring the status of the entire passenger fleet is live and fully accessible throughout AMOS at all times.</p>
      <p>Fabiano Faccoli, COO of Swiss-AS, added, "Swiss Aviation Software provides to its customers deep industry insight and knowledge, valuable project management experience and the necessary skillsets for complex digital transformation projects. Our customers are the key success factor in our agile development approach during and after implementation, since the customers form part of the development process from early requirement specification through testing to final product delivery."</p>
      <p>"AMOS, which is already used as a standard tool by many LH group airlines, will also help us at Lufthansa to make our Technical Fleet Management processes even more transparent and, above all, even more efficient. Among other things, we are relying on the already very broad AMOS know-how of our sister companies. We chose AMOS because of its 30 years of success in the industry, but also because of its continuous product innovations, which help us to establish state-of-the-art processes in Technical Fleet Management at Lufthansa as wel," said Klaus Froese, CEO Lufthansa German Airlines Hub Frankfurt.</p>

      <p>Joint venture partners Virgin Atlantic Cargo and Delta Cargo are introducing a new Pharma Zone at their London Heathrow joint facility. The new Pharma Zone will support the growing volumes of temperature-controlled healthcare and life science products being carried by both airlines. Opening  today [October 2], the Pharma Zone at their Cargo Point facility is a fully segregated area dedicated to handling and storing pharmaceutical shipments within a strictly regulated temperature environment with dedicated active container storage. Darren Sherlock, manager, products &amp; partnerships at Virgin Atlantic Cargo, who has led the Pharma Zone project, said: "The opening of the Pharma Zone is the latest enhancement to the pharma products of both airlines. "This has also recently seen Delta Cargo become the first US global passenger carrier to gain IATA's CEIV Pharma Logistics certification corporately and at its Atlanta operational hub, while Virgin Atlantic Cargo is on track to achieve Wholesale Distribution Authorisation (WDA) certification in the UK by the end of the year to confirm our GDP compliance. "This reflects our joint commitment to delivering the correct level of service required for temperature-controlled pharma products at both origin and destination points across our networks." Shawn Cole, vice president-Delta Cargo, said:"This dedicated Pharma facility at London Heathrow is an important addition to our global pharma network and, most importantly, provides our customers and pharmaceutical manufacturers access to another major international gateway. "Delta Cargo has successfully achieved CEIV certification in Atlanta and for Delta's headquarters. Over the next year we aim to add our other key hubs to the network, starting with New York-JFK and Los Angeles. "This network, combined with the promise of speed, consistency and efficiency in delivering high-value, time-sensitive, temperature-controlled products right across the network really is a first for the Delta Cargo and Virgin Atlantic Cargo joint venture." Incorporated into the new Pharma facility are two walk-in pods capable of maintaining 2-8°C (COL) and 15-25°C (CRT) temperature ranges for loose pharma shipments. High above the floor of the Pharma Zone for added security is a temperature-controlled storage system for 24 pallets, split into 6 separate chambers, each of which can be safely maintained within either a 2-8°C or 15-25°C temperature range. Other special features include a cargo door dedicated to pharma shipments to speed their flow through the warehouse and reduce the time products spend outside of a temperature controlled environment, and 10 charging points for Active cargo containers. Good Distribution Practice (GDP) training has also been delivered to the team of specialists working in the Pharma Zone. Virgin Atlantic Cargo and Delta Cargo now offer around 24% of the total cargo capacity between the UK and the US, the world's biggest trade lane for pharmaceutical products. Dominic Kennedy, managing director of Virgin Atlantic Cargo, said: "Our pharma tonnage grew by 20% in the first half of 2017 and we expect this to increase as we continue to invest in, and develop, facilities like our new Pharma Zone as well as GDP processes and training across our network. "In terms of our Pharma and Life Sciences offering, we believe our size, alongside direct Virgin oversight at every single station, gives us a real advantage in terms of the agility and flexibility we can offer and our growing volumes indicate our customers share this view. "I also wish to acknowledge the strong commitment of dnata, our handling partner at Heathrow, for enabling us to deliver yet another significant benefit for our customers, who remain at the heart of everything we do."</p>

      <p>Other panellists will include Nourddin Odris, head of transport management global supply chain at Roche, Agnes Turek, project manager services at Bayer, and Navid Choudhury, senior manager, supply chain planning at Novo Nordisk.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Cool-chain partners are seeking new ways whereby stakeholder collaboration delivers a cost-effective and high-quality service in a rapidly changing pharma landscape," commented Stavros Evangelakakis, CCA chairman and global product manager at Cargolux. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Evangelakakis continued: "We need new ways of working together to meet the growing demands of our pharma customers and ensure that when it comes to the last mile, we are part of the solution. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"There is a clear need for all stakeholders to investigate ways to collaborate and find solutions to make sure there is a successful end-to-end chain. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Embracing new innovations and technology is at the forefront of the debate to help fix the problem." </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The event at the Marriott Hotel at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, will include a mix of panel discussions, presentations, and debate, as well as roundtable discussions and networking opportunities.</p>
      <p>In June, the CCA named Alha Group pharma and business development manager Nicola Caristo as its new secretary general.</p>
      <p>He took over from Edwin Kalischnig, CCA secretary general for the previous seven years.</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has kicked off the development of the Cool Center at the Frankfurt hub. With the opening of this new cool center, there will be more capacity for temperature-sensitive cargo in Frankfurt imminent.</p>
      <p>Following completion, as of late summer of this year, 8,000 square metres will be available for cool chain cargo. After the extension, the entire infrastructure of the Lufthansa Cargo Cool Center will be further improved. It was opened in December 2011 and currently offers 4,500 square metres in four different temperature-controlled chiller rooms (2 to 8°C, 15 to 25°C, -12 to -20°C and 5 to 15°C) as well as a deep-freeze room and direct access to the apron. As a result, it is currently the largest hub for temperature-sensitive freight in Europe.</p>
      <p>"We've gained a great deal of experience in the worldwide transport of sensitive medications. CEIV certification from IATA has recently highlighted this. The excellent collaboration with numerous shippers from the pharmaceutical and chemical industries has prompted demand for our service to grow consistently. We're delighted to be able to offer our customers even more capacity and flexibility in our Cool Center as early as late summer", said Board Member Operations Sören Stark, in the course of the ground-breaking ceremony.</p>
      <p>In late 2016, the IATA airline association awarded the CEIV seal of approval for pharmaceutical transport to Lufthansa Cargo and the Cool Center.</p>

      <p>ULD management provider and Russian all cargo airline AirBridgeCargo Airlines have extended their partnership for the extensive usage of Transmitting Portable Electronic Devices (TPEDs) for ULDs - pallets and containers.</p>
      <p>The equipment, which is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE v.5.0) tracking and sensing device, will be firmly mounted to ULDs supplied and managed by Unilode and carried in the cargo compartments of AirBridgeCargo's Boeing 747 freighter fleet.</p>
      <p>The monitoring devices will be used to track ULDs, register all environmental parameters, covering such crucial factors as temperature, humidity, illumination and shock actions to guarantee 100 percent transparency of shipment data. In addition, AirBridgeCargo will get accurate information from Unilode about the cargo status and its location, be it in the air or on the ground (warehouse, apron).</p>
      <p>Both companies have reached agreements on the terms of BLE v. 5.0 usage, with the main work to be completed afterwards.</p>
      <p>ABC and Unilode are working on the rollout, making sure all the ULDs are properly equipped with BLE v.5.0, Bluetooth readers are installed at the places of cargo movement (warehouse, ground handling premises), and dedicated IT infrastructure is set to capture signals for real-time cargo monitoring.</p>
      <p>"This is especially important for special cargo - pharmaceutical products, oversize and heavy goods, live animals, etc. With the penetration of digitalization taking place in the air cargo sector, we want to make sure that our customers get the full benefit of it, be it general cargo, abc pharma, abc XL or other specialist dedicated services," stated Sergey Lazarev, general director, AirBridgeCargo Airlines.</p>
      <p>"AirBridgeCargo Airlines is Unilode's loyal customer since 2004 and we are very pleased to work together in our digital transformation programme which will enhance Unilode's ULD management with the most innovative solutions available in the market. The BLE v.5.0 device is the most cost-effective solution for the transmission of shipment parameters with its primary benefits being improved speed and greater range. Thus, it operates faster and over greater distances than previous versions of Bluetooth. Unilode and AirBridgeCargo have been improving the quality of shipment data, which provides timely and detailed information to all stakeholders in the value chain," said Benoit Dumont, Unilode CEO.</p>
      <p>With this in mind, AirBridgeCargo Airlines has upgraded its online track and trace tool, introduced 24/7 Control Tower to monitor status of special cargo shipments, and reinforced its team at all levels.</p>

      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has introduced pharma corridors offering "additional protection" across selected stations in its network for pharmaceutical cargo. A spokesperson for Emirates SkyCargo said that Middle East carrier is working with ground handling partners and other stakeholders at multiple cities across its global network in order to ensure that handling operations for pharmaceuticals at these stations are "uniform and comply with the airline's stringent norms for pharma transport". The Dubai-based freighter and passenger carrier is also ensuring that the stations comply with either European Union (EU) Good Distribution Practices (GDP) or IATA's Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) pharma guidelines. "Emirates SkyCargo will therefore be able to provide a supplementary protection of product integrity during transport of temperature sensitive pharmaceutical cargo through these cities," said the spokesperson. In 2016, Emirates SkyCargo's operations at its dual cargo terminals at Dubai International Airport and Dubai World Central airports, plus the interconnecting trucking operations, were certified as compliant to EU GDP guidelines by standards compliance agency Bureau Veritas in Germany. The introduction of pharma corridors with a focus on non-hub handling activities allows the carrier "to go one step further for the protection for pharma cargo", added the spokesperson. Nabil Sultan, Emirates divisional senior vice president, cargo, said: "As a customer focused organisation, we have been listening to feedback from stakeholders in the global pharmaceutical industry. "We realised that it was essential to work with our partners on the ground at the various stations in order to ensure that pharmaceutical cargo travels under the best conditions not only through our state of the art facilities in Dubai and when onboard our modern aircraft, but right from the point the cargo gets dropped off at the origin airport until it is collected at the destination airport. "We are also actively exploring the roll out of dedicated pharma flights across our network. Emirates SkyCargo constantly strives to offer the best solutions for our customers."

      <p>Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS) has started trial operations at what it describes as the country's first integrated on-airport perishable cargo handling centre, ahead of its commissioning expected by the end of the year. AISATS Coolport, at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru is a 40,000 tonnes a year, 11,000sq m facility to handle temperature-sensitive cargo including pharmaceuticals and perishables. It offers 17 dedicated cold rooms with adjustable temperatures ranging from – 25OC to + 25OC and will house a drug control lab and plant quarantine inspection and certification office.  It will be supplemented by temperature-controlled queue lanes for unitised shipments and cool trollies to ensure the integrity of the cold chain to and from the aircraft. Bengaluru, in Karnataka state – one of India's leading pharmaceutical and produce regions – has seen a steady 15% annual increase in perishable cargo volume. AISATS chief executive Mike Chew, said India "requires upgraded infrastructure to cater to the growing needs of the trade and the air cargo industry. We believe that this dedicated state-of-the-art facility will further boost exports and imports of temperature-sensitive products." It would also bolster the Government of Karnataka's vision of turning the state into a preferred air cargo hub for south India, Chew added. President of airport operations, Hari Marar, added: "As an airport that is strategically positioned at the heart of South India, we have the opportunity to take advantage of this momentum and be the single gateway for cargo traffic and shippers aspiring to reach this fast-growing region." AISATS is a 50:50 joint venture between Air India and Asian gateway services and food solutions provider, SATS. It forms part of the Indian Government's initiative to improve airport ground and cargo handling services. Since starting operations in 2008, AISATS has provided solutions to carriers at Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mangalore and Trivandrum including cargo handling for general, perishable, transshipment, express courier and special cargo.</p>

      <p>The International Air Transport Association's (IATA) Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Pharmaceutical certification is raising the standards in the handling of pharma air cargo. Air Cargo Week spoke to the project's lead, Ronald Schaefer, about his role and how successful the programme has been.</p>
      <p>Justin Burns, ACW: What is your role in the IATA CEIV programme?</p>
      <p>Schaefer: My role is to develop and promote the CEIV Pharma certification programme whose main objective is to improve the industry's overall levels of competency, as well as technical and operational preparedness via industry and regulator backed training and validation.</p>
      <p>However, the programme's vision is more than simply filling current industry gaps or reducing costs. Rather it is to protect the end users of the various pharma goods shipped by air, for whom swift and unaltered accessibility to vaccines and medications could prove to be a matter of life and death.</p>
      <p>Justin Burns, ACW:  Why was the CEIV certification set-up?</p>
      <p>Schaefer: CEIV Pharma was set up as a response to the industry's need for a network of certified pharma trade lanes that meet globally consistent standards and assure the product integrity of the valuable, time and temperature-sensitive pharma products being shipped via air.</p>
      <p>Justin Burns, ACW: Who can qualify for this certificate?</p>
      <p>Schaefer: All industry stakeholders in the pharma air transport value chain can qualify for CEIV Pharma. Airlines, airports, freight forwarders, ground handlers, and trucking companies, as long as you handle pharma being shipped by air and are committed to provide quality services, you can qualify.</p>
      <p>Justin Burns, ACW: What processes do companies have to go through to become certified?</p>
      <p>Schaefer: In order to achieve certification, companies must undergo a rigorous training and assessment programme. The path to CEIV certification begins with an assessment by our indepedent validators of cool chain/pharma processes and facilities against international standards, guidelines and regulations. The training consists of two multiple day courses, which cover a variety of topics regarding temperature controlled cargo operations as well as the audit, quality and risk management of temperature controlled cargo.</p>
      <p>The final stage, the validation phase, ensures all requirements established during the assessment phase are in compliance and all the gaps and recommendations have been implemented.</p>
      <p>Justin Burns, ACW: How many firms are now certified?</p>
      <p>Schaefer: There are 16 companies certified and 65 are estimated to complete assessment by the end of the year, with approximately 15 more expected to meet requirements.</p>
      <p>Justin Burns, ACW: What difference can CEIV certification make to pharma business?</p>
      <p>Schaefer: CEIV Pharma helps firms properly train their personnel, develop adequately equipped facilities, attain compliance with globally recognised standards and benefit from a marketable common audit format that minimises disruption of operations and increases an entity's probabilities to effectively meet the growing number of governmental regulations and pharma company audits.</p>
      <p>CEIV Pharma helps reduce annual product losses (estimated at $12.5 billion worldwide), and mitigates the growing mode shift taking place from air to sea for pharma shipments and the safety benefits that follow from a significant reduction in temperature excursions.</p>
      <p>Justin Burns, ACW: Does IATA think that CEIV will help attract more pharma business to the air cargo industry?</p>
      <p>Schaefer: Yes. Definitely. CEIV Pharma certification was created alongside both industry stakeholders and regulators in order to keep a fine balance between regulations for the public good and ensuring the sector's long-term sustainable growth.</p>
      <p>Justin Burns, ACW: What feedback has been given by pharma shippers about CEIV certified facilities?</p>
      <p>Schaefer: Beginning with our pilot project with SATS in Singapore to the latest certifications completed by BCUBE air cargo and CAL Cargo Airlines, the feedback has been extremely positive.</p>
      <p>Even companies who had already been good distribution practice compliant, mentioned that the programme gave them another push towards improving their standards.</p>
      <p>The most important feedback is that the programme achieves what is designed for, which is to uncover, and eventually solve, industry wide communication gaps through the application of mutual cooperation, honest sharing of data and a strong emphasis on stakeholder teamwork.</p>

      <p>Russian all-cargo carrier AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) has entered into a service level agreement with Sky Fresh to use the Belgian IT firm's online data platform for monitoring time- and temperature-sensitive shipments. The move to digital processes will enable users to complete checklists via an app on their smartphone or tablet, with the resulting data visible on the Sky Fresh platform in real time. ABC said the deal "offers high level of customisation, transparency of operations, traceability, efficiency and the possibility to take corrective and preventive actions, if needed", while also being in line with the airline's environmental agenda as it reduces its reliance on paper-based processes. Fen Lasseel, business development manager at Sky Fresh, said the two companies "want to create a digital mindset in the air freight industry". According to Fedor Novikov, global director, pharma at ABC: "It is not every day we see cutting-edge technologies penetrating [the] air cargo industry, which makes Sky Fresh an attractive industry-and-tech-savvy solution. We foresee it propelling the quality of our abcPharma product, bringing it to the next level by eliminating human mistake factor." ABC's pharma volumes have shown significant growth, up by a whopping 153% year on year for the first 10 months of 2017, the airline said. The Sky Fresh app is available through the App Store of Google Play. In October, ABC announced new freighter flights to Belgium's Liège airport, a move that was likely linked to constraints at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Having since regained its Schiphol slots, ABC is understood to be in talks with Liège regarding a continuing operation there.</p>

      <p>MAB Kargo announced its initiative to obtain the Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) certificate with a signing ceremony with the International Air Transport Association (IATA).</p>
      <p>The IATA CEIV Pharma is a standardized global certification programme that guides companies to comply with existing global pharmaceutical guidelines. At the signing ceremony, Mohd Zulkefly Ujang, chief operation officer signed for MABkargo while Conrad Clifford Asia Pacific regional vice president signed for IATA. The signing was witnessed by Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG) chief executive officer Izham Ismail. The signing makes MABkargo the first airline and cargo terminal operator in Malaysia to embark on this certification process which will take six months to complete.</p>
      <p>Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, acting chief executive officer, MABkargo said, "We see great potential in pursuing the certification. Moving temperature sensitive, high value pharmaceutical cargo can be challenging due to the multiple requirements and processes needed to cater for such shipment.Moving forward, with MABkargo's dedicated cold chain handling services which is MH Centrigrade that is supplemented by a cargo partner, Envirotainer, MABkargo and its partners will go one step further by focusing on high quality service with an exphasis on excellence and safety."</p>
      <p>"The shipping of pharmaceutical products is the fastest growing segment in the air freight industry. Given the sensitive nature of the products, it is necessary to establish global time and temperature standards and best practices to ensure integrity of pharmaceutical products are not compromised when they are shipped by air," said Clifford.</p>

      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo has signed an agreement with DoKaSch Temperature Solutions to offer the Frankfurt-based equipment specialist's Opticooler range of temperature-controlled containers for transporting pharma products. The chief officer cargo of the Middle East Gulf carrier, Ulrich Ogiermann, said: "We understand the intricacies of a seamless cool chain and always aim to provide value to our customers. Through this agreement with DoKaSch, we have now expanded our active container offering for customers, presenting our business partners with more options to transport their pharmaceuticals globally." Andreas Seitz, managing director of DoKaSch, said: "We are convinced that with Qatar Airways Cargo's extensive and rapidly-growing network, and our joint commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, this partnership will provide a great solution for the global Pharma cool chain." DoKaSch Group runs a fleet of Opticoolers RAP (5 pallets) and RKN (1 pallet), that are rentable for shipping temperature-sensitive cargo. The units are equipped with electric, battery-powered cooling compressors and heaters and require no dry ice. The active containers keep the cargo within a temperature range of 2 to 8 degrees celsius or 15 to 25 degrees celsius. The system features a touchscreen interface for dependable temperature setting. Qatar Airways Cargo announced in May this year the launch of its Climate Control Centre, a 2,470 sq m airside transit facility for temperature-sensitive cargo at its Doha hub. The facility features two temperature-controlled zones operating at both 2 to 8 and 15 to 25 degrees celsius with a capacity to hold a total of 156 unit load devices (ULDs) at a time. Segregated sections within the facility enable storage of pharmaceutical products in compliance with Good Distribution Practice (GDP) guidelines.  The significant investments in the cool chain and expansion of its pharma network have seen the cargo carrier's QR Pharma volumes grow by 42% in 2016-17 over 2015-16.  Qatar Airways Cargo's expanding Pharma network spans 73 stations, with the recent addition of Colombo on in May and Dublin in June this year. It pioneered Pharma Express flights from the key pharmaceutical hubs of Basel, Brussels, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, supporting pharmaceutical exports from these destinations.  </p>

      <p>Temperature controlled container firm Peli Bio Thermal will add 12 new service centres to its operations over the coming year as it looks to expand its Crēdo on Demand rental operation. The company recently appointed Dominic Hyde as vice president of Crēdo on Demand to oversee the development, as reported in Air Cargo News. He said that as well as the new service centres, which include the locations Tokyo, Seoul, Mexico City and San Diego, the company will also look to add 50 new drop-off hubs for the return of packaging at destinations with an import/export imbalance. San Diego will hold its official opening in February while the other locations mentioned will all open in the first half of the year. The drop off hubs will be located on, or close to, major international airports. "The new service centres are a significant investment but really they are only the first step in connecting the pharmaceutical production with its markets," Hyde said. "So with 12 centres opening in 2018 that would be a total of 18 at year-end and they've been selected carefully to meet the needs of existing customers and then also to start opening Crēdo on Demand to the larger addressable market. "It is a significant investment, I think we have the right ingredients for success and will get a good return on those investments. "The upside for customers in the industry and what's exciting me most is really the expectation of what we can do about the price/performance mix in the market." Looking further ahead, Hyde said the company was preparing for new product launches. "Peli BioThermal seems to be developing a portfolio of small parcel and pallet shippers, which are both single use and multiple use and now laying the service on top, I think they really have all the bases covered." Hyde said that much of the demand for rental services was down to the fact that shippers do not want to own the asset. He would need to work on developing relationships with other supply chain stakeholders in order to build the rental operation. "Pharmaceutical companies don't want to be the owners and operators of containers and they contract with airlines orders and integrators. "They don't want to invest in those sorts of assets so there is a space to be a service provider in the middle but we can't do it on our own. "So part of my job is to help build at partner network with airlines, freight forwarders and integrators so together we can realise the benefits of the sector for the benefit of pharmaceutical shippers. "I have a lot of contacts in the industry and I hope that will ease the passage but at the end of the day we have to bring forward value propositions not only for the pharmaceutical shippers but also for the partners as well." Hyde said that his immediate priority would be making sure the company, which launched its rental operation two years ago, served the needs of its existing customers before looking to serve the wider market. He added that while the company would be looking to grow it was important that it maintained standards and availability that customers expected. Other challenges he will face in his new role include the evolving regulatory environment for pharma products, which is increasingly focusing on the supply chain. "The regulator's focus has shifted further down into the supply chain of the pharmaceutical industry and is always trying to increase the protection in all areas to ultimately to preserve the efficacy and value from the production to the patient," he said. "At the same time, while the global markets continue to grow there is of course price pressure and it is our challenge to deliver the highest performing systems with regulatory compliance in the most cost effective way possible."

      <p>A little more than a year ago, the FrankfurtAIR@Link (FAIR@Link) cargo community system (CCS) went into operation at Germany's busiest air freight hub. According to Frankfurt airport operator Fraport, since the system was introduced at the gateway in January 2015, the number of users and also the volume of cargo handled via FAIR@Link have grown steadily. During the course of 2015, the platform's list of users were joined by CEVA Logistics, GEODIS, Röhlig, UTi Deutschland, and cargo handler CHI. Meanwhile, the number of shipments registered on FAIR@Link increased by 55% between January 2015 and January 2016, with a total of more than 40,000 air waybills (AWBs) being processed using the system over that period. FAIR@Link, like all CCS, is designed to shipments to be moved through the port/airport more efficiently. Ulrich Wrage, CEO of Dakosy, the company that developed the system, has summarised its benefits: "The handling agents benefit from FAIR@Link both because it reduces paperwork and because it lets them assign personnel to loading and unloading processes more efficiently. Forwarders and their service providers realise major time savings in connection with deliveries and pick-ups as a result of leveraging digital and largely automated processes." Fraport has viewed the introduction of FAIR@Link as representing a major push on the road towards digitising Germany's largest and busiest cargo airport. Dirk Schusdziara, senior vice president cargo at Fraport, explained: "Our customers want reliable, transparent processes, and FAIR@Link serves as the basis for this. It networks the players in the airfreight chain and allows them to digitally exchange information, which in turn improves the physical processes between them – not just within our CargoCities, but also well beyond their perimeters. That is why we actively supported the development of this system from its beginnings. "Looking ahead, we will continue to promote the platform in order to strengthen our leading position in this sector," Schusdziara added.</p>

      <p>Fifteen airlines are to switch to the electronic air waybill (eAWB) from 1 March this year as the preferred method for shipping airfreight, but there remains barriers to adoption notably from forwarders, according to Descartes.</p>
      <p>Air Canada, Air France-KLM, American Airlines, British Airways/Iberia (IAG), Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Etihad Airways, Finnair, Lufthansa Cargo, Qatar Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Swiss and United Airlines are making the switch.</p>
      <p>Descartes vice president of its global logistics network, Scott Sangster says this is a significant milestone in the air cargo industry and "creates a new level of urgency for forwarders to move toward the eAWB".</p>
      <p>He continues: "On the carrier side, the benefits of the eAWB are clear— airlines need the information to populate security filings and to streamline a high volume of air freight shipments. On the forwarder side, the advantages are less defined. Forwarders must have business value to make the transition.</p>
      <p>"Some carriers are meeting the challenge of forwarder eAWB adoption by utilising the stick portion of the "carrot or the stick" motivational practice by charging for paper documentation at the house and master bill level.</p>
      <p>"While this helps push the discussion forward, the overall value to the industry will be reached when additional forwarder objections or barriers to participation are addressed."</p>
      <p>He says one of the major objections to forwarder eAWB participation has been the difficulty to manage and maintain the specific requirements within each trade lane and to determine what shipments are eAWB eligible.</p>
      <p>And in order to mitigate this barrier to entry, he says many airlines are adopting an innovate method to boost forwarder participation called the Single Process approach.</p>
      <p>Sangster adds: "The Single Process approach is a more streamlined method that makes it easier for forwarders to submit digital airway bill information. Simply stated, forwarders provide airway bill details electronically without worrying about destination or transit countries.</p>
      <p>"As a result, forwarders will no longer have to determine whether an airport is eAWB-enabled or if a shipment qualifies for digital submission. Carriers handle the printing of paper air waybills on demand.</p>
      <p>"It is also important to note that although the Single Process approach can minimise eAWB complexity for forwarders, it places carriers at the centre of information management. In order to reduce the workload on a carrier's business, airlines may turn to technology providers that can help streamline and simplify many IT challenges."</p>
      <p>Returning to the forwarder perspective, he says the Single Process approach is beneficial to the air cargo industry but still does not address all forwarder concerns.</p>
      <p>He concludes: "Forwarders increasingly need to meet the expanding carrier electronic communication requirements, increase visibility and improve performance. This latest eAWB programme is yet another indication of the drive towards paperless operations to increase efficiency, reduce costs and improve the end customer experience."</p>

      <p>German cargo airline Lufthansa Cargo continues to invest in technology as it acquires minority shareholding in the Berlin start up cargo.one.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo is thereby making the switch from early adopter to minority investor.</p>
      <p>The startup that was founded a year ago has developed a platform for booking and marketing air cargo capacity. Through its focus on offering dynamic spot rates and enabling their booking, cargo.one is the first platform of its kind.</p>
      <p>"Our customers' overall experience is now strongly improved by being able to more efficiently book air cargo capacity," said Peter Gerber, CEO and chairman of the Executive Board of Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>"The investment in our technology signals to our customers that cargo.one is a strong partner with which to join forces to drive air cargo digitisation. Air cargo capacity worldwide can be made available online through our innovative distribution technology. Accordingly, we want to grow to become a global leader," said Moritz Claussen, cargo.one founder.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo already invested in a technology startup – Fleet Logistics – based in Portland, USA, back in early 2018. Founded in 2014, Fleet Logistics acts as an online marketplace, matching customer demand for cargo services with free capacity provided by logistics companies.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has also been cooperating since February 2018 in the role of anchor partner with technology accelerator Plug and Play based in Sunnyvale, USA. They combine their efforts  within the supply chain and logistics platform, which is focused on supply chain startups, to further develop and quickly implement new digital solutions. The programme provides an opportunity for logistics players to network with and learn from each other, exchange ideas and drive digitisation.</p>
      <p>"The close cooperation between Lufthansa Cargo and technology startups melds comprehensive air cargo experience with a technology-driven, fresh view of global logistics processes," said Boris Hueske, head of Digital Transformation at Lufthansa Cargo.</p>
      <p>"By acquiring a share in cargo.one and Fleet Logistics, Lufthansa Cargo is emphasising its strategic commitment to elevating the air cargo industry to a higher level of digital maturity," said Hueske.</p>

    <title>BRU looks to optimize ground handling with 'BRUCloud' app</title>

    <content>
      <p>Last week, during a panel discussion at Cargo Facts Asia, in Shanghai, speakers were asked to identify the weakest link in the air cargo supply chain, and, to no surprise, fingers were pointed at ground handlers. While no panelist offered a fix-all solution that could remedy the relationship between carriers and handlers, most agreed that airport cargo communities offered the best chances of doing so.</p>
      <p>Air Cargo Belgium, the community present within BRUcargo at Brussels Airport, may be the group to tackle the challenge after announcing the months-long rollout of "BRUCloud," its latest cloud-based slot-booking app, which promises to reduce waiting and idle times at ground handler facilities.</p>
      <p>The BRUCloud app streamlines cargo pickups and deliveries at ground-handling facilities, which BRUcargo said will lead to better capacity utilization and elimination of peak and idle times. Forwarders will soon be able to request delivery slots on an ad-hoc basis or reserve reoccurring time slot from one central platform, which is connected to all of the ground handlers within Air Cargo Belgium. Ground handlers will also have control over the availability of time slots for different cargo types through both the cloud-based app, as well as any applicable internal management systems.</p>
      <p>Like BRUcargo's previous apps, BRUCloud was developed by Nallian, which creates and operates the cloud-based data-sharing platforms that ultimately host cargo communities. While initially, the slot=-booking app will be made available to local stakeholders at Brussels Airport, BRUcargo and Nallian envision the app being seamlessly integrated into other cargo communities around the globe.</p>
      <p>Once launched, BRUCloud will become the fourth app available to the BRUcargo community. Since going live in 2015, the system has already launched a dashboard, which helps stakeholders visualize the quality and progress of pharma shipments; a booking application for pooled equipment, such as BRUcargo's own refrigerated pharma dollies; and a statistical application that gives stakeholders insights into the freight volumes handled at BRUcargo.</p>
      <p>"It is only a couple of months ago that we started to define the scope of our first release. Today, this release has been developed and the first testing sessions have been extremely positive," said Steven Polmans, head of cargo at Brussels Airport.</p>
      <p>"The slot-booking app will open a lot of opportunities for future applications", adds Sara Van Gelder, the cargo development manager responsible for digitalization projects at BRUcargo.</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo has continued to digitise its offering by becoming the latest carrier to sign up to the cargo.one booking platform.</p>
      <p>Starting this week, freight forwarders will be able to instantly book cargo space on Etihad's aircraft through the digital platform.</p>
      <p>Etihad Aviation Group's managing director cargo and logistics services Abdulla Mohamed Shadid told Air Cargo News this is the latest step in the cargo carrier's digital development, which it started just over one year ago when it went live with the IBS iCargo system.</p>
      <p>"As we have navigated the last 12 months, the journey has been quite remarkable and our customers' keenness to move to online booking has been beyond our expectations," he said.</p>
      <p>"Today, about 38% of bookings are coming through our online portal and that number continues to increase – it shows the cargo industry's hunger and drive to adopt digital technologies, which I think has been historically lagging in the sector."</p>
      <p>Shadid added that putting capacity on cargo.one would provide existing customers with more booking options but could also help win new customers in markets it hasn't tapped into in the past.</p>
      <p>Moritz Claussen, managing director of cargo.one, added that implementation work had started in September and had taken around six weeks to complete, helped by the fact that cargo.one has worked with other airlines on the IBS iCargo system.</p>
      <p>Claussen added that Etihad Cargo is not the first Middle East-based carrier to put its capacity on cargo.one, but the addition will help expand the number of origins and destinations that forwarders using the platform are able to access because of the number of connection the airline offers from Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>"In total we are adding 30-35 additional destinations around the world with Etihad Cargo joining," said Claussen.</p>
      <p>"So, we are gaining quite a lot out of the addition of Etihad Cargo's network and we will be able to offer a lot more to forwarders using cargo.one."</p>
      <p>In total, cargo.one now has eight airlines signed up to the portal – it also recently announced Nippon Cargo Airlines – as well as 320 freight forwarder companies, although they often have many branch offices making bookings.</p>
      <p>He added that the number of users on cargo.one has been growing on average by 20% each month and volumes are up significantly, despite the market downturn.</p>
      <p>Looking to why digital services are quickly growing, Shadid said it is part of the industry's drive to improve the ease of doing business.</p>
      <p>"Historically the industry relied on email exchanges and telephone calls and that provided very little visibility for a forwarder into available capacity and available pricing in the marketplace.</p>
      <p>"Maybe 70% of the industry probably still operates like this today, but these digital systems allow forwarders to speed up the access to information – visibility on capacity, routing and prices – and at the click of button have your transaction and shipment confirmed on a flight."</p>
      <p>He added that this does not mean the elimination of the human element of the air cargo business. Instead, it will allow companies to focus on customer engagement at a strategic level rather than on a transactional basis.</p>
      <p>Claussen added: "The air cargo industry spends a lot of time and resource facilitating transactions, which yield very little advantage to either party on both sides. Taking those resources and freeing them up to be able to actually do what the customer wants us to do and to have a great experience is exactly what we are trying to do here.</p>
      <p>"There is also perhaps a smaller point to that – people are now used to doing things digitally, so there is no reason why as soon as a freight forwarder enters the office they go back 25 years in time and everything revolves around paper, emails and phone calls."</p>
      <p>Looking to the future, Shadid said that Etihad Cargo has plans to continue its digital drive and added that is has an "ambitious investment programme over the next 24 months".</p>
      <p>He said: "Our new technology platform gives us the ability to rapidly build API connectivity to seamlessly link with other platforms so I think cargo.one will be the first non-Etihad Cargo platform that we will link with but there will be a couple of others that will follow suit."</p>
      <p>The ability to connect via APIs also means Etihad Cargo can build direct links with customers' systems, while dynamic pricing and quote-to-book modules are also on the horizon.</p>
      <p>"This is part of a wider strategy of taking our customers from the transactional era and moving them to the experience era with Etihad Cargo," Shadid said.</p>
      <p>"That means not only will we continue to invest in an upgraded EtihadCargo.com, in addition to the API connections with cargo.one others, but we will also extend that digitalisation to other areas of the business, such as our cargo terminal operations and handling businesses."</p>

      <p>Express delivery company TNT has signed up two customers for its new cold chain packaging and shipping service Medpak VI°C, which officially launches this month.</p>
      <p>One is a clinical trial company and the other is a global biotech company. TNT did not reveal who had signed up.</p>
      <p>Medpak VI°C is a reusable temperature-controlled packaging network service to help healthcare manufacturers reduce costs and waste when shipping temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical and biological materials.</p>
      <p>This service is called Medpak VI°C because it guarantees a temperature variance of no more than one degree Celsius during transport.</p>
      <p>Stricter regulations on patient safety and the growth in biologic drugs are increasing the need for proven cold chain logistics solutions, but these are often provided at a high price by specialist firms with no own delivery network.</p>
      <p>With Medpak VI°C, TNT offers an all-inclusive service that combines high-end temperature-controlled packaging solutions with the comfort of a transport integrator's air and road network. The service comes with tracking and monitoring services to ensure compliant cold chain management.</p>
      <p>Central to Medpak VI°C is the patented, cold chain packaging technology from the German company va-Q-tec. This packaging solution uses PCM (phase change materials) and vacuum insulation panels to keep temperature-sensitive packages within defined temperature ranges.</p>
      <p>Readily available at GDP (Good Distribution Practice)-compliant stations, they can maintain chilled, controlled ambient, or frozen temperatures for more than 96 hours.</p>
      <p>TNT provides the boxes on a one-way rental basis, transports the temperature-sensitive materials, and takes the empty boxes back after delivery to the receiver. The receivers can be hospitals, clinics, physicians, manufacturing or pharmaceutical distribution locations.</p>
      <p>This allows healthcare manufacturers to outsource the end-to-end management of packaging, conditioning, transport and return logistics to one global transport integrator.</p>
      <p>TNT industry marketing director for healthcare, Cathy O'Brien says: "Reusing phase change material shippers can lower the cost of quality compliance, whilst reducing risk in the cold chain. With Medpak VI°C, we answer the need for balance between quality and cost, which our customers in the life science and health industry are looking for."</p>
      <p>Healthcare is a priority industry for TNT's transformation and turnaround strategy Outlook.</p>

      <p>IATA has confirmed the finalists for its 2019 Air Cargo Innovation Awards, the original 56 ideas having been whittled down to just three by an independent jury panel.</p>
      <p>The three ideas in the final running for top prize, all of which relate to ULD technological development, are as follows:</p>
      <p>The three finalists are expected to present their respective ideas at the forthcoming 2019 World Cargo Symposium (WCS), the event to be held in Singapore between March 12 and 14.</p>
      <p>Delegates at the event will vote for their preferred idea and the winner will be announced during the closing plenary session of WCS on March 14.</p>
      <p>Wide spectrum</p>
      <p>Those initial 56 entries covered a wide range of innovative ideas, areas of interest including ULDs, digital solutions and track and trace, segments of the industry that benefit from cutting edge and emerging technologies such as block chain and big data.</p>
      <p>The three ideas that have made it to the last round can be summarised as follows:</p>
      <p>Air New Zealand Cargo &amp; Cargo Composites – Keep it cool with aeroTHERM: Air New Zealand recently tested and launched a new thermally insulated aeroTHERM ULD aimed at better protecting temperature-sensitive shipments and reducing costs.</p>
      <p>aeroTHERM, designed by Cargo Composites, is a container fabric door that is said to insulate 25 times better than regular ULDs and curtains, allowing shipments to stay within desired temperature ranges for longer, and reducing the need for thermal covers, wraps and heavier temperature-controlled ULDs.</p>
      <p>SITA, Safran &amp; CHAMP – Smart ULD: Smart ULD combines the latest mobile, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies to solve major pressure points on ULD management. Smart ULD digitally tracks and monitors ULDs during their transport, providing geolocation, temperature/shock/vibration/pressure alerts and digital damage reports.</p>
      <p>It aims to reduce the disruptive impact of the loss or misplacement of ULDs, as well as moving ULD handling from paper to digital formats.</p>
      <p>Smart ULD leverages a specific event-driven blockchain.</p>
      <p>Unilode Aviation Solutions – Digital Transformation: Unilode's Digital Transformation concept is designed to allow for the fast and easy introduction of IoT technology to the world of ULD management and to the air cargo supply chain. It incorporates a Bluetooth-based tracking solution for ULDs to improve transparency across the air cargo supply chain.</p>
      <p>In this model, Bluetooth-equipped ULDs will allow customers to use the load device as a proxy for tracking and transmitting status updates of their cargo, while offering improved inventory control and damage reduction of ULD fleets.</p>
      <p>The applied technology will at the same time record temperature, humidity, shock and light data that can be used by the customer to create their own service offering for products including perishables, valuables or sensitive cargo.</p>

      <p>Changi Airport Group (CAG) announced that it had formalised the Pharma@Changi initiative, together with its partners from the air cargo supply chain. This new community will work towards the continuous strengthening of Changi's capabilities to handle pharmaceutical air cargo.Together with CAG, the partner companies who signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) are Bollore Logistics, CEVA logistics Singapore, DHL Global Forwarding, dnata Singapore, Expeditors Singapore, Global Airfreight International, SATS, Schenker Singapore and Singapore Airlines Cargo. These nine companies, which span across the air cargo supply chain, have achieved the IATA Centre of Excellence for Independent Validators Certification for Pharmaceutical Handling (IATA CEIV Pharma).As part of the MOU, the companies will jointly pursue the best standards in pharmaceuticals handling and will promote Singapore Changi Airport as pharmaceuticals air cargo hub in the region. This includes initiatives such as assessing new and emerging pharmaceutical logistics trends and technologies, as well as the implementation of pilot projects.Changi Airport Group's managing director for Air Hub Development Lim Ching Kiat, said, "As the first air cargo community in Asia Pacific to attain the IATA CEIV Pharma certification, the new Pharma@Changi initiative aims to further solidify the partnership among air cargo players at Changi Airport in strengthening Singapore's capabilities, by jointly pursuing the best standards in pharmaceuticals air cargo handling. Over the last three years, pharmaceutical cargo has consistently ranked among the top five cargo types transported via airfreight globally, in terms of total value. In the first eight months of 2017, Changi Airport handled more than 15,500 tonnes of pharmaceutical cargo."IATA's senior vice president, Airport, Passenger, Cargo and Security, Nick Careen said, "The Asian freight market is the largest in the world, accounting for 40% of total global trade. The creation of Pharma@Changi, by Changi Airport, one of the largest transportation hubs in South East Asia, is the first air cargo community in Asia Pacific. This is great news for the supply of pharmaceuticals across the region. Pharma shippers at Changi Airport can now be assured that they are receiving the highest quality service in terms of standardisation and transparency."Singapore Airlines Cargo's president, Chin Yau Seng, said, "We are proud to be part of Pharma@Changi. As part of this initiative, we endeavour to deepen our collaboration to achieve the highest standards of pharmaceutical handling, while upholding a reliable cool-chain network which extends beyond the Singapore hub, to Asia Pacific and the rest of the world. In addition, we will remain active in adopting new technology to meet customer needs."A leading cargo hub in Asia and among the top 10 in the world for international airfreight, Changi Airport handled a record 1.97 million tonnes of cargo in 2016. At Changi Airfreight Centre, more than 300,000 sqm of temperature-controlled facilities (dnata Coolchain and SATS Coolport) with multi-tiered zones and individual cold rooms are equipped to handle temperature-sensitive cargo.CAG is also part of Pharma.Aero, an alliance founded by Brussels and Miami Airport, committed to sharing best practices and market knowledge to improve pharmaceutical handling for the air cargo industry worldwide.</p>

      <p>Just six months after its launch in Hong Kong, the U-Freight Group is taking e+Solutions, its logistics product designed for e-commerce start-ups, to the Malaysian marketplace.</p>
      <p>The U-Freight Group launched e+ Solutions to help the growing number of small businesses, which are looking to capitalise on the global e-commerce market, with their logistics needs.</p>
      <p>Often those start-ups have limited resources and are looking for cost effective behind-the-scenes assistance with order fulfilment, plus associated logistics and administration operations.</p>
      <p>The new e+ Solutions service is being rolled out to U-Freight's e-commerce fulfilment centre (EFC) in Penang to offer a comprehensive e-commerce logistics package: from dedicated storage space for the entrepreneurs' products, to order processing and fulfilment services, including final delivery to customers.</p>
      <p>It offers the owners of these small start-up e-commerce businesses the constant support of a workforce that already has significant experience in fulfilling e-commerce orders on an international level.</p>
      <p>U-Freight's EFC in Penang has been equipped with the necessary hardware for storing and order processing, plus the associated software that is required for system integration and end-to-end data transparency. A wide range of value-added or customised services are also available.</p>
      <p>By using e+ Solutions, small entrepreneurs in Malaysia will now have more time to concentrate on adding value to their products and optimising their marketing and sales development initiatives.</p>
      <p>They will benefit from complete data transparency, with real time inventory updates, plus web and mobile app access for immediate management and status updates of order instructions, plus subsequent live reporting of delivery tracking.</p>
      <p>The customers of these small start-up e-commerce entrepreneurs will receive push notifications on order status, and the service will be backed by a 'live chat' facility enabling instant customer services follow up.</p>
      <p>And, of course, those small business start-ups that have regular orders and want to expand their business to overseas markets, can take confidence from the fact that the U-Freight group has been successfully providing international freight forwarding services for the last 50 years.</p>
      <p>U-Freight Group chief executive officer Simon Wong says: "When we launched e+Solutions earlier this year, we said we would be looking to take the model to some of our other distribution centres in markets where small entrepreneurs are using online channels and platforms dedicated to e-commerce, to sell their own designs and products.</p>
      <p>"We are confident that the roll out of e+Solutions to Malaysia will be as successful as the operation in Hong Kong where it is now a proven example of how we are utilising technology and infrastructure to help deliver bespoke logistics solutions."</p>

      <p>Unilode Aviation Solutions recently mooted a plan to accelerate digital transformation for ULD management solutions, by bringing to the market a tracking solution based on a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tag.</p>
      <p>The tracking solution will be fully embedded into the structure of ULDs, which will be supported by a global interoperable reader infrastructure.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to implement its digitisation programme, Unilode has teamed up with technology provider OnAsset Intelligence Inc, and a leading ULD manufacturer.</p>
      <p>Unilode customers, Cathay Pacific, Air Canada, Cargolux and AirBridgeCargo are among the airlines who are involved in the digitisation programme, which will be rolled out this year. Several shippers are expected to partaking in the digitisation.</p>
      <p>Benoît Dumont, CEO, Unilode Aviation Solutions said: "We have decided to accelerate the use of modern technology in the ULD management solutions. After winning the inaugural IATA Air Cargo Innovation Award in 2015, we worked closely with our customers to enhance our digital tracking technology, with user input across the end-to-end value chain.</p>
      <p>"Unilode does not intend to lock itself, its customers and industry partners into proprietary technologies, and hence has decided to make public all APIs, which is necessary to capture information from its digitally enabled platforms. This approach will greatly enhance interoperability and flexibility for our customers," said Dumont.</p>
      <p>Adam Crossno, CEO, OnAsset Intelligence said: "I am excited to build on what has already been a very successful cooperation with Unilode Aviation Solutions. As all of us know the primary concern in our industry is safety, and therefore it's essential that digital technologies comply with all safety regulations in our industry."</p>
      <p>"OnAsset has always focused on full compliance with industry regulations, and we are well known for our patented FlightSafe technology, which has allowed our products to receive approval from the FAA and EASA as well as over 80 global airlines," said Crossno.</p>
      <p>Along with Unilode, we have been focusing on making sure the technology is safe, compliant, fit for purpose and technically sound. Our common vision is that this technology should be accessible for all stakeholders in the value chain, so that intelligent ULDs can be leveraged by airlines, ground handlers, freight forwarders and shippers. This is extremely important because quite often the tracking challenges arise when shipments leave their expected route and are not found where they are expected to be," said Crossno.</p>

      <p>Hot on the heels of its expansion in Australia and New Zealand, Peli BioThermal has acquired a temperature-controlled packaging provider in the US: NanoCool.</p>
      <p>The Albuquerque, New Mexico-based manufacturer produces cold chain shipping containers that can be stored at room temperature, with no need to refrigerate or precondition them. Instead, when the user activates a container's cooling technology it quickly conditions the space for shipping biological patient samples and other life science materials.</p>
      <p>NanoCool customers include specialist couriers, diagnostic laboratories, clinical supply providers and gene and cell therapy organisations.</p>
      <p>The company also has a dry-ice friendly parcel shipper and a version of its cooling engine that patients can send in a shipping envelope from their homes.</p>
      <p>While the core competency of both businesses is "very much aligned", Peli BioThermal president David Williams said there is little overlap between their market segments and product technologies.</p>
      <p>"Adding NanoCool's capabilities to our diverse product line will help fuel our efforts to expand our offerings and bring further innovation to growing sectors of the life sciences industry spanning the globe," he said.</p>
      <p>Doug Smith, founder of NanoCool, observed: "Since we primarily serve customers in the US, we look forward to leveraging Peli BioThermal's extensive global network to bring our innovative technology to more areas of the world – especially to areas where temperature-control is crucial."</p>
      <p>Smith will stay on at NanoCool as a consultant and the firm's facility in New Mexico will continue to manufacture its products, with plans to increase production as well as, potentially, staffing.</p>

      <p>Abu Dhabi Airports and Etihad Cargo have announced plans for a major airfreight facility boost for the Middle East airline's hub at Abu Dhabi International Airport.</p>
      <p>The partners will implement a "multi-phased cargo infrastructure development" strategy, starting with the imminent upgrade of Etihad's existing air cargo terminal facilities on the Southside airport perimeter.</p>
      <p>The programme will culminate with the inauguration of Etihad Cargo's new air cargo terminal in the East Midfield section of the airport, an area designated by Abu Dhabi Airports for future integrated cargo, logistics and integrator activities.</p>
      <p>The upgrading of the Southside Etihad cargo facilities will commence immediately and is due for completion in phases at the end of the third quarter in 2020.</p>
      <p>The scope includes the enhancement of road feeder service (RFS) loading docks with levelers, insulation and floor works for faster and more efficient loading with stricter temperature controls.</p>
      <p>There will also be increased storage space and additional build-up and breakdown zones to improve production workflow, and upgraded cool chain facilities for both its fresh and pharma handling and storage operations.</p>
      <p>A joint statement said: "This phase will not only increase efficiency and productivity in the existing facilities to support air cargo growth at Abu Dhabi International Airport for the coming five years, but it will also enhance Etihad's pharmaceutical logistics capability through a dedicated Southside Pharma Terminal, adding 3,500 sq m of space for temperature-controlled handling and storage across both 2-8 degrees Celsius and 15-25 degrees Celsius categories."</p>
      <p>Abu Dhabi Airports and Etihad Cargo have agreed as a next step to designate a plot of land at the East Midfield site.</p>
      <p>A joint team will soon be inviting expressions of interest to bid for the design and construction of Etihad Cargo's next generation facility that will mark "the creation of one the world's most advanced and automated air cargo terminals".</p>
      <p>The facility will be designed to handle incremental UAE import and export demand, boost Etihad's growing cargo network flows as well as cater for the "significant rise" in e-commerce and express mail and cargo operations.</p>
      <p>Bryan Thompson, chief executive of Abu Dhabi Airports, commented: "Geographically, Abu Dhabi is situated at the heart of the east to west trade routes. Additionally, the transport and logistics fabric of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is well planned and structured to create undeniable potential to grow the cargo traffic exponentially."</p>
      <p>"Today we are putting in place the right foundations and frameworks for our future cargo activity, which in a few years will re-shape this industry for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is the future's cargo hub for the region and the world." </p>
      <p>Etihad Aviation Group chief executive Tony Douglas said: "Today's announcement is a major milestone in the development of Etihad Cargo's logistics strategy that will see our hub continue to grow as one of the world's most important trade facilitators connecting East and West.</p>
      <p>"The immediate investment in the Southside terminal will deliver a step change in the efficiency and capability of our existing facilities while the announcement of the development of a new facility reinforces Etihad's commitment to develop Abu Dhabi as a world class hub for the logistics of the future."</p>
      <p>In addition, Abu Dhabi Airports is setting the groundwork for the first phase of a bonded, non-bonded and free zone area adjoining the airport, designated as "Al Falah Free Zone", which it will develop as a prime location for e-commerce fulfilment and logistics warehousing.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Cargo and Sonoco ThermoSafe, a leading global provider of temperature assurance packaging, recently entered into a partnership agreement to the lease the PharmaPort 360 temperature-controlled bulk shipping container.</p>
      <p>The agreement will enable pharmaceutical shippers to lease PharmaPort 360 containers directly from Cathay Pacific Cargo.</p>
      <p>Cathay is the first Hong Kong-based airline to obtain IATA CEIV Pharma Certification, which has boosted its Pharma LIFT capabilities, and offered its global customers with a leading hybrid option to move time-sensitive, high-value medications by air.</p>
      <p>Frosti Lau, general manager cargo service delivery, Cathay Pacific said: "Sonoco's reputation for quality aligns with our own high standards for service delivery. We are delighted to have this unique, and world's-first partnership with Sonoco ThermoSafe, and we are confident that this collaboration will provide our customers with a consistent solution to transport vital and life-saving pharmaceutical products."</p>
      <p>The PharmaPort 360 is powered with proprietary hybrid technology to ensure extremely precise five degree Celsius temperature control. Once charged, the PharmaPort functions like an active temperature controlled container, without the energy consumption, or heat discharge like other compressor-based technologies.</p>
      <p>The PharmaPort's hybrid technology allows it to operate on battery power, which lasts substantially longer than other active units used for bulk air shipments. It also eliminates the need for refrigerated trucks for lengthy truck lanes. Additionally, it contains a fully integrated, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved telemetry system, which provides real-time, cloud-based data on payload and ambient temperature, precisely synchronised with GPS location.</p>
      <p>Vishal Khushalani, director of global marketing &amp; business development, Sonoco Protective Solutions said: "The PharmaPort 360 provides best-in-class active temperature control, by utilising a hybrid technology that strictly controls temperature to five degree Celsius. It also provides real-time temperature and location visibility across the supply chain. The container is easy to use, and is versatile across transportation modes."</p>
      <p>"By taking the extra time to build in the integrated telemetry, we focused on providing advanced visibility to eliminate chances of product loss.  Everyone using the PharmaPort's data services can view each container's internal and external temperature, and location at any time, and the transportation supply chain can respond effectively to any challenges that arise," said Khushalani.</p>

      <p>Zurich-based carrier Swiss WorldCargo, the air cargo division of Swiss International Airlines, has gained its CEIV-Pharma certification this week, assuring that all segments of its supply chain network, operating in more than 84 countries, meet the strict temperature-control standards set by IATA.</p>
      <p>The carrier, while small, has carved out a niche in the sector of transporting pharmaceuticals internationally out of Western Europe. In 2016, it introduced "quality corridors"– or dedicated pharma traffic lanes – in partnership with cargo handler Cargologic, and food and gateways services provider Singapore Airport Terminal Services Ltd. (SATS). The consortium launched the service with a Singapore-Zurich route.</p>
      <p>Swiss WorldCargo is also recognized as compliant with the Good Distribution Practices (GDP) standards by government authority Swissmedic – which issues GDP certificates to Switzerland-based companies. The merits of IATA's pharma certificate have often been compared to the GDP's standards.</p>
      <p>There are major players on both sides of the fence – GDP-compliant companies including Panalpina, dnata, Cargolux Airlines and Emirates SkyCargo – along with Delta Cargo, Cathay Pacific, All Nippon Airways and Hactl, which hold CEIV-pharma certifications. While many pharma-centric companies opt for one or the other, some diversify their portfolios with a combination of the two frameworks, like Swiss WorldCargo.</p>
      <p>Industry leaders have their own opinions on the debate – Nathan de Valck, cargo manager at major pharma-hub Brussels Airport has said that GDP standards are a good foundation, but that there is "no real checklist," associated with the framework. IATA's CEIV standards, on the other hand, "actually take GDP standards and translate them to actionable items for our industry," he said.</p>
      <p>Looking forward, Swiss WorldCargo said it will continue to develop its "pharma road map to improve its footprint in the important and growing segment of pharmaceuticals and life sciences."</p>

      <p>In a recent development, China Airlines has entered into a master lease agreement (MLA) with leading manufacture of high performance active and passive temperature management solutions provider CSafe Global to offer temperature controled transport of healthcare and pharmaceutical freight.</p>
      <p>China Airlines has confirmed to have signed the MAL with CSafe Global, which will help its healthcare and pharmaceutical customers who require strict temperature control of their products during transport. Its pharma customers will benefit from access to CSafe's industry-leading cold chain technology and global customer support.</p>
      <p>Brad Jennings, vp of global marketing of CSafe Global said, "With 97 destinations across 27 countries, China Airlines has a comprehensive network serving pharmaceutical companies around the world. CSafe and our customers are very excited about the addition of China Airlines to our airline partner network and look forward to a fruitful and long-term collaboration."</p>
      <p>The CSafe RKN active temperature-controlled system was specifically developed for the life-sciences, pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, and is the only compressor-driven air cargo container of its kind with approvals to fly on either upper deck or lower deck of aircraft.</p>
      <p>The superior performance of the CSafe RKN can be attributed to the thermal capabilities of its ThermoCor insulation, which provides extended operating efficiencies, as well as unit's proprietary air movement, heating and cooling technologies that allow the temperature-controlled container to maintain a consistent user-selected payload set-point across ambient temperatures as extreme as -30 degrees celsius up to  49 degrees celsius. The operating efficiency of the active unit allows for a full payload to be shipped inside the container without the need for secondary packaging.</p>
      <p>It makes CSafe RKN a cost-effective solution compared to dry ice and other passive solutions. The container's best-in-class active system performance, data logging capabilities, and ease of use make it a very good selection for inclusion in a pharmaceutical company's standard operating procedures for air-cargo transportation of valuable life-science products.</p>

      <p>Fraport and Swissport Cargo Services Deutschland have laid the foundation stone for the cargo handler's new facility at Frankfurt Airport.</p>
      <p>The new building in CargoCity South will expand Swissport's handling capacity by almost 50% and meet requirements for state-of-the-art airfreight handling.</p>
      <p>The warehouse includes a material handling system allowing containers and pallets to be automatically stored in and removed from the facility.</p>
      <p>The cargo centre will be fitted out in accordance with strict IATA criteria and will be CEIV Pharma certified after going into operation.</p>
      <p>The roof will have the first large-scale photovoltaic system at Frankfurt Airport, generating 1.5 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year.</p>
      <p>Felix Kreutel, senior vice president of real estate and properties at Fraport says: "Fraport operates Europe's largest cargo hub at Frankfurt Airport. We intend to write another chapter in this success story together with our long-standing customer Swissport. To achieve this, we are continuously optimising our service and product range and offering intelligent infrastructure solutions for our customers."</p>
      <p>The building will handle up to 200,000 tonnes of airfreight a year, with Willy Ruf, Swissport's senior vice president Central and Eastern Europe commenting: "We are looking forward to offering our customers individual air cargo services at one of Europe's most modern and sustainable airfreight facilities starting in the autumn of 2020. Frankfurt Airport thus remains one of the most important airfreight locations in our global Swissport network."</p>
      <p>Handover is scheduled for the third quarter of 2020, and the facility was designed by M&amp;P Architekten, with Goldbeck acting as general contractor.</p>

      <p>Brussels Airport has launched its first application using blockchain technology, marking the next step in the Landsite Management tool it is developing with stakeholders at BRUcargo.</p>
      <p>The app will closely cooperate with existing apps such as the Slot Booking App, or future apps yet to be developed.</p>
      <p>The focus of the next phase is to make the import process paperless, more efficient and transparent, contributing to Brussels' strategic objective to have a digitalised logistical flow in place supported by a combination of applications offered via the BRUcloud platform.</p>
      <p>Compared to other cargo community systems, the BRUcloud's main priority is not digitising the existing messages and communication between the different actors but making data sharing in a cloud environment possible.</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport cargo business development manager, Sara Van Gelder says: "It enables the different stakeholders of the air cargo supply chain to work more "integrated" and act as a network. Data will be stored only once, centrally. Once a company is connected to the cloud, it can start using the different existing applications and can start exchanging information very easily with other stakeholders instead of maintaining system-to-system connections with all different partners individually."</p>
      <p>Brussels Airport head of cargo and logistics, Steven Polmans who is also chairman of Air Cargo Belgium adds: "The new Freight Management App 1.0 will replace the handover of cargo from handlers to forwarder from a paper-based process by a digital rights / release process. The support of all our stakeholders, from gathering ideas to implementing new tools and applications, is crucial in the success of our BRUcloud platform."</p>
      <p>One of the companies supporting BRUcloud is DHL Global Forwarding, with chief executive officer for Belgium and Luxembourg, Luc Jacobs saying: "DHL Global Forwarding is pro-actively seeking supply chain visibility and transparency tools and improvement areas, in order to facilitate the supply chain of our customers.</p>
      <p>"We firmly believe that an increasing transparency and reliability will decrease the overall supply chain costs in the future. We support initiatives as the community platform BRUcloud, to support the industry in creating innovative tools to improve the logistic chain."</p>
      <p>Ground handler WFS has also supported the programme, with regional vice president Marc Claesen commenting: "For WFS, this is the way forward in a rapidly changing industry, whereby expectations from stakeholders will only be met in the future by those companies who believe in modernisation and industry data sharing. We are glad to be an early adaptor of this unique tool and platform and believe that this is only the start of a very promising development whereby the cargo industry as a whole will benefit, with Brussels taking a leading pioneer role."</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo has become the first airline in the Middle East to be awarded IATA CEIV certification in Pharmaceutical Logistics.</p>
      <p>The certification covers both airline operations of Etihad Cargo as well as cargo handling and warehousing at its hub in Abu Dhabi International Airport.</p>
      <p>Abdulla Mohamed Shadid, managing director cargo and logistics at Etihad Aviation Group says Etihad Cargo is "honoured" to be the first airline in the region to be awarded IATA CEIV Pharma.</p>
      <p>He says: "Since we launched our refreshed strategy in early 2018, a lot of focus has gone towards enhancing our premium product verticals and offering the highest quality and reliability standards to our customers. Today our TempCheck product receives a major boost with this important certification."</p>
      <p>Cargo handling subsidiary Etihad Airport Services has also been awarded CEIV Pharma certification and the airline says that through its global network and fleet of passenger and cargo aircraft, this reaffirms Etihad's ability to offer temperature-controlled services.</p>
      <p>Facilities, systems and processes have been enhanced to meet CEIV Pharma demands, which combine IATA Temperature Control Regulations, GDP best practices and other international benchmarks.</p>
      <p>Enhancements include the use of cool dollies in Abu Dhabi, thermal blankets at key stations and a tie up with additional active container suppliers to expand options of temperature-controlled containers.</p>
      <p>Etihad also commenced a major expansion and refurbishment programme to its cargo terminal in Abu Dhabi in the fourth quarter of 2018, which aims to add additional temperature-controlled space to its existing pharma zone by 2020.</p>
      <p>Shadid says 2018 was a "pivotal year", with the focus on Boeing 777 Freighters, the launch of FlightValet and FreshForward, and the digital migration to the iCargo technology platform.</p>
      <p>He says: "CEIV Pharma presents us with the perfect start to the year, setting a baseline for what we need to accomplish to reaffirm our place as a true air cargo partner of choice."</p>

      <p>Liege Airport will host a forum and networking event focussed on sharing best practices and defining common objectives to achieve excellence in air cargo on December 4, 2017. This event will be concluded by the celebration of 20 years of collaboration between the airport and Cargo Airlines (CAL).</p>
      <p>As Luc Partoune, CEO of Liege Airport, says, "Quality and efficiency of service is a matter of objectives, means and most of all, the commitment of all players. When speaking of a high value and very specialized service like air cargo, what matters first is the shared view, in a global and a local sense, and joint involvement of the stakeholders to deliver the best quality products and meet shippers' and customers' expectations".</p>
      <p>A leading player in the air cargo sector, Liege Airport hopes that this forum will gather high level testimonials, research and visions of the key aspects of excellence in air cargo. A series of talks will be organised with the participation of specialists from the world-over. A call for papers and presentations is being launched on the following themes:</p>
      <p>Market expectations and needs, from shippers to consumers: Understanding and foreseeing what services are expected and required from healthcare and pharma sensitive products to humanitarian logistics, transport of live animals, e-commerce driven solutions, etc.</p>
      <p>The keys to achieving excellence: Raising service levels through innovation, technological breakthroughs, airlines' norms and vision for the future, dedicated infrastructure, human resources, certifications, etc.</p>

      <p>DHL Global Forwarding has introduced a new online service for shippers to compare air and ocean freight based on rates and lead times while providing visibility of all available options.</p>
      <p>The new tool, myDHLi Quote &amp; Book, allows customers to compare quotations and make instant bookings, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for air and ocean freight and even for door-to-door shipments.</p>
      <p>The service guides customers through the quotation journey and enables them to directly compare available options, including DHL Ocean Connect LCL (less-than-container-load) as well as two speeds of air freight, DHL Air Connect and DHL Air Economy.</p>
      <p>Users can also book transport insurance for the shipment in just a few clicks.</p>
      <p>Tim Scharwath, CEO DHL Global Forwarding, Freight said: "During the development of myDHLi Quote &amp; Book, we listened to our customers' needs and improved upon our prior online tool. We added new features, increased coverage and implemented a highly intuitive user interface to achieve a simple and effective customer experience."</p>
      <p>The easy-to-navigate tool allows instant access to air and ocean freight quotes with a minimum of information required. Transparent air and ocean freight quotes allow customers to compare rates and lead times to select the best option. For air freight, customers can choose between DHL Air Connect, an efficient solution with a typical delivery time of 3-5 days, and DHL Air Economy, a cost effective option that uses alternative carriers and routes to deliver in about 5-7 days. Both booking options cover general cargo up to 2,000 kg per shipment. For ocean freight, instant quotes are generated for LCL shipments up to 10,000 kg/ 20cbm per shipment. In addition, DHL Global Forwarding is one of the first freight forwarders offering an insurance option with its online quotation and booking service. To calculate the insurance, customers simply select the right transport mode and product and enter the good's value.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, customers can save quotes and share them with selected recipients via e-mail or directly continue to booking.</p>
      <p>Upon booking, customers are informed via an email containing tracking information and an overview of the ordered service.</p>
      <p>Shippers and consignees can complete their purchases using all common pre-paid, collect and cross-trade terms. myDHLi Quote &amp; Book is currently available in more than 60 countries representing 98 percent of all ocean and air freight volumes.</p>
      <p>In addition, customers may request a quote for special cargo, including dangerous goods, lithium batteries and non-stackable cargo, which is provided in a separate email from DHL.</p>
      <p>The new myDHLi Quote &amp; Book saves time for customers and helps them take the right decisions in terms of transport mode and transit time.</p>

    <title>Cargo iQ adds air cargo intelligence hub</title>

    <content>
      <p>Cargo iQ has launched a new intelligence hub giving members real-time information on performance and  allowing them to compare themselves against the organisation's standards and the community overall. The performance data measures each individual cargo journey from shipper to consignee against 16 milestones. Through analysis of the data generated by these measurements, members can work with their customers and suppliers to improve performance, develop new products, and drive quality in the air cargo industry, Cargo iQ said. Cargo iQ executive director Ariaen Zimmerman explained: "Our members can now analyse their data and see it in an easy to understand, meaningful way; giving them the tools to focus their resources to where they need to improve processes, and supporting them to optimise their products and requirements both for their industry partners and of course, our customers, the shippers. "Members will be better able to explain to current and potential customers exactly what it is they are paying for, and offer them a choice of products – something new and refreshing for the somewhat traditional air freight sector." The hub is one of a series of initiatives aimed at improving the value Cargo iQ delivers to its members and to the industry as a whole, which has included the appointment of independent auditors. Zimmerman recently called on the industry to stop focusing on speeding up  transport times and to instead concentrate on differentiating products  based on the level of reliability on offer. Being able to compare reliability against industry standards using the Cargo iQ portal, would play a part in this, he said at the time. He said that the industry  has spent too long trying to speed up transport times when there are  already products on the market that offer faster services. He explained that shippers were not necessarily willing to pay extra  for faster times, and if they were, they could use a whole array of  existing air cargo products or even choose one of the integrators under a  completely different cost model. He added that only two of the 5.4 days of air cargo's average  door-to-door journey time were under carrier control, offering little  room for improvement. He suggested carriers should offer different pricing structures based on reliability rates. "We should create a reality where if people are unhappy about a  product they can go out and buy a better product or talk to an airline  and ask if there is a way to create another product that better suits  their needs. "People should be perfectly happy to value, for instance, an 85%  reliability within a certain performance window at a specific price  level and then accept that a higher reliability at a stricter  performance window should be valued at a different price." </p>

      <p>Supply chain services giant Kuehne + Nagel (K+N) has invested in 50 temperature-controlled trailers to grow its dedicated road-haul pharma network in Belgium and Luxembourg. The trailers have built-in Discharge Air Control (DAC) and Precision Temperature Control (PTC) technology, protecting their loads from temperature deviations. According to K+N, it is "one of the first logistics providers (to be) equipped with such a large number of temperature-controlled trailers for serving the pharmaceutical industry". The company has more than 100 of the trailers operating across Europe. "We are committed to investing in best-in-class equipment to ensure our customers' products arrive at their destination safe and completely intact through shipping fully compliant according to temperature guidelines," observed Kevin Nash, managing director Belgium &amp; Luxembourg. "The expansion further solidifies KN PharmaChain as a leading pharma logistics service in Europe and as part of our global network," he added. Earlier this month (March), K+N announced its 2016 results. The company pointed out that its "leading solution for temperature-sensitive goods, pharmaceutical or perishable products, generated significant new business". Moreover, "The improved margins and operational efficiency led to further growth in profitability." Not long before that, K+N confirmed that it had gained IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators for pharmaceutical handling (CEIV Pharma) certification covering its entire KN PharmaChain GxP air network, currently incorporating 86 locations on all continents.</p>

      <p>Tom Windmuller, IATA's senior VP airports, passenger, cargo and security, presented Sebastiaan Scholte, chief executive of Jan de Rijk Logistics and chairman of the Cool Chain Association, with a framed Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Pharma certificate during the World Cargo Symposium (WCS).</p>
      <p>The ceremony marked the company's successful audit by the IATA CEIV, underlining its competence in managing temperature-controlled pharma shipments. Swissport's handling operation in Brussels also received CEIV accreditation during the event.</p>
      <p>"The CEIV programme is really taking off," Windmuller said. "Eleven companies at Brussels Airport took part in the first round of company visits and seven have now been accredited." Nine more operators are following into the programme in a second wave this year.</p>
      <p>IATA launched the initiative in January 2014 to ensure airlines, handlers and air freight forwarders are compliant with changing international pharma handling regulations, and to help them reverse the trend of modal shift in this fast-growing market.</p>
      <p>Under the CEIV programme, IATA assesses companies' cool chain processes and facilities, reviews the pharmaceutical handling training status of relevant personnel, and provides skills training where required.</p>
      <p>Brussels' approach was to bring its cargo community together and encourage ground handlers, forwarders, trucking companies and airlines to jointly undertake CEIV training, and thus strengthen its credentials as a pharmaceutical hub. It was the first site in Europe to do this, following the lead taken by SATS Coolport in Singapore.</p>

      <p>ULD solutions are set to dominate the 2019 IATA Air Cargo Innovation Awards, will all three finalists coming from the sector.</p>
      <p>The companies, selected from a 56-strong field, are: Air New Zealand thermally-insulated aeroTHERM ULDs offering better protection of temperature-sensitive shipments; SITA, Safran &amp; CHAMP for their Smart ULD which combines the latest mobile, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies to solve major pain-points on ULD management; and Unilode Aviation Solutions' Digital Transformation concept to introduce IoT to the world of ULD management and the air cargo supply chain.</p>
      <p>Air New Zealand's aeroTHERM, designed by Cargo Composites, is a container fabric door that insulates 25 times better than regular ULDs and curtains, allowing shipments to stay within desired temperature ranges for longer, reducing the use of thermal covers, wraps and heavier temperature controlled ULDs.</p>
      <p>The SITA, Safran &amp; CHAMP Smart ULD can be monitored during transport, and offers geolocation, temperature, shock, vibration and pressure alerts and digital damage reports. It aims to reduce loss or misplacement of ULDs, as well as moving ULD handling from paper to digital formats.</p>
      <p>Unilode and its partners have developed a Bluetooth-based tracking solution for load devices that will allow customers to use the load device as a proxy for tracking and transmitting status updates of their cargo. It will record temperature, humidity, shock and light information.</p>
      <p>The three finalists will present their submission to delegates at the 13th IATA World Cargo Symposium in Singapore. The winner will be announced during the closing plenary of the event on 14 March.</p>

      <p>The Air Cargo Community Frankfurt's internet presence now has a fresh new look (www.FRA-fr8.com). The new website now provides full details of companies, institutions and organisations and is geared to an international audience, being completely bilingual in German and English. It now has a modern layout and a responsive design, so that its contents can be easily read on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. Executive director of the Air Cargo Community Frankfurt, Joachim von Winning, said that, as well as providing information, a prime function of the new site was "to generate curiosity – about the community, about its members and about the entire location. Frankfurt Airport has a whole series of strengths and special services, which are valued by shippers, freight forwarders and airlines all over the world." Von Winning added that the encouragingly high number of visitors to the page in the past few weeks was also an indication of the high level of interest in the Community and its work inside and outside the logistics industry.  The Frankfurt's Air Cargo Community has 33 members, representing the entire air cargo process chain, and committed to keeping the airport as Europe's number one cargo hub. Competence teams focus on the optimisation of procedures and processes, marketing and temperature-controlled transport, in particular, on the transport of pharmaceuticals.</p>

      <p>DHL Supply Chain will invest $300m in deploying new technology and transportation control towers in 350 of its 430 North American facilities as it looks to improve productivity.  The logistics giant said that deployment of the technologies, such as robotics, augmented reality, robotics process automation, IoT and DHL's proprietary end-to-end visibility solution – MySupplyChain -, will vary by customer needs, based on the outcomes of research and pilot programmes. In certain cases the technologies have produced productivity gains upwards of 25% and throughput capacity gains of 30%. The availability of these technologies is expected to help customers remove capacity constraints, and maximize service to their customers. DHL Supply Chain North America chief executive Scott Sureddin said: "This investment is about a holistic view of emerging technologies that enables our customers to achieve their growth and profitability goals. "Our customers' needs are not homogenous as each business and segment has unique challenges and levels of maturity. Therefore, it is important that our customers can benefit from our experiences and expertise with a variety of emerging technologies." According to a recent DHL report, the exponential growth of e-commerce and its implications on service was identified by 65% percent of responding companies as having a significant impact on their supply chain. "Executives are turning to technology in support of faster delivery times to efficiently manage fluctuating demand. In alignment with this trend, DHL is already leveraging emerging technologies at approximately 85 of its 430 North American facilitie," the company said. "While many technologies are already in active deployment, collaborative piece-picking robots, artificial intelligence applications and self-driving vehicles stand to have the most promise today," added Sureddin. The company said that the deployment of this technology was not about replacing people. Tim Sprosty, senior vice President of Human Resources at DHL Supply Chain, said: "These technologies enhance the value of our people; they don't replace them. Our team will be equipped with the most advanced technologies, trained on emerging ones and retained through a culture of innovation, collaboration and recognition. We believe this approach is a winning strategy not just for our business but for our customers' businesses as well." Earlier this year, DHL broke ground on its Americas Innovation Center that will exhibit the technologies and innovations the business is already implementing across the region.

      <p>Etihad Cargo's digitalisation drive continues with the launch of its Cargo Control Centre (CCC) at its head office in Abu Dhabi, to enhance Etihad Cargo's "delivery as planned" promise to its customers.</p>
      <p>The cargo and logistics arm of the Etihad Aviation Group says it is the "nerve centre" for real-time monitoring, tracking and active management of all shipments, flights, and UAE road feeder services.</p>
      <p>It offers 24/7 monitoring of Etihad's cargo flows, departures and arrivals, across the network, in addition to real-time monitoring of its road feeder services across the UAE.</p>
      <p>The new center is enabled with the requisite technology to expand this real-time road feeder service oversight to more than 100 lanes in Europe and the Americas over the coming months.</p>
      <p>"The centre's core technology platform builds on Etihad Cargo's booking and reservation system SPRINT by introducing key "always-on" tracking functionalities. These include shipment planning and performance monitoring across its five dedicated freighter aircraft as well as bellyhold shipments across more than 250 daily passenger flights," said the carrier through a statement.</p>
      <p>The unique tools at the CCC help the carrier to resolve any "irregularities" or service recovery matters.</p>
      <p>This ultimately leads to Etihad Cargo increasing its Cargo IQ metrics, an IATA initiative to set an industry measure through which any airline is measured by its percentage of shipments that are delivered as planned.</p>
      <p>In a second phase, Etihad Cargo plans to add further functionality to the CCC to allow monitoring of its Quick Ramp Transfer shipments at its Abu Dhabi International Airport HUB, providing instant alerts on potentially problematic connections and allowing the customer service team to pro-actively take immediate corrective action.</p>
      <p>Separately, Advanced Cargo Information (ACI) monitoring, which sends automated alerts on custom conflicts to minimize the time spent checking individual shipment documentation, will be configured on 10 of Etihad Cargo's busiest routes by the end of the year which will support timely clearance of shipments at destination.</p>
      <p>"By implementing data-driven technology and harnessing the ever-changing digital landscape, we have created a customer-friendly software that provides our team with market leading tools to better serve our customers when they need it most," said Rory Fidler, Etihad Cargo's head of Technology and Innovation.</p>
      <p>Etihad Airways recently marked the first year of its ambitious digitalisation program, which went live with iCargo in October 2018.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Brussels Airport have launched an airport-to-airport (A2A) pharma corridor for temperature-sensitive medicines that will pioneer a global network of specialist pharma corridors. Pharma shipments travelling the Hong Kong-Brussels airports corridor  will be handled in strict compliance with the CEIV Pharma standards and  carried by CEIV Pharma-certified airlines. As part of the new service, Hong Kong's airport is adding 19 common-use, temperature-controlled cool dollies to its ground fleet for the ramp transfer of pharma goods by airlines, plus it is also building apron shelters to protect pharma shipments from direct weather elements. The initiative is in collaboration with Pharma.Aero, which fosters collaboration between airport communities that have achieved IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV Pharma) certification. Both HKIA and Brussels Airport have attained CEIV Pharma. A statement from HKIA said that the initiative aims to "pioneer service offerings and standards that provide assurance in handling quality of the temperature-sensitive pharma products". Added the statement: "Shippers will be assured of seamless A2A temperature-controlled handling and provided with handling information, hence assuring the integrity of the shipments. In collaboration with Pharma.Aero and with the participation of pharma shippers, key performance indicators will be defined, targeting to set A2A pharma handling standards." Alaina Shum, general manager for aviation logistics at Airport Authority Hong Kong, said: "We are pleased to collaborate with Brussels Airport, Europe's key air cargo hub for handling pharmaceutical shipments, to establish this A2A pharma corridor. "It marks another milestone in our continuous endeavours to make HKIA a preferred pharmaceutical transshipment hub and to strengthen our status as the world's busiest cargo airport. Shum continued: "Moreover, to ensure airport-wide seamless temperature-controlled handling, we are taking delivery of 19 additional cool dollies for common-use by the airlines, meaning that all airlines will always have the option to deploy cool dollies for their temperature-sensitive shipments. We are also building apron shelters to protect the pharmaceutical shipments from direct weather elements." Steven Polmans, head of cargo and logistics for Brussels Airport, said: "Our aim is to grow the volume of pharmaceutical shipments at Brussels Airport by focusing on quality and transparency. "From the beginning, we have reached out to shippers and manufacturers to understand their requirements and work with them and the rest of our cargo community. We have been focusing on improving processes, finding innovative solutions and effectively implementing various projects. "With Pharma.Aero, our focus has expanded to cover end-to-end and lane solutions. This cooperation with HKIA for a dedicated pharma lane is a first but important step in creating specialised, dedicated pharma corridors. Our pharma volumes between Brussels and Hong Kong as well as the rest of Asia and Australia are significant, so this improved solution for our customers is being welcomed by the market very much." Frank Van Gelder, secretary general of Pharma.Aero, said: "We have received great support from our members including pharmaceuticals companies MSD and Pfizer to participate in this pharma corridor project. Their participation will help to validate the services and key performance indices of the A2A pharma corridor, making sure it provides all pharmaceuticals shippers the genuine value and peace of mind. Van Gelder indicated that the Hong Kong initiative will be introduced at other Pharma.Aero member airports, to form a network of pharma corridors.</p>

      <p>Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) will invest in a state-of-the-art pharma facility at Copenhagen Airport, covering an area of 1,500 square metres.</p>
      <p>Construction will begin in April, and the new building will provide end-to-end handling in a temperature-controlled environment for 2-8C pharma products incorporating acceptance, offload, pre-storage, build-up and storage.</p>
      <p>Accessible through four dedicated cargo doors, the facility will accept loose shipments and pre-built units, offering a storage area large enough for 300 Euro pallets and 30 PMC pallets.</p>
      <p>WFS expects the construction process to be completed in time for the new building to undergo IATA CEIV Pharma pre-assessment in July.</p>
      <p>The cargo handling agent is also upgrading the existing temperature control areas in its facility in Copenhagen to handle growing volumes of pharma products requiring 15-25C, making this the second investment in pharma facilities in under two years.</p>
      <p>Since opening the first stage of its pharma infrastructure in Copenhagen at the end of 2017, a temperature-controlled ULD storage area with the capacity to handle 16 units, WFS has seen its volumes of pharma shipments grow by 90%.</p>
      <p>John Batten, EVP cargo for Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia at WFS says: "This new investment in Copenhagen reflects our continued commitment to support airport cargo communities with growing pharma volumes."</p>
      <p>Jimi Daniel Hansen, general manager Scandinavia at WFS adds: "There is already a fast-growing demand for high quality handling of pharma shipments at Copenhagen Airport. Our commitment to significantly increase our facilities will provide the capacity for future growth and establish Copenhagen as a world class airport for pharma cargoes."</p>

      <p>Finnair Cargo has introduced Cargo Eye, an airfreight monitoring tool, and invited other innovators to pitch for solutions to the air cargo industry's remaining "unsolved challenges". Finnair says that its Cargo Eye solution integrates multiple data sources, transaction data and sensors to help its newly formed Cargo Control Center  to monitor and steer cargo flows. The carrier adds that its Cargo Eye solution provides end-to-end visibility and will ultimately lead to more comprehensive and  transparent real-time information for customers, helping them to, identify exceptions that require action to be taken. "Cargo Eye is a new operations monitoring and tracking platform that presents live, relevant and contextual data in a simple, graphical view," explained Kari Saarikoski, Digital Transformation Lead for Finnair Cargo. Cargo Eye collects live data from across all of Finnair Cargo's information and tracking systems – the global position of aircraft, flight information, the geographic location of all cargo ground traffic and key data from the SkyChain – and renders it onto a large screen in Google Maps format.   The viewer gets an instant top-level, panoramic view of what is happening and where everything is. A navigational sidebar is included, allowing the user to filter onto the screen that data which is most relevant and contextually meaningful to them. "We see Cargo Eye as an indispensable management tool," continued Saarikoski.   "For example, the CCC (Cargo Control Center) in the COOL cargo terminal can look at one screen and see where every truck and plane is carrying seafood or pharmaceuticals, get updated on its arrival and connecting transport, monitor its contents and temperature, and be prepared to shift ground resources to where they are needed most in anticipation of delivery." The tool has been created  in partnership with Qoco Systems and feeds data into Finnair's SkyChain,cargo management system, its Sensire system that monitors the location, temperature and humidity of shipments through sensors,  and the KaltIot ground transport vehicle location and shipment  temperature monitoring system. Cargo Eye was presented in Helsinki at the Slush event for start-ups across all industries. Finnair Cargo's managing director, Janne Tarvainen, observed: "We are happy to present Cargo Eye at Slush, and invite start-ups to innovate with us for improved productivity and establishing fully transparent E2E value chains for proactive cargo network steering." https://www.finnair.com/pitchforfuture/cargo </p>

      <p>With aim to offer optimal resource planning and enhanced passenger convenience, Siemens has offered digitalization of airport operations with a comprehensive portfolio of cloud-based software solutions.</p>
      <p>"Our modular applications are contributing decisively to constantly improve processes and cut costs," said Michael Reichle, CEO, Siemens Postal, Parcel &amp; Airport Logistics (SPPAL).</p>
      <p>"We always focus on palpably enhancing the convenience of passengers," he added.</p>
      <p>The solutions are based on MindSphere, which is Siemens' own cloud-based operating system for the Internet of things (IoT), which serves customers in the airport sector, as well as industrial firms, and railway operators.</p>
      <p>MindSphere collects, records and analyses the quantum of data generated daily by systems and processes. Subsequently, the data is structured for the onward use of this information.</p>
      <p>Siemens' digital solutions support airports and airlines to strengthen their competitive edge. Customers can benefit significantly in terms of efficiency, transparency and plannability.</p>
      <p>The Analytics Starter Kit from Siemens, enables airport operators and ground handlers to quickly and easily acquaint themselves with the possibilities offered by data acquisition and evaluation.</p>
      <p>The kit includes state-of-the-art Bluetooth sensors, which can be affix to the system. The kit is based on the plug-and-play principles. The so-called beacons transmit the captured data to the MindSphere. Various analysis take place in line with the need of various customers, such as vibration or temperature analysis. The measured data enable engineers to forecast failures or outages, and initiate appropriate maintenance action.</p>
      <p>Siemens offers its customers offers an easy-to-install app that's simple to use. The application presents analysis results in easily understandable displays.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the Planning, Prediction &amp; Control (PPC) software is to enable early and reliable forecasting of potential shortages or bottlenecks, which allows to optimally plan personnel, and plant resources.</p>
      <p>MindSphere enables transparent, clearly understandable presentation of baggage data, as well as intelligent linking of data, by means of machine learning. This offers significant advantages for air travelers, as passenger convenience is greatly improved by shorter waits at baggage reclaims.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the root causes of baggage loss in accordance to the Resolution 753 of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), can be identified and effectively combatted.</p>
      <p>For the visualisation of any data analysis, SPPAL offers an in-house dashboard solution that is already used at major international airports, such as Los Angeles and Dubai.</p>
      <p>The dashboard runs on all devices with Internet access, such as laptops, tablet PCs and smartphones. It provides onsite operational crews with valuable support, thereby enabling them to make better decisions more quickly, in real time.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, Siemens gladly assumes charge of servicing baggage handling systems. These efforts focus on condition-based, predictive maintenance that also makes use of beacon sensors as well as remote monitoring and analysis techniques.</p>
      <p>Currently, countless complex process steps are needed to get aircraft loaded with passengers, baggage and cargo airborne, and to their intended destinations.</p>
      <p>Several stakeholders are involved, from the airlines, airport operating companies, baggage handling system operators, and ground staff to the various administrative authorities concerned. The aviation industry is characterised by a wide range of different systems, regulations and standards.</p>
      <p>Additionally, value-creation in the industry is changing rapidly. Transporting passengers and cargo is often not enough to sustain a profitable business. This is why airports and airlines are working to tap into more business segments by adding new services for passengers.</p>

      <p>A new platform that claims to allow freight forwarders, airlines, and ground handlers to get hands-free visibility of cargo and automate their warehouse operations has been launched.</p>
      <p>The Cargocast platform tracks each cargo piece using RFID, pinpointing cargo in a warehouse within 2 ft radius.</p>
      <p>"Using this location data, processes that previously required human interaction, such as goods acceptance, can be fully automated—which helps prevent errors and increase efficiency," the company said.</p>
      <p>Cargocast is backed by Tiger Global and its clients include a "leading European ground handler and a top-five freight forwarder".</p>
      <p>Cargocast chief executive, Dan Diephouse, commented: "We've developed proprietary processes and technology that leverage the latest advances in RFID to achieve levels of accuracy that were never before possible."</p>
      <p>Diephouse is joined at the company by Mike Morey, an industry veteran and former director of cargo for Air Canada.</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows that real-time, piece-level tracking is the future, but very few companies have been able to get there without a massive rip and replacement of their existing systems and processes," said Morey.</p>
      <p>Added Diephouse: "Digitisation of cargo operations is non-optional if logistics providers want to meet the quality and speed needs of today's shippers."</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has handled the world's first electronic Dangerous Goods Declaration (eDGD) shipment using Dakosy's INFr8 shipping portal. A shipment from healthcare company Abbott based in Wiesbaden was flown on board cargo flight LH8222 from Frankfurt to Mexico City last Thursday. Lufthansa said that the dangerous goods process has traditionally been paper-based due to the lack of digital standards. Dangerous Goods Declarations on paper from shippers arrive at the airport with the respective goods and airlines can begin checking the documentation only after handover. Thanks to the new electronic system, errors in accompanying documentation can be detected and corrected out before the airline ever receives the shipment. This will translate into fewer rejected shipments in the future. It will also mean faster processes and better use of resources, Lufthansa said. Lufthansa Cargo worked closely with IATA to establish a global eDGD standard as part of IATA's e-freight initiative. "A completely new approach has been developed and evaluated through close collaboration all along the transport chain with the Infr8 eDGD platform," the airline said. Lufthansa Cargo's IT systems and processes can now deal with paperless dangerous goods shipments, making the airline the first and so far only airline to support the eDGD standard. "We are pleased that the eDGD has celebrated its global launch with Lufthansa Cargo. This underscores our claim to be the industry pioneer in digitisation. There is still so much more for us to achieve here together with shippers, forwarders and airports," said Sören Stark, board member operations and chief operating officer of Lufthansa Cargo. Hand in hand with this, the pilot phase of the INFr8 shipping portal has been successfully launched. All pilot partners are digitally connected to the platform and can use it to process transport documents – including the Dangerous Goods Declaration (DGD) required by law. Besides Lufthansa Cargo, forwarder Panalpina has also been a key partner to Dakosy.  Frankfurt Airport plays a major role in dangerous goods handling for both companies. Fraport also  responsible for providing and operating the airport's infrastructure, has contributed significantly to the development of the portal. "Thanks to this worldwide innovation, the INFr8 platform integrates the shipper into the electronic information chain of the air cargo process for the first time. We expect this to result in shorter check-in times and much faster handling of dangerous goods", said Anke Giesen, executive director operations at Fraport. The pilot phase of the INFr8 platform is expected to last six months. After this, the platform will become a standard tool available to all market participants interested in using it. There are already plans to expand the portal through the addition of further product groups. Click here for a free digital subscription Read more airfreight digitisation news</p>

      <p>DHL Express has launched a service for healthcare industry shippers operating along the Latin America- U.S. trade lane called "DHL Medical Express Service" or "WMX," which it describes as "a new market alternative to the commercial carriers that have historically served the region," with the goal of addressing delays at Brazilian airports.</p>
      <p>The offering will accommodate different temperature requirements – frozen, chilled or ambient – for medical cargo, such as laboratory kits, medical devices, biological samples, vaccines and drugs – between "several major cities in Brazil to most U.S. destinations." DHL Express said WMX shipments will be completed within a period of 24 to 48 hours along all of its offered routes.</p>
      <p>WMX also incorporates digital communications to help shrink lead times. Customers can book temperature-controlled packaging via an online interface – a task which is often left to forwarders to arrange for shippers.</p>
