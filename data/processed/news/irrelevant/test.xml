      <p>Digitisation of the supply chain was a common thread throughout the recent Air Cargo Conference held in Frankfurt. The event, hosted by Air Cargo Community Frankfurt, the Fraunhofer Institut für Materialfluss und Logistik, the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences (FUAS)and the Hochschule RheinMain, brought together scientists and members of the airfreight industry to exchange ideas and find innovative ways to take the industry forward – together. "Scientific research projects show that digitisation works. Company founders bring a breath of fresh air," said FUAS professor Kai-Oliver Schocke. The conference included presentations from several start-ups, with concepts ranging from a new airfreight booking platform to analysis of work processes to drone technology. Traditional players also showcased their own projects; examples include the development of cross-border e-commerce shipments, the introduction of a ramp control system at Frankfurt Cargo City Süd and the use of autonomous cargo trailers. Schocke noted that digitisation is "becoming tangible" for companies, and highlighted the importance of keeping employees informed, up to date with training and involved in the process of change in order for it to be successful. "We need more courage to digitise, but for that we need to get our colleagues involved early on," agreed Joachim von Winning, managing director of Air Cargo Community Frankfurt, underlining the need for common concepts across the industry to facilitate progress.

    <content>
      <p>Boeing won a major freighter order from Turkish Airlines for three 777 Freighters as the flag carrier of Turkey continues to soar on record financial results and double-digit passenger and cargo growth.</p>
      <p>Based on the 777-200LR (Longer Range), the 777 Freighter can fly 4,900 nautical miles (9,070 kilometers) with a full payload of 112 tons (102 metric tonnes or 102,000 kg). The long range means fewer stops and associated landing fees, less congestion at transfer hubs, lower cargo handling costs and shorter delivery times.</p>
      <p>"The additional aircraft will provide us more flexibility to serve even more destinations as we continue to grow our global freight network," said M. Ilker Ayc?, Turkish Airlines chairman of the Board and the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p>The new order comes days after Turkish Airlines posted record profits for the first nine months of 2018 on strong passenger and cargo demand. The carrier's air freight business saw a 25-percent tonnage increase and a 29-percent revenue increase compared to the same period a year ago. The results extend the airline's success in recent years as Turkey has become one of the largest and fastest-growing aviation markets.</p>
      <p>In line with the rapid growth, Turkish Airlines has steadily expanded its current and future fleet. Last January, the carrier announced the order of three 777 Freighters. Two months later, Turkish finalized an order for 25 787-9 Dreamliners and five options to prepare for growing demand at Istanbul's third airport, named "Istanbul Airport" by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an during its official opening last month. Over the past few months, Turkish has begun taking delivery of new 737 MAX airplanes to refresh its single-aisle jets. In all, the airline's fleet of Boeing jetliners has grown to more than 160, with nearly 100 additional jets on order.</p>
      <p>With more than 30 777s in its fleet, Turkish Airlines is among the top 10 operators of the wide-body jet in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, Boeing has launched a strategic partnership programme in Turkey last year, called the National Aerospace Initiative. Aligned with the targets of Turkey's Vision 2023 that set for the 100th anniversary of Turkish Republic's foundation, the initiative lays out a strategic collaboration framework in four key areas: industrial development, technology acceleration, services collaboration and advanced-skill training.</p>
      <p>In line with these goals, Boeing is planning to open an engineering center in Istanbul that would specialize in research and support Turkey's growing aerospace capability. The company also recently expanded its collaboration with Turkish Technic, the maintenance arm of Turkish Airlines. Under the agreement, Turkish Technic becomes a strategic supplier for Boeing's Global Fleet Care programme, providing operators with line maintenance, heavy maintenance, component service and repair for multiple aircraft models. Additionally, Boeing and Turkish Technic will partner to train and certify aircraft technicians.</p>

      <p>Ground handler dnata has signed up to use Siemens Postal, Parcel &amp; Airport Logistics' (SPPAL) software platform for its operations in Dubai. The appointment system will allow all land transport processes up to the hub's dock side to be handled digitally. "The benefits for dnata will include significantly increased transparency and the seamless, IT-based cooperation with freight forwarders, agents and airlines," SPPAL said. Last year, dnata contracted SPPAL to upgrade the automation inside the terminal with its Cargo Compact software.  Siemens has built and expanded the baggage and air cargo systems at both Dubai International Airport and the new Al Maktoum International Airport. In addition, the company is a long-term partner for the related services and software applications. </p>
      <p>Bernd Struck, senior vice president UAE Cargo &amp; DWC airline services, dnata, said: "With end-to-end digitalisation of our processes we are able to tailor our services even more closely to our customer's requirements and further increase our competitiveness." </p>

      <p>GMR Hyderabad Airport Cargo launched its "Hyderabad Cargo Charter Circle (HC3)" handling program on Oct. 11, Hyderabad International Airport (HYD) operator GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd. (GHIAL) announced yesterday. The program is intended to boost cargo charter operations out of Hyderabad Air Cargo Terminal in support of GHIAL's aims to develop HYD into a South Asian cargo hub.</p>
      <p>HC3 is a membership-based program, under which members receive various benefits, such as additional free cargo storage, priority storage allocation, a single point of contact for all aspects related to cargo handling, end-to-end logistics support within the terminal and 24/7 customer support. These benefits increase the reliability and control customers have over their cargo transiting through the airport, according to GHIAL. Ultimately, the program is meant to grow the number of direct regional and international flight connections out of HYD in support of its goal to become a hub for charter airfreight operations.</p>
      <p>"Cargo charters in India as a concept are still in a nascent phase," said SGK Kishore, GHIAL CEO. "[Cargo charters] contribute a small proportion of the volume handled by the Indian airports currently, but as an emerging market, [they] hold a lot of promise. Realizing this potential, we have launched the HC3 platform, which will act as an industry forum led by Hyderabad Airport to give the value-added advantage to this segment of the industry and help boost trade and logistics."</p>
      <p>Recently, the airport has experienced growing demand for cargo charters to support shipments including pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, telecommunications equipment and defense and aerospace commodities, GHIAL said. The new program will support this demand.</p>

      <p>Alha Group has won a long-term contract to provide ramps services for Cathay Pacific all-cargo aircraft at Milan Malpensa airport. The handler said it had rapidly assembled a ground support equipment fleet to meet the strict operational requirements of the carrier, which operates with very tight turnarounds and a very high load factor, especially for outbound flights. Alha has also created a dedicated team of qualified ramp specialists. Chief executive Lorenzo Schettini Gherardini said: "We decided to enrich our organisation with a new team dedicated to ramp services, consisting of 12 highly trained operators qualified, experienced and capable of fully responding to our business standards in terms of competence, motivation and reliability." He added that the head hunting process took place at the same time as the tender. Alha said that Cathay Pacific's decision to choose a single supplier for ramp and warehouse services would create a single operational flow from truck unloading to aircraft take-off. Cargo requiring special handling, especially perishable and pharmaceutical products, would benefit from dedicated procedures from acceptance to loading and very short transit times between warehouse and aircraft. Cathay Pacific cargo manager Italy, Alberto Brandi, said: "While coming from a positive experience with our previous ramp handler, we have decided to adopt a single operator for warehouse and ramp handling services; a natural choice for those who, like us, operate with all-cargo aircraft. "The entire handling process for goods flying on board our freighters is now fully managed by Alha's operational structure, in constant contact and coordination with our supervisors; this allows us to work more efficiently and to provide our customers with the most attractive last acceptance times for express, perishable and pharmaceutical products." He said the carrier had in the first weeks of the collaboration already enjoyed streamlined processes and reduced handling times.</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo, the freight operation of German's flag-carrier, has launched its new offering for individual customers sending large goods by air. The myAirCargo service can be booked online, is door-to-door and includes all customs formalities being taken care of by the carrier. It is expected to be particularly useful for sporting equipment or for bulky valuables such as antiques. Peter Gerber, chief executive of Lufthansa Cargo, said that the new offering allows individuals to "benefit directly from our many years of air cargo experience. By doing so, we are occupying an innovative niche in the market between postal services and forwarders. "Book air cargo quickly and easily online, at first hand – only we can do that", he added. myAirCargo is available now between most European countries and the US, while Lufthansa Cargo expects to roll out the product to other markets in coming months. myAirCargo is not the only new service Lufthansa Cargo is rolling out. Last month (July), the freight carrier announced that it will begin offering a new low-cost way of moving cargo from September this year. td.Basic will be a price-sensitive alternative for those customers happy to accept a shipment time of three days more (on average) than Lufthansa Cargo's traditional td.Pro standard product. Users of td.Basic will have to book online, with cost savings on the new product said by the airline to be derived from "simpler background processes".</p>

      <p>Aerospace logistics provider B&amp;H Worldwide has extended its aircraft on the ground (AOG) service to cover its entire global operation. B&amp;H's AOG service is operated from its Heathrow 24/7 Critical Logistics Centre – a permanently staffed single point of contact for all customers needing expert critical logistics assistance to help get grounded aircraft back into the air. B&amp;H's Group chief executive Stuart Allen said: "When a customer calls us at 3am to ask for logistics help with a grounded aircraft they get straight through to one of our highly trained AOG team who can discuss their needs knowledgably and efficiently. "We immediately spring into action and start working on resolving their issue, thereby minimising the impact of an aircraft on the ground and at the same time saving precious time and money." "Too many freight forwarders make claims about their capabilities in this field which are not backed up by the reality."</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo is to begin offering a new product for the shipping of general air cargo from September this year. To be called td.Basic and only available via online booking, the German freight-carrier said that it will offer "high Lufthansa quality at extremely attractive prices". Those 'attractive prices' will be made possible by simpler behind-the-scenes processes and by the product only being available as a booking via the internet However, it will also entail slightly longer shipping times. td.Basic will be used for any shipments for which the customer is happy to accept a transit time of three days more than that of Lufthansa Cargo's estabilshed td.Pro product. Those clients who require the faster transit time can continue to use td.Pro, while for those wanting even faster shipment there is also Lufthansa Cargo's td.Flash option for express shipping. "We are now adding a price offensive to our long-standing quality offensive," stated Alexis von Hoensbroech, board member product and sales at Lufthansa Cargo "Our customers will be able to benefit from Lufthansa quality with particularly price-sensitive cargo as well from September. With this innovative basic offering, we are enhancing our product range and charting a path for growth in the standard cargo segment. "Our new online offering underscores that Lufthansa Cargo remains a forerunner when it comes to developing innovative products," von Hoensbroech added. He noted that Lufthansa Cargo customers will have "even greater influence over the speed and price of our transport services". Development of the new td.Basic product forms part of the carrier's CARGO eVOLUTION strategy, with which Lufthansa Cargo aims to further increase paper-free operations and become "the number one in the world for air cargo services", amongst other objectives. </p>

      <p>Amerijet has approved Starcom Systems Kylos Air GPS tracking device for air cargo use aboard on its freighter aircraft.</p>
      <p>The carrier says it made the move after identifying the need for the latest in tracking technology to better serve its shipping clientele.</p>
      <p>Starcom Systems Americas designs and manufactures a variety of GPS-based tracking devices that are battery operated or direct wire applications for vehicles.</p>
      <p>Amerijet senior vice president of business development, Pamela Rollins says: "Being able to know exactly where cargo is, and being able to track or monitor it on your smartphone, desktop or via your own tracking platform is critical to the next generation of services we intend to provide."</p>
      <p>Rollins adds: "Starcom Systems latest development with the Kylos Air allows for close monitoring of high value air cargo, temperature sensitive products and equipment. The units go into 'Airplane Mode' while in the air, but communicate the moment they exit the aircraft, helping minimise the ramp time of sensitive cargo."</p>
      <p>Starcom Systems chief operating officer, Doron Kedem says: "Amerijet's approval sets the stage for our Americas subsidiary to participate in industries such as pharmaceutical, high value and electronics, which require constant monitoring."</p>

      <p>Shippers and forwarders are set to benefit from the digitisation that is creeping into the air freight industry. The latest move comes from AirBridgeCargo (ABC), which has said it is set to use Unilode's Internet of Things-connected ULDs.</p>
      <p>The carrier has extended its partnership with Unilode to include usage of Transmitting Portable Electronic Devices (TPEDs) within the ULDs, which track and sense via Bluetooth.</p>
      <p>The devices are mounted into the ULDs, and enable the carrier to track the ULDs, and measure the environmental parameters. They can register temperature, humidity, light and shock. It also gives the carrier accurate information about the cargo's status and location, on the ground or in the air.</p>
      <p>The companies are working on rolling this out, with Bluetooth readers to be installed at warehouses and ground handling facilities.</p>
      <p>Cathay Pacific trialled the devices earlier this year, and is also undergoing a roll out of the devices. Cargolux and Air Canada are also taking part. Unilode has partnered with On Asset Intelligence to provide technological support.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted to see our partnership with Unilode progressing and embracing new areas, such as IoT, which will not only facilitate data accuracy but also enhance digital customer experience with the provision of detailed information for each and every shipment," said Sergey Lazarev, general director, ABC.</p>
      <p>"This is especially important for special cargo – pharmaceutical products, oversize and heavy goods, live animals, etc. With the penetration of digitalization taking place in the air cargo sector, we want to make sure that our customers get the full benefit of it, be it general cargo, abc pharma, abc XL or other specialist dedicated services."</p>
      <p>In preparation, ABC has upgraded its online track and trace tool, introduced 24/7 Control Tower to monitor status of special cargo shipments, and reinforced its team.</p>
      <p>Benoît Dumont, Unilode CEO, added: "The BLE v.5.0 device is the most cost-effective solution for the transmission of shipment parameters with its primary benefits being improved speed and greater range."</p>
      <p>ABC is not the only airline breaking ground this week. Lufthansa Cargo has developed an online application for dangerous goods declarations (DGD).</p>
      <p>It can be used for air, road or sea, and Lufthansa claims to be the first airline to develop it. Siemens Healthcare has been one of the first adopters, and said that the application "fits seamlessly" into its digitisation strategy.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa said that DGD.online can be used to generate electronically signed dangerous goods declarations and send them automatically, complete with attachments such as safety data sheets.</p>
      <p>"Forwarders and other logistics providers can also be digitally integrated into the handling process, facilitating paperless cooperation. DGD.online is equipped for future use of eDGD. The integrated validation and convenience features can help accelerate processes and prevent costly errors," the carrier said in a statement.</p>

The five-year renewable agreement will also leverage CHEP's pooling system with the cross-utilisation of pallet assets with existing customers, including AirBridgeCargo, Air Canada and Cargolux. Cathay Pacific director cargo, James Woodrow, said: "Our teams have gone through a thorough review of the different possible ways to optimise the management of our ULD fleet. "CHEP have demonstrated their capability to meet our operational requirements. They have offered a tailor-made solution enabling Cathay Pacific to achieve substantial benefits. We also expect efficiency gains in our operations, as well as quickly modernising our fleet of ULDs."

      <p>Three major global freight forwarders have joined forces with IATA and its air cargo rates distribution platform, IATA Net Rates.</p>
      <p>The platform has been developed by the industry for the industry, to not only serve the airlines and GSAs to streamline the distribution of cargo rates but also by freight forwarders to access a one-stop-shop for their rates needs.</p>
      <p>DB Schenker, Agility Logistics and Hellmann Worldwide Logistics have joined forces with IATA to use the platform.</p>
      <p>During the last World Cargo Symposium, IATA Net Rates announced that Qatar Airways had joined the platform as the official launch carrier, and is actively working with global and regional airlines to join the programme.</p>
      <p>Glyn Hughes, global head of cargo at IATA says: "IATA is very pleased to be working with such an important and growing list of major freight forwarders. Electronic tariff distribution is one important component of modernising the entire distribution function."</p>
      <p>IATA Net Rates works closely with key industry groups for the development of API standards and the integration of the platform with other IATA standards such as One Record and Cargo XML.</p>
      <p>Sven Heinemann, head of global data and contract management air/ocean at DB Schenker says: "The IATA Net Rates Tool is an enabler to make our carrier rates fully automatic available in our Schenker's internal rate management systems. This will reduce manual effort and increase volume and data quality tremendously. We need all major airlines to participate in the programme to enable fully automated end-to-end connectivity."</p>
      <p>Frederic Leger, director airport, passenger, cargo and security products at IATA says: "IATA Net Rates fits perfectly within the vision and mission of IATA to develop standards, remove the paper with technology that brings efficiency to the industry and engage with all parties to join. IATA Net Rates is a neutral platform run by the air transport association for the benefits of the industry."</p>

      <p>Kerry Logistics will offer customers the option of using a 'smart sensor' within their supply chain, which enables total supply chain visibility and improved security.</p>
      <p>The logistics firm said the smart sensor monitors cargo across ocean, air, and ground transportation around-the-clock and is accepted in over 190 countries. Both consignees and shippers are able to obtain first-hand information about the physical environment of the cargo through constant personalised alerts or via the KerrierVISION visibility portal.</p>
      <p>The sensor can "transmit seamless data on location and environmental variables including temperature, pressure, tilt, shock, humidity, and pilferage to multiple stakeholders along the supply chain", Kerry said.</p>
      <p>"End-to-end visibility has become a prerequisite to the agility to any supply chain," Mathieu Biron, managing director – Global Freight Forwarding of Kerry Logistics, said. "Global supply chains are increasingly complex. Our adoption of smart sensor provides international customers with greater visibility and control, thus improving the quality of their operations, exception management, and demand planning. And do so at lower operating costs."</p>
      <p>The sensors will be particularly useful for time and environmental-sensitive shipments such as in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. "It also adds huge value to premium goods including high value consumer electronic products," the logistics firm explained.</p>
      <p>"With the adaptive smart sensor solution, our customers can make immediate decisions at any stage across the supply chain based on actionable intelligence, which enables them to minimise loss and enhance efficiency. We anticipate the sensor-based logistics solution becoming an indispensable part of the supply chain with the increasing adoption of IoT in the global logistics practices," Biron added.</p>

The cargo division of Swiss said it had designed the new website after holding months of seminars with customers around the world to understand their needs and to create an "engaging user experience". </p>
      <p>"Apart from enhanced and renewed content that better reflects the business strategy of Swiss WorldCargo, a social media feed and an improved track and trace feature have been implemented," the carrier said. "The website provides enhanced transparency and more actual information regarding the shipment status to Swiss WorldCargo's customers which results in an improved customer service. "Further, a new route finder offers enhanced timetable functionality with a wider display of routing options and pharma capability information for each routing."

      <p>DHL Global Forwarding is to assist start-up entrepreneurs in logistics and supply chain development with the launch of DHL Start-Up Helpdesk.</p>
      <p>The helpdesk will help young companies enter the international business market and provide advice on what requirements need to be met if products and goods are to be offered in other countries, including outside the European Union.</p>
      <p>It will help with customs and shipping advice such as asking if the goods have been packaged properly, what transport mode is best, customs requirements for imports and exports, what shipping documents are required and whether the goods have been properly insured.</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding vice president for customer service in Germany, Joachim Hermansky says: "Our customer base of start-ups with global operations is growing rapidly at our branch in Berlin. Understandably, they have a greater need for advice and services, particularly in the initial stages.</p>
      <p>"That is precisely why we trained up a young team that acts as a link between companies going global and traditional handling departments. They understand both worlds and that allows them to provide swift and flexible support."</p>

Our solution enables the end-to-end management of Mubadala's supply chain creating visibility across all assets in scope."</p>
      <p>Mubadala aerospace &amp; engineering services CEO, Homaid Al Shimmari says: "As Abu Dhabi's aerospace cluster develops at the Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park, with new companies being established with our global OEM partners as well as the expansion of our current businesses, a robust supply chain supported by DHL, will be an essential part of future success."</p>
      <p>About 66 per cent of cargo transported in the course of the five year partnership will be airfreight and is designed to optimise logistics, speed of change and cost reductions to all assets and customers across the globe.</p>

      <p>Following on from their partnership in the Austrian market announced in March, Deutsche Post DHL Group and Austrian Post will also collaborate on last-mile parcel delivery in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, starting in September 2019.</p>
      <p>In Time (a subsidiary of Austrian Post) will deliver parcels sent by DHL customers to Slovakia, while DHL subsidiary PPL CZ will do the same for Austrian Post customers sending packages to the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>"After the collaboration with Austrian Post in Austria both parties decided to further use each other's delivery network as described in Slovakia and the Czech Republic," said Petr Horak, managing director PPL CZ and DHL Parcel Slovensko. </p>
      <p>"With e-commerce on the rise and growing parcel volumes, high-quality and best-in-class customer experience in last-mile-delivery becomes increasingly a key differentiator and with this cooperation we will lay the right foundation for this."</p>
