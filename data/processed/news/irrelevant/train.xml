      <p>Liege Airport has forged three important partnership agreements with Orange Belgium, Alibaba Cloud and Qatar Airways on the sidelines of the WeCargo event, which brought together start-ups, air cargo industrialists and investors.</p>
      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo will extend its contract with Liege Airport and grow its operations. For Guillaume Halleux, Chief Officer of Cargo Qatar Airways, the Liege Airport hub is an important asset in his company's network, "We are very satisfied with the services received at Liege and its logistic connections with the major European cities. Liege Airport is a guarantee of future growth and we are happy to contribute to the increase of jobs in the Liege region."</p>
      <p>Another deal was signed with Alibaba Cloud, the technology subsidiary of Alibaba, which has a successful AI platform and which "has the skills and experience needed to transform, digitise and support our airport's operations and handling procedures," read the official statement.</p>
      <p>Finally, a partnership agreement to develop the internet of things and smart services was signed with Orange Belgium. Under the terms of this deal, Orange Belgium and Liege Airport will select together which cargo activities to study and for which technological solutions will be implemented. These case studies will serve the operators and businesses working at the airport.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted to work with Liege Airport in developing innovative solutions. The logistics sector presents many opportunities to make the most of our technological expertise concerning connected objects or track &amp; trace solutions. We also welcome the possibility to help develop this economic activity hub, which is so important for the Liege region," said MichaÃ«l Trabbia, CEO of Orange Belgium.</p>
      <p>Speaking about these partnerships, Luc Partoune, CEO of Liege Airport, said, "If we want to stay at the cutting edge and continue to grow as a cargo-only airport, we must energise our ecosystem. This was the main goal of WeCargo: to energise and inspire the international cargo community. This goal was met and we are already preparing the next WeCargo event. The partnership agreements with Alibaba Cloud and Orange Belgium covering digital matters, as well as the extension and growth of Qatar Airways on the site, are leading the airport towards excellence."</p>

      <p>MASkargo will use cloud-based Unisys logistics solutions' Digi-IQ and Digi-Portal to provide "complete visibility" in the cargo shipment lifecycle. The cargo division of Malaysia Airlines is the largest cargo ground handling agent in Malaysia and handles more than 30 customer airlines at its Advanced Cargo Centre, processing more than 800,000 air waybills per year. Ibrahim Mohamed Salleh, chief executive of MASkargo, said: "Kuala Lumpur is a vital and growing cargo transit hub for Asia. Using Unisys Digi-Portal we will be able to reach an even wider market of forwarders and shippers with an easy-to-use and secure online booking tool. "Digi-IQ will provide us and our customers with greater visibility of their supply chain via real-time continuous monitoring of shipments tracked against key milestones. "This will also help us identify and forecast potential service disruptions and take proactive measures to address them in advance. This will help us to provide a better service and reliability for our customers." Under a five-year engagement signed in November 2018, MASkargo will join the Unisys Digi-Portal e-commerce platform to promote its inventory to a wider global community of more than 25,000 buyers at forwarders, airlines, general sales agents and handlers across more than 140+ countries. MASkargo will also use Unisys Digi-IQ to track, report and measure shipments, "meeting and exceeding the worldwide cargo industry standards set by IATA Cargo iQ," said an airlines spokesperson. MASkargo has used the core Digistics cloud-based logistics management system to manage its domestic and international cargo services since 2016. Added the spokesperson: "Digi-IQ automatically builds a route map for each shipment based on origin, destination, product, station operating hours, aircraft types and other factors. "It then uses continuous monitoring in real time to track each shipment against key route map milestones with pre-alerts, advance notifications and early exception warnings based on configuration options, alerting operators to any actual or potential delays." Andrew Whelan, vice president of commercial sector, Unisys Asia Pacific, said: "These two Digistics software-as-a-service solutions will provide MASkargo with additional agility, ability to generate new revenues and visibility to quickly take advantage of market opportunities such as quickly offering promotions via Digi-Portal to optimise air cargo capacity. "Using the Digi-IQ performance measurement system, advanced analytics will proactively identify early exception warnings so that MASkargo can take proactive measures to avoid service disruptions, to provide high service standards for its forwarder clients and the airlines it services as the Ground Handling Agent."</p>

      <p>Lufthansa Cargo has loaded the 100,000th tonne of cargo via Fraport AG's Speed Gate at Frankfurt Airport, on April 24, 2017. Lufthansa Cargo AG uses Speed Gate at CargoCity South, Europe's largest hub for global cargo logistics, since autumn 2014. Cargo is unloaded at four automated gates at the press of a button, security checked within the gates and subsequently brought directly to the aircraft.</p>
      <p>"With optional mobile add-ons, such as our 'Mobile Acceptance' and 'Customised Import' services, we are putting Speed Gate to the best possible use and offering our customers a service tailored to them at the Frankfurt hub. We collect the cargo from the customer, either loose or on pallets. As part of the cargo acceptance service, we also check the built-up pallets directly at the customer warehouse. With the import service, we offer our customers the option of having their cargo delivered directly from the aircraft to their warehouse via Speed Gate. This makes waiting times a thing of the past," said Board Member Operations SÃ¶ren Stark, before ceremoniously pressing the button to send the 100,000th tonne of cargo airside through Speed Gate.</p>
      <p>"Our customers have responded very well to both service offerings: 81 percent of the cargo units built by our customers at CargoCity South, known as BUPs, were accepted via the mobile service in the latest quarter already."</p>
      <p>When Fraport AG opened Speed Gate almost four years ago at Frankfurt airport, the infrastructure was mainly aimed at cargo handlers without airside handling facilities.</p>
      <p>"In the meantime, we created an offering of benefit to many companies. With Speed Gate, we are helping to make the hub even faster and more agile for our cargo customers. We firmly expect Speed Gate to become a more important tool for other cargo companies and their customers as well," emphasised Anke Giesen, executive director operations at Fraport AG.</p>

      <p>At the end of 2019 Brussels Airport decided to significantly expand and strengthen its cargo team. Cargo was already an import cornerstone in the strategy and development of the airport with a dedicated approach, but earlier in 2019, in line with the new business strategy in which cargo and logistics is 1 of the 4 central pillars, it was decided to centralise the entire responsibility of all activities in the cargo zone (operational, financial, commercial, real estate, â¦) within the cargo business unit. These activities will remain under the leadership of Steven Polmans, previously Head of Cargo, who at that time was appointed Director Cargo &amp; Logistics.</p>
      <p>Last months a new structure was drawn up to manage all existing and additional activities and as a result, the cargo team will be significantly expanded with new and adapted functions. In line with this, Nathan De Valck will as of beginning of this month, take up the new role of Head of Product and Network Development. He will report directly to the Director of Cargo &amp; Logistics and will be responsible with his team for all business development and key account activities for airlines, forwarders and shippers as well as the further development of the various specializations and products such as pharma, perishables, animal transport and e-commerce.</p>
      <p>In the coming months, the Cargo &amp; Logistics team will be further strengthened with, among others, a head of cargo real estate, business analyst, parc services manager and an operations manager. These reinforcements confirm the importance of cargo for the airport and the clear commitment to further develop Brussels Airport as a leading logistics platform in Europe.</p>

      <p>Kerry Logistics Network, the Asia-based service provider, has further expanded its European operations by acquiring Germany's Multi Logistics, a specialist film and media logistics provider with 30 years' experience in the sector. The expansion will add four offices and bring in additional logistics expertise to Kerry Logistics' existing resources and network in Germany. Kerry Logistics will now operate seven offices in Germany, including its regional headquarters in Frankfurt as well as Bremen, Hamburg, Munich, and Berlin, each offering international freight forwarding (ocean/air/road), warehousing and distribution, andÂ Customs brokerage. Besides its international freight forwarding operations, Multi Logistics' service portfolio includes door-to-door service, personal support service for film productions, security transport, storage of film copies, and handling of rental equipment, as well as Carnet A.T.A. preparation, and handling. Thomas Blank, managing director of Europe of Kerry Logistics, said: "The expansion is in line with our strategy to accelerate the business development of the European market." The move comes three weeks after Kerry Logistics' expansion in Spain with the takeover of the freight forwarding businesses of Bofill &amp; Arnan, a logistics and freight forwarding company with a focus on the China, Taiwan, and India trade lanes.</p>

      <p>Enabler of the digitised supply chain Nexxiot and Unilode Aviation Solutions have signed a contract to digitise the entire Unilode fleet within the next 18 months. By the beginning of 2021, all 1,25,000 ULDs supported by Unilode will be fitted with a digital twin.</p>
      <p>All Unilode Unit Load Device (ULDs) will be equipped with Bluetooth sensors, that will collect data which will then be processed, analysed and made available by Nexxiot for Unilode. This will enable continuous, automated tracking of ULDs both on the ground and in the air. Currently, around 10,000 ULDs are already equipped with the corresponding Bluetooth technology and can be activated digitally by Nexxiot.</p>
      <p>We're proud to be partner of @unilode now! Together we digitize the aviation industry &amp; enable continuous automated tracking of ULDs on the ground &amp; in the air.#iot #supplychainoptimization #aviation https://t.co/4WemHoSk4x</p>
      <p>"The strategic partnership with Unilode is an important step for us in scaling our business model. For the first time, we are now developing solutions to digitise the air freight market and make the handling of ULDs transparent worldwide. We achieve this by combining freight and movement data. Our extensive experience in the rail segment has helped us to master the problems in the air freight industry," said Helmut Kaspers, CEO, Nexxiot.</p>
      <p>Boarding ULDs digitally</p>
      <p>The first joint trials between the two companies have been running since September 2018. For the first time, Nexxiot is now working independently of its own sensors and will thus integrate external data on its platform.</p>
      <p>Welcoming the cooperation, BenoÃ®t Dumont, CEO of Unilode Aviation Solutions, said, "We are very diligent in selecting our partners and have high standards for the companies we cooperate with. After a long review, it turned out that Nexxiot is currently the only supplier worldwide with whom we can implement this kind of project in such a short time. That's why we've brought Nexxiot on board as a strategic partner and benefit from the company's vast expertise in the digitisation of large fleets."</p>
      <p>Next-gen ULDs come of age</p>
      <p>In addition to the digitisation project, Nexxiot has developed and currently maintains a neutral user interface for Unilode where customers can view the data of their ULDs and use various services such as ULD location, temperature, shock, light and humidity measurement, as well as inflight tracking. Based on the new partnership, the company will be able to offer spot leasing for load carriers in the future. Pooling of ULDs will also be simplified.</p>

      <p>Applications for membership have begun being accepted for Globalia Logistics Network, which describes itself as "an exclusive network accepting only the highest calibre freight forwarders in each key air/seaport worldwide".</p>
      <p>Globalia applicants will undergo a tough selection process including external auditing and those accepted will enjoy the first six months free. The new network was founded by Antonio Torres, who launched Conqueror Freight Network seven years ago.</p>
      <p>Torres says: "Because of the unique nature of Conqueror, the amount of interest in membership is still unprecedented and in truth, there is simply not enough room to accommodate every qualifying company, so, I felt it was right to give more agents the opportunity to enjoy the same benefits through a new network."</p>
      <p>He adds: "Some might say that what we are launching is not new, and they would be right. We are offering the same opportunities as Conqueror but for a new group of first class companies, allowing them to work with the same calibre of agents as themselves worldwide."</p>

      <p>Delhi Indira Ghandi International AirportÂ has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Amsterdam Airport Schiphol to develop an airfreight trade lane.</p>
      <p>The MoU will see both airports collaborate on and promote airfreight between them. The collaboration includes business promotion, product development, knowledge sharing, training, performance benchmarking and regulatory agency cooperation. Delhi International Airport chief executive officer, Prabhakara Rao, says: "We aim to make Indian trade much more competitive in the global market." He adds it wants to bring its operations up to global standards.</p>
      <p>Schiphol senior vice president cargo, Enno Osinga, tellsÂ Air Cargo WeekÂ Amsterdam can be a gateway for Indian goods destined for Europe, as well as the US, Africa and Latin America. "We have been focusing on India for the last five years. Our first focus was on the Mumbai area and the logical next step is Delhi, which has a large pharma production market. Delhi is the next step rather than the beginning."</p>

      <p>Kerry Logistics has introduced six robotic butlers at its flagship facility in Hong Kong to speed up the picking process in line with trends in e-commerce.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The robots operate 24/7 and can pick 280 items per hour compared to 50 items normally, and the pick rate is four times faster.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Kerry said this made ideal for retail brands which sell a wide variety of consumer products with potentially expanding e-commerce business as speed-to-market was key to their success.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Real time sales orders are transmitted from retailers and e-commerce providers to Kerry's warehouse management system and then to the robotic butlers.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The system indicates the right items to be picked for shipments using a simple lighting system in which every item is tracked via barcodes.</p>

      <p>CEVA Logistics has opened Central Distribution Center (CDC) 2 in Shah Alam, Malaysia, 16 miles from Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>Constructed on the same site as CEVA's CDC1 at Bukit Jelutong, Shah Alam, CDC2 gives itÂ 33,000 square metres of additional warehousing and office space.</p>
      <p>The combined warehouse footprint of the new CDC2 and the existing CDC1 now totals approximately 67,000 square metres making it the largest site in CEVA's South East Asia (SEA) cluster, which comprises Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
      <p>CEVA's facility at Bukit Jelutong is in a strategic industrial area with excellent logistics infrastructure, connected to a highly-developed road network and an expanding rapid transit system, and located close to Malaysia's main port in Klang.</p>
      <p>The company says having two warehouse facilities on one site enables itÂ to optimise the deployment of resources and equipment, for customers' benefit.</p>
      <p>The new, enlarged facility strengthens CEVA's capabilities to offer fully integrated logistics and supply chain solutions to new and existing customers in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>CEVA's chief executive officer, Xavier Urbain says: "Malaysia is one of our key markets in the Asia region. The country has excellent connectivity both domestically and internationally.</p>
      <p>"It is also in a region where a strong middle class is emerging to drive Asian consumption upwards, positively influencing trade and supply chain activities across various sectors. All these factors make Malaysia a strategic market for CEVA to invest in, allowing us to enhance the scope and quality of our services for customers."</p>
      <p>The new CDC2 is a double story warehouse facility with direct truck access to 40 loading docks on both levels. It is the first design of its type to be approved in Malaysia, as part of a drive to maximise the productivity of land used for warehousing space, thus catering to the growing demand for contract logistics.</p>
      <p>The facility is purpose-built, and designed to provide both ambient and temperature-controlled storage.</p>

      <p>Unilode Aviation Solutions plans to accelerate digital transformation in unit load device (ULD) management with Bluetooth tracking.</p>
      <p>The tracking solution is based on a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tag fully embedded into the structure of the ULDs, which is supported by a global interoperable reader infrastructure.</p>
      <p>To implement the programme, Unilode has teamed up with technology provider OnAsset Intelligence and a ULD manufacturer.</p>
      <p>Customers including Cathay Pacific, Air Canada, Cargolux and AirBridgeCargo are among the airlines involved in the digitisation programme, which is being rolled out this year, along with several shippers.</p>
      <p>Unilode chief executive officer (CEO), Benoit Dumont says: "Unilode Aviation Solutions has decided to accelerate the use of modern technology in its ULD management solutions. Since winning the inaugural IATA Air Cargo Innovation Award in 2015 we have been working closely with our customers to enhance our digital tracking technology with user input across the end-to-end value chain.</p>
      <p>He adds: "Unilode does not intend to lock itself, its customers and industry partners into proprietary technologies, and therefore has decided to make public all APIs necessary to capture information from our digitally enabled platforms. This approach greatly enhances interoperability and flexibility, which is what the industry and our customers are looking for."</p>
      <p>OnAsset Intelligence CEO, Adam Crossno says: "Together with Unilode we have been focusing on making sure the technology is safe, compliant, fit for purpose and technically sound. Our common vision is that this technology should be accessible for all stakeholders in the value chain, so intelligent ULDs can be leveraged by airlines, ground handlers, freight forwarders and shippers.</p>
      <p>"This is extremely important because quite often the tracking challenges arise when shipments leave their expected route and are not found where they are expected to be."</p>

      <p>Dachser has entered into a partnership with German research society the Fraunhofer Institute for Material Flow and Logistics to develop innovative solutions.</p>
      <p>ItsÂ employees will work alongside Fraunhofer researchers at the newly created Dachser Enterprise Lab in Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Dachser chief executive Bernhard Simon said collaboration with universities and other partners had "for many years been a mainstay" of the company's corporate strategy.</p>
      <p>He added: "The Dachser Enterprise Lab adds key competencies to our internal research and development capacity, and gives us flexible access to specialists.</p>
      <p>"Fraunhofer IML possesses outstanding expertise, state-of-the-art laboratories and a wide range of motivated and creative researchers.Â When coupled with the longstanding experience of Dachser's logistics experts, we believe this will further accelerate the company's rate of innovation."</p>
      <p>Director for corporate solutions, research and development Stefan Hohm said there were multiple advantages from working with academics,Â foremost of which wasÂ the ability to "flexibly boost" Dachser's access to knowledge and research and development resources.</p>
      <p>"Bringing the business knowhow of logistics experts and the scientific knowledge of Fraunhofer IML together creates a win-win situation for both partners."</p>
      <p>Describing Fraunhofer as "very much practice-oriented" in its research, he added it possesses "vast" experience in partnering with companies.</p>
      <p>Managing director of Fraunhofer Michael ten Hompel said Enterprise Labs had been set up to transfer research results over to products or business models as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>"It puts us in a position whereÂ we can flexibly and speedily put new technologies, trends, or business strategies into practice and efficiently determine our priorities."</p>
      <p>Mr Hohm told The Loadstar any developments would be specifically for use by Dachser.</p>
      <p>"The developments are meant to be specifically for across-the-board deployment in the Dachser Road Logistics and Air &amp; Sea Logistics networks."</p>
      <p>The decision to keep developments in-house contrasts with Deutsche Post-DHL's innovation centre in Bonn, which is expanding production to cater for third-party sales.</p>
      <p>This month, DHL announced it was looking to roll out 20,000 of its Street Scooter e-vehicles a year, adding an additional 78,000sq metre warehouse in Duren to meet demand.</p>

    <content>
      <p>Dutch independent third-party logistics service provider Best Global Logistics (BGL), a customer of Riege Software, has utilised the newly developed direct airline booking API (Application Programming Interface). The API is available for Air France KLM Martinair Cargo bookings, enabling seamless operations in conjunction with Riege's forwarding software Scope as an integrated solution. Providing the benefits of direct booking while at the same time avoiding the disadvantage of system changes, the direct airline booking API marks another milestone in Riege's 'One System. One Record' approach to push Scope as the digital standard in logistics.</p>
      <p>BGL was the first Riege customer to seek integration and will be the first one to use it. After the pilot period, Amsterdam-based Fast Forward Freight (FFF) will follow. Both BGL and FFF have invested in the development of the API together with Riege, which allowed the completion in the shortest period of time possible.</p>
      <p>"It was our intention to benefit from this solution, the sooner the better, but we also had the ambition to be the first ones owning this API as an early adopter as well as a driver of future- oriented technology," said Michel Loots, CEO at BGL.</p>
      <p>With the new API Scope, users can directly send a booking request to Air France KLM Martinair Cargo, then receive flights and prices in real time and book the required flight directly without separate booking via web portals or phone and always with the latest dynamic prices at hand.</p>
      <p>"Technically, it is all about a real-time match between capacity and demand. In practice, it is about saving time and money by avoiding phone calls and system changes. Literally a significant win for us and our customers which simultaneously makes us stronger in a very competitive market. The money we invested together with FFF is well spent, and the ROI is calculated for within one year," said Loots focussing the economic aspect. "You rarely find companies co-investing in technological progress these days. With partners like BGL and FFF, Riege is blessed in the best meaning of the word. Of course, it is not limited to Air France KLM Martinair Cargo. All airlines are most welcome to join this community, gaining new customers with impressive volumes of freight," said Henk Boorsma, managing director and co-owner of Riege Software in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>"I am glad and honoured to represent a company which not only can trust in the capabilities and loyalty of its employees, but also in the allegiance of its customers many of whom have proven more than once that real partnership goes beyond purely factual business relationships. That's priceless. I wish to express my thankfulness specifically to Michel Loots of BGL and Marc Terpstra of FFF. When we say that Scope is the future of digital logistics, guys like them are the driving force," said Dr. Tobias Riege, CEO of Riege Software.</p>

      <p>Independent forwarder members of the WCA network will all have free access to WIN's electronic air waybill (e-AWB) platform for the remainder of this year, delegates at the WCA's annual conference 2016 have heard. The WIN platform, designed specifically for independent cargo agents and which connects to over 90 airlines, will now allow WCA members to submit any International Air Transport Association (IATA) Resolution 672 (paperless) e-AWB free of charge, as well as to make electronic bookings and receive tracking alerts. "We are at a tipping point, with the level of e-AWB adoption in the industry approaching the halfway mark," said WIN's managing director, John DeBenedette. "Independents can act now to gain the same level of efficiencies already enjoyed by multinational forwarders and tap into the growing trend of airport fast lanes for cargo tendered with electronic data in advance." WCA's CEO, Dan March, added: "WCA takes pride in our long history as an innovative business development platform helping independent forwarders compete on a level playing field with their larger rivals. For our members, going electronic is not just about eliminating paper or helping airlines increase their efficiency which is all well and good, but equally important it's about benefiting from the real-time shipment visibility, system integration, and member collaboration features that we've also built into WIN." And Glyn Hughes, IATA's global head of cargo congratulated WCA's leadership for supporting the air cargo industry's drive to go paperless. "Air cargo needs to upgrade its value proposition as shipper expectations become ever more demanding and paper-based solutions just can't deliver the quality, transparency and predictability that is required," he declared.</p>

      <p>IBM has launched a new blockchain solution, aimed at improving supplier validation, onboarding and life cycle information management.</p>
      <p>Together with Chainyard, the firm announced the launch of Trust Your Supplier (TYS) with news that some major shippers, including GlaxoSmithKline, Lenovo, and Vodafone, have already signed up to it.</p>
      <p>Chief supply chain officer for Lenovo's Data Centre Group Renee Ure said the new platform could prove "transformative".</p>
      <p>"Blockchain has the ability to completely transform how companies onboard and manage their supplier network.Â Through TYS, both buyers and suppliers will the see the procurement benefits of blockchain through reductions in cost, complexity and speed."</p>
      <p>TYS creates a 'digital passport' for supplier identity on the blockchain network that allows suppliers to share information with any permitted buyer on the network.</p>
      <p>By using blockchain, data sharing is permission-based, which IBM said "should" help reduce the time and cost associated with qualifying, validating and managing new suppliers.</p>
      <p>"Traditional methods of managing suppliers often involve cumbersome manual processes, which make it difficult to verify identities and track," it said.Â "By using a decentralised approach and an immutable blockchain audit trail, TYS is designed to eliminate manual time-consuming processes and help reduce risks of fraud and errors."</p>
      <p>Research firm Gartner recently claimed blockchain would track $2trn worth of goods a year by 2023, with IBM keen to onboard 4,000 of its own suppliers this year.</p>
      <p>Third-party validators, such asÂ Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Ecovadis and RapidRatings provide outside verification or audit capabilities directly on the network.</p>
      <p>Vice president of procurement at Nokia, which has also signed up to TYS, Sanjay Mehta said: "This blockchain initiative represents a great opportunity for us.Â Using the latest technology to address a classical challenge will be of benefit for everyone, and further increase the speed of using innovative solutions."</p>
      <p>This is not the IT giant's first venture in supply chain blockchain technology, having jointly launched its TradeLens platform some 20 months ago with Maersk. Following a difficult start, when many questioned whether other carriers would be keen to work alongside a competitor, the platform has now got some pace behind it.</p>

      <p>Unilode Aviation Solutions, Safran and OnAsset Intelligence have completed their joint development project to develop Bluetooth digital pallet tags, for the digital enablement of aviation pallets.</p>
      <p>A statement in its official release said that its been less than a year ago that the parties collaborated to develop a unique design for a Bluetooth 5 digital tag.</p>
      <p>These tags can seamlessly be fitted into a pallet to prevent mishandling and stacking problems that may occur with bolt-on solutions positioned externally.</p>
      <p>Safran's engineering team designed a complementary corner piece solution to house the antenna of the tag in the pallet corner and the rest of OnAsset's innovative digital device will be entirely integrated inside the edge rail of the pallet, informs the ULD management solutions provider.</p>
      <p>The Switzerland-based company informs through a statement: "Unilode's new Safran pallets will be delivered with the integrated corner piece while existing units will be retrofitted to enable the provision of data on location and shock, which is important especially for time-critical cargo."</p>
      <p>The company added: "The technology has been approved for in-flight use. Unilode will start rolling out its digitally enabled ULDs along with the global reader infrastructure to set its digital transformation programme in motion."</p>

      <p>The new FAIR@Link portal, after a six-month test phase, goes into full operation for digitally-supported air cargo handling at Hamburg Airport Cargo Center.</p>
      <p>This new portal ensures more sustainability and transparency as well as faster and more efficient processes for the companies involved in air freight handling.</p>
      <p>The platform was developed by software firm DAKOSY, which also operates the Port Community System for the Port of Hamburg and the Cargo Community System for Frankfurt Airport.</p>
      <p>In addition to Hamburg Airport and DAKOSY, the pilot participants included the forwarders CROSS FREIGHT, Delta-Stallion, a.hartrodt and SABLE, the handling agents LUG and Swissport, the Hamburg Airport Customs Office and the Hamburg Forwarding Agents Association (VHSp).</p>
      <p>The pilot project started at Hamburg Airport Cargo Center on May 6, 2019.</p>
      <p>Hamburg Airport begins using DAKOSY air cargo community system</p>
      <p>All participants have already noticed clear improvements in their processes during the pilot phase.</p>
      <p>Hamburg Airport highlights the advantage of implementation of this platform. Out of many, one is that forwarders can book time slots for deliveries. This results in shorter waiting and handling times, more transparency along the transport chain and improved documentation for handling agents, who no longer need to re-enter duplicate data - thus avoiding mistakes and saving time.</p>
      <p>Hamburg Airport Cargo Center completes one year of operations</p>
      <p>Introducing this system brings in a major advantage, that is the system prepares export Customs declarations and then automatically submit the electronic forms to Customs upon entry to the Hamburg Airport Customs Office geofence area.</p>
      <p>Slot booking makes planning easier</p>
      <p>Jens Sorgenfrei, managing director of CROSS FREIGHT Internationale Speditionsges. mbH, sums up the advantages for freight forwarders: "Transports pre-registered via FAIR@Link are handled preferentially by the handling agents at the airport. The slot bookings save us several hours every day. Processes are easier to plan. All in all, we benefit in Customs and door clearances."</p>
      <p>Dr. JÃ¼rgen Vogt, managing director of LUG, also sees it as positive from the viewpoint of handling agents: "With slot booking, our EDP system receives all information before the arrival of the goods. The data does not have to be entered again when the document is received. This enables us to save a lot of time and speed up the receiving process. With FAIR@Link, we gain more transparency into all processes and can better manage our capacities with regard to door and personnel availability."</p>
      <p>Ulrich Wrage, CEO of DAKOSY said: "Through connectivity and intelligent process support, FAIR@Link can optimize the physical processes between companies and achieve significantly faster and more transparent processing. In addition, the platform promotes ecological concerns, as optimized traffic management and reduced check-in and waiting times lead to CO2 savings. And it saves paper, too."</p>

      <p>California-based freight forwarding and customs brokerage company Flexport has recently integrated Luxembourg-based CHAMP Cargosystems's messaging platformâTraxon cargoHUB as well as its new cargoJSON data-interchange format.</p>
      <p>According to reports, cargoJSON is a language-independent data format which CHAMP has defined for air cargo messaging.</p>
      <p>cargoJSON was recently added to Traxon cargoHUB, which is fully interoperable with the existing IATA cargoIMP and IATA cargoXML formats. Flexport is CHAMP's first customer to have implemented it.</p>
      <p>"CHAMP and its partners are always in a pursuit to seek innovative and effective ways to create efficiencies and drive rapid adoption of digitization in the industry," said Laurent Jossa, head of sales- distribution services of CHAMP Cargosystems.</p>
      <p>"Flexport has been agile in implementing the services and the new messaging format and CHAMP has been quick to meet this need," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are constantly seeking new partners to get better information for our clients. We are glad to find CHAMP, which offers a modern cargoJSON API that makes it easy for our team to seamlessly integrate their information into our product.," said Phoebe Rockwood, air freight product manager of Flexport.</p>
      <p>"CHAMP has made this possible with its large community reach, comprehensive solution and related services, and state-of the-art communication technology," he said.</p>

      <p>IAG Cargo has awarded its ULD repair and maintenance contract to Airbase GSE.</p>
      <p>The transition from the previous supplier was managed by IAG Cargo and Airbase GSE management teams working closely together to ensure a "seamless transition for IAG Cargo operations".</p>
      <p>Airbase GSE has repaired in excess of 30,000 ULDs for IAG Cargo since the contract started. It provides IAG Cargo customers with an average turnaround time of less than 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>The contract operates out of a 81,000 sq ft secure unit, including 6 loading docks, located under 2 miles from Heathrow Airport.</p>
      <p>Airbase GSE chief executive Nicholas Payne said: "We are really pleased with IAG Cargo's decision and are honoured to be working with and supporting at this exciting time of growth and change. We will strive to deliver the highest level of safety and industry practices while remaining scalable for IAG Cargo's future growth."</p>

      <p>PSA International and SATS have signed a memorandum of understanding to establish sea-air connectivity to promote Singapore as a key multimodal transport hub.</p>
      <p>Combining air and sea connections, the partnership strengthens Singapore's position as a global transhipment hub for air and sea cargo.</p>
      <p>The freight industry, including small and medium sized enterprises stand to benefit from improved multimodal linkages and transit systems for better supply chain efficiency, optimised transport costs, and faster delivery.</p>
      <p>The two companies will collaborate on a wide range of cross-industry initiatives, particularly in the perishables, electronics and e-commerce sectors.</p>
      <p>From yard-to-port data linkages and network extensions between both companies to enhance track-and-trace capabilities, the partnership will facilitate data transparency and ease of shipment movement within free-trade zones.</p>
      <p>SATS and PSA will also integrate their systems to aid regulatory compliance and build data analytics capabilities.</p>
      <p>COSYS+, a cargo terminal handling and management system operated by SATS will be linked with CALISTA, the global supply chain platform developed by PSA's subsidiary GeTS Asia to provide real-time updates and greater visibility for shipments.</p>
      <p>Alex Hungate, president and CEO of SATS says: "When SATS became the world's first ground handler to provide multimodal meat transhipment services between New Zealand and the EU, we demonstrated that multimodal connectivity can attract higher trade flows. Today, we hope our cross-industry initiatives with PSA will now enable the whole industry to market efficient multimodal solutions globally, through Singapore."</p>
      <p>Tan Chong Meng, group CEO of PSA International says: "Shippers are increasingly seeking innovative multimodal solutions for their cargo to reach their preferred markets competitively. This partnership with SATS will enhance Singapore's ability to offer unique air-sea multimodal connectivity to fulfil these demands."</p>

      <p>Turhan Ozen, chief cargo officer of Turkish Airlines, has been elected to the Board of The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA).</p>
      <p>He possesses extensive knowledge of the territories surrounding Turkey, as it has overseen business development in the Balkans, Middle East, and African regions.</p>
      <p>"Turkey is set to become a major aviation transport hub between Europe and Asia, with the opening of new airport," said Sebastiaan Scholte, chairman of TIACA and chief executive officer of Jan de Rijk Logistics.</p>
      <p>"Because Turhan will be present on the ground as this major project works towards completion, his insight will prove invaluable to the TIACA Board and its members."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month Turkish Airlines moved all operations from Ataturk Airport to the new Istanbul Airport. The new airport, due for completion in 2027, will be the busiest hub in the world, with six runways boosting capacity for cargo.</p>
      <p>Ozen is one of several new members recruited to join the TIACA board as part of an ongoing strategy launched in 2018 to focus more on members and content.</p>

      <p>Unilode Aviation Solutions has won the IATA Air Cargo Innovation Award 2019 for its Bluetooth-based tracking system for unit load devices.</p>
      <p>The concept allows customers to use the ULD as a proxy for air cargo located inside to track location and transmit status updates on the temperature, light and shock exposure and humidity.</p>
      <p>Explaining that time and temperature sensitive products are the biggest areas of growth in air cargo, Glyn Hughes, global head of cargo at IATA says: "Customers for these products want to know where these items are, and their condition, at any time during their transport. Unilode's tracking innovation will make this a reality. I congratulate the company on their achievement and use of data to drive improvements in operational quality."</p>
      <p>BenoÃ®t Dumont, CEO of Unilode says the company is very proud to have won the award, saying: "Unilode's aim is to deliver enhanced value to various stakeholders including airlines, ground handlers, shippers and freight forwarders to solve common issues relating to ULDs and cargo, and is looking forward to continuing the development and roll-out of its award-winning digitalisation programme."</p>
      <p>The award was presented at the 13th World Cargo Symposium in Singapore, with an independent jury including experts, academics and CEOs evaluating 56 entries from across the industry.</p>
      <p>Projects were evaluated based on the idea, its potential to create value and likelihood of achieving success.</p>
      <p>Three companies were shortlisted to present their projects to over 500 audience members during the WCS closing plenary who cast their vote, with Unilode receiving $20,000 to develop the idea.</p>
      <p>Hughes says: "To attract demand in new market segments, the air cargo industry must improve its value proposition. Innovation holds the key to industry development, sustainability and success and we are committed to help unlock its potential. It's important to recognise the individuals and companies that are driving change."</p>

    <content>
      <p>The International Freight Logistics Network (IFLN) â a global organization of freight forwarders and logistics companies headquartered in Houston â has launched a new IFLN Global Projects network.</p>
      <p>IFLN president, Michel Vanlerberghe says onlyÂ cargo agents with experience and a high degree of capability in the field of project forwarding will form part of the rapidly expanding group, adding: "We want to be the new force in the world of project logistics management."</p>
      <p>Vanlerberghe explains the thinking behind the decision to establish a network dedicated to project forwarding. "First, the decision was driven by IFLN's desire to develop and to grow; and one way of doing this is to offer different specialisations that the market requires."</p>
      <p>He adds: "Second, we knew from talking to our members that a large number of them specialize in project forwarding â far more so than just handling an occasional outsize or heavy load.</p>
      <p>"Then, we discussed the option of launching a network dedicated to this market and assessed what the members would like to see from such a grouping. We got a lot of positive feedback from them and discovered just how we should structure and operate the network to best effect."</p>
      <p>Vanlerberghe explains thirdly, it saw a need from project freight customers that are looking for an alternative to multinational forwarders, who may not always have adequate coverage and equipment in every part of the world and don't offer the desired strategic flexibility and one on one customer care.</p>
      <p>He adds: "IFLN offers global project logistic services with a dedicated team and experts in every local market â we have the expertise and equipment in place to handle project shipping, wherever it may be required."</p>
      <p>IFLN's general manager, Randy Durham says: "There are other project cargo networks out there, but this one is different. IFLN Global Projects network only accepts as members those who are highly proficient project forwarders."</p>
      <p>He adds: "This is not about having as many members as possible. It's about having project freight forwarder experts who are also specialists in their local markets.</p>
      <p>"Indeed, no member is able to act as the network's representative in any more than three countries, and no country can be covered by more than three IFLN Global Projects network members with a maximum of two offices.</p>
      <p>"It's about quality not quantity," Durham notes, and IFLN will vet all prospective network members. Then again, IFLN does much more than that for the network, he continues. It offers a full range of cohesive support.</p>
      <p>It can put together a team of highly specialised global project members to support any bid or any project cargo shipping task. "As IFLN, we make the necessary introductions, coordinate member efforts and liaise with the customer if needed," Durham notes. "We also really go out and sell our members' expertise and services."</p>
      <p>The nascent network already has more than 40 members and is expanding quickly. "We are very happy with the response from our own IFLN members, and we are now growing the IFLN Global Projects membership with other cargo agents who are dedicated to project forwarding," Vanlerberghe concludes.</p>

      <p>Etihad Cargo has rebranded its "PayLoadRewards" cargo loyalty scheme and renewed its Global Customer programme for freight forwarders.</p>
      <p>Launched in 2013, PayLoadRewards is a dedicated loyalty programme for air cargo customers, who will continue to earn miles as before with an additional opportunity to start earning bonus miles for general cargo and premium cargo through the online booking portal.</p>
      <p>Similar to the passenger Etihad Guest loyalty programme, cargo customers can now receive exclusive benefits upon attaining Silver, Gold or Platinum Tier Status, with further enhancements to be progressively rolled out.</p>
      <p>The renewed Global Customer programme offers freight forwarders three tiers: Global Account, Global Plus and Global Partner, each holding different support levels.</p>
      <p>Haleema Al Hosani, senior manager global accounts and loyalty at Etihad Cargo says: "Today's unveiling of these commercial schemes is a proud result of the interactive dialogue we have been having with our global customers over the past months, aimed at enhancing our value offering. These programmes have been designed to reward growth, trust and consistency, embedding a renewed customer-driven culture into Etihad Cargo's modus operandi."</p>

      <p>Bollore Logistics has inaugurated its Foreign Trade Zone facility in Miami, consolidating freight forwarding and contract logistics services in one location.</p>
      <p>The 200,000 square foot facility, which was inaugurated in the presence of Consul general of France in Miami, Clement Leclerc; Bollore Transport &amp; Logistics chief executive officer (CEO), Cyrille Bollore and Bollore Logistics CEO, Thierry Ehrenbogen consolidates activities that were previously housed at two different locations and the company says this will support operational synergies and cargo turnaround time for customers with time critical logistics requirements.</p>
      <p>The company says that by combining traditional freight forwarding with value added services, the Miami hub has become a multimodal platform meeting needs of its various customers, especially in the cosmetics, aerospace and travel retail industries.</p>
      <p>Bollore Americas CEO, Tony Rodrigues says: "We are extremely proud of our newest logistics centre. Miami is geographically pivotal to regional trade and a strategic location for BollorÃ© Logistics Americas. With this investment, we aim to play a key role in supporting the supply chain transformation of this industry."</p>
      <p>The secure facility has on-site 24/7 guard coverage, biometric access control, CCTV monitoring and recording, perimeter fencing and fire sprinkler systems engineered to handle specific commodity classifications.</p>
      <p>The warehouse offers state of the art infrastructure with 52 dock doors, 32' clear height, 60' speed bay and a line of material handling equipment that Bollore says can handle the warehouse challenges with reliability, power, productivity, performance and efficiency.</p>

      <p>As it seeks to expand its global reach outside China, Alibaba Cloud announced that it will introduce "MaxCompute," to Europe's US$18.9 billion cloud computing market in the second half of 2017.</p>
      <p>The E.U. cloud market is smaller than, say, its U.S. counterpart, but it is already populated by the likes of Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft and IBM, setting the stage for competition. Alibaba said it hopes to get a piece of this action by convincing E.U. businesses that it's artificial intelligence (AI) features can, "unlock the immense value of their data, using a highly secure and scalable cloud infrastructure and AI programs," said Wanli Min, an Alibaba Cloud scientist responsible for AI and data-mining.</p>
      <p>The Chinese cloud provider's AI program is already popular in China, where it has been applied to easing traffic congestion, diagnosing disease through medical imaging, and even predicting the winners of reality show contests.</p>
      <p>MaxCompute intends to deliver these same services to the E.U. market, using advanced AI and deep -earning technologies and algorithms for data storage, modeling and analytics.</p>
      <p>Alibaba Cloud opened its first European data center in Germany in late 2016. The company has not revealed what it's E.U. customer base looks like, but said it is in discussions with companies in Europe about using MaxCompute.</p>

      <p>Singapore Airlines Cargo (SIA Cargo) has selected Zodiac Aerospace for the supply of more than 2,000 Zodiac Herculight S AKE cargo containers.</p>
      <p>The containers, constructed with a combination of composite and aluminium panels, come in two highly customised configurations to target SIA Cargo's needs in both passenger and cargo operations.</p>
      <p>Zodiac says SIA CargoÂ evaluated the Herculight S containers comprehensively and one of the carrier's key requirements was the sustainability of the lightweight unit load deviceÂ to remain functional in operations for many years and explains the Herculight S AKE fits this requirement.</p>
      <p>Zodiac Cabin Equipment vice president of sales,Â Bart van Berkel says: "This truly is a positive quality and testament to the design philosophy we uphold for all of our products. We strive towards the lightest tare weight possible for our products, leading the market trend towards lightest weight with highest durability.</p>
      <p>"At the same time, we strictly will not compromise the performance potential of our products. We look forward to a successful collaboration with Singapore Airlines Cargo for many years to come."</p>

      <p>DHL Supply Chain is testing new technology that monitors warehouse activity in real-time at three pilot sites in Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. Data is aggregated from sensors on scanners and material handling equipment, and DHL's warehouse management system which is then visualised on 'heat maps' to improve efficiency and employee safety. Â  The system is being developed in partnership with networking firm Cisco and airline software specialist Conduce. DHL Supply Chain chief information officer and chief operating officer, Markus Voss, explains: "By monitoring operational activities in real-time rather than retrospectively, we can interpret data more meaningfully, and immediately re-engineer processes or warehouse layouts to boost operational efficiency and address potential safety blind spots in a warehouse." DHL says that the pilots have revealed valuable insights on activity peaks, warehouse layouts and processes by displaying concentrations of pickers and material handling equipment.</p>

      <p>UPS will start training student delivery drivers to spot and identify road hazards using Virtual Reality (VR) headsets that vividly simulate the experience of driving on city streets while teaching a more memorable classroom lesson. The US parcels and logistics giant will begin launching VR training in September at its nine UPS Integrad training facilities. Staff training using VR is proving attractive in the freight industry. Cargo handler Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) has introduced VR training so new staff can gain experience before working in the challenging ramp environment. IT experts at UPS created the VR training modules that users see and hear inside VR headsets like the HTC Vive. Students using the modules must verbally identify potential road hazards such as pedestrians, parked cars and oncoming traffic. The 360-degree view inside the headset is realistic down to the finest details. "Virtual Reality offers a big technological leap in the realm of driver safety training," said Juan Perez, UPS chief information and engineering officer. "VR creates a hyper-realistic streetscape that will dazzle even the youngest of our drivers whose previous exposure to the technology was through video games."  The VR training modules replace the touchscreen devices UPS Integrad facilities currently use to teach lessons on road hazards. For now, the VR training is only for those who drive package delivery trucks. But the company is exploring VR and even Augmented Reality (AR) for training tractor trailer drivers and performing other duties throughout the operation. </p>

      <p>The BRUcargo community in Brussels is launching a new independent organisation that will work to improve the logistics and cargo operations linked to Brussels Airport. The new Air Cargo Belgium organisation, which will be launched in February next year, is the next stage of development of BRUcargo's Strategic Committee. Brussels Airport head of cargo Steven Polmans has been nominated as its chairman. Polmans told Air Cargo News that having a separate legal entity with paying members would make it easier to hirer staff and subsidise projects. He said it had yet to be decided how many staff would be hired and whether they would by full-time or part-time. While Polmans will act as chairman, someone from the local Chamber of Commerce will become vice chairman and the secretary general will be a representative of the airline association. Representatives will be re-elected by members every two years. BRUcargo will continue with its work on developing cargo operations in the Brussels area while ACB will have a much broader scope and wider membership, including suppliers to the air cargo industry Polmans said the new organisation was influenced by the work of Air Cargo Netherlands and that 85% of its members would also be members of the Dutch group. While the new organisation carries Belgium in its name, all work carried by ACB must be to the benefit of Brussels airport. However, Polmans said the organisation could work with other airports on certain topics, such as e-freight, e-air waybill, or pharma facilities, if doing so will improve Brussel's logistics chain for stakeholders. Summarising the ACB in its member newsletter, BRUcargo said: "Early 2016, we will take a next step by forming a new independent organisation taking over these activities and further professionalising them. "The current members of the committee will be the founding members of the new organisation, but other companies and stakeholders will also be able to join. "The new organisation will represent the BRUcargo community on all levels and has a clear goal: strengthen BRUcargo, grow the volumes and drive innovation to the benefit of all stakeholders."</p>

      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo and Kuehne + Nagel have received their continuing certification from Cargo iQ's auditor, and Menzies have joined the group as a new member.</p>
      <p>SGS carried out an independent audit for Cargo iQ, with members undertaking a two day on site visit to demonstrate their processes and services are compliant with quality standards for the worldwide air cargo industry, as created and implemented by the Cargo iQ membership.</p>
      <p>Cargo iQ executive director, Ariaen Zimmerman says: "The response of our members and the industry to our new external audit has been overwhelmingly positive. In an industry which can fall into a cycle of being inward-facing, the value of external validation on our processes and procedures is clear.</p>
      <p>"Each and every one of our members has the opportunity to improve their operations through this."</p>
      <p>Kuehne + Nagel received two certifications, one for its forwarding services and for its internal IT platform for Cargo iQ, the Cargo iQ Data Management Platform.</p>
      <p>Global head carrier and gateway air logistics, Max Sauberschwarz says: "Continuous process optimisation is a crucial part of our air freight business strategy. We are delighted to be the first forwarder who has received the new Cargo iQ Phase 2 certificate. This confirms our high standards in airfreight."</p>
      <p>Qatar Airways acting chief officer for cargo, Guillaume Halleux says: "Air cargo is such an interconnected industry that no success is possible without a consistent and coherent collaboration by all parties in the logistics chain.</p>
      <p>"This certification is certainly a booster for us to continue our active participation in the Cargo iQ working group, setting industry standards that bring progressive changes to the air cargo industry."</p>
      <p>Menzies Aviation vice president of cargo development, Robert Fordree says: "We have recently launched our new cargo strategy across our network and joining Cargo iQ is an integral part of our drive for excellence and a standardised approach to our customers' expectations."</p>
      <p>The group has also launched an Air Cargo Intelligence Hub that gives members real-time access to their performance data, enabling them to develop new products and improve processes.</p>

      <p>Small- and medium-sized forwarders can boost the quality of their air freight services following the successful trial of a new control and planning tool.</p>
      <p>Cargo iQ's SME Solution provides forwarders with live-tracking of individual consignments.</p>
      <p>Executive director Ariaen Zimmerman told The Loadstar the system marked the "first time" SMEs could operate shipment control and planning within one system.</p>
      <p>"We aim to give end-to-end visibility. The first step is to promise access for SME forwarders and more steps are down the line," said Mr Zimmerman.</p>
      <p>"It's a transaction-based fee, you don't need to be a member, but if you are of a certain size, it may become more financially beneficial to join Cargo iQ.</p>
      <p>"There are good reasons to become a member, but this offers a fairly straightforward planning and control solution."</p>
      <p>Following registration with an accredited Cargo iQ SME IT service provider, forwarders can use Cargo iQ performance management tools immediately.</p>
      <p>An official launch would be in the "coming months", said the company, after a full evaluation of the trial.</p>
      <p>"We concluded there was real demand in the market and technical solutions available for us to address the lack of SME forwarders in Cargo iQ," said Mr Zimmerman.</p>
      <p>"We have aligned the systems so we can all go forward, and you can apply Cargo iQ quality standards for every shipment."</p>
      <p>Italy-based CCS was a participant in the trial, utilising Riege Software's back-end Cargo Data Management Platform (CDMP) technology.</p>
      <p>A source from CCS told The Loadstar that Cargo iQ had been seen as an "elite club for big forwarders", but with the new system, "everyone was interested".</p>
      <p>Senior consultant at CCS Italy Gianni Mauri said: "Taking part in Cargo iQ's SME Solution trial is a great opportunity.Â It allowed us to demonstrate how independent freight forwarders can work with air cargo carriers to benefit the overall air cargo industry."</p>

      <p>FOUR companies have been awarded licenses to operate at six airports in Tanzania, ending Swissport's role as sole ground handler.</p>
      <p>The move by The Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) would boost competition, reducing charges and fares. The quartet of new companies is Aviation Handling Services, DTP Jet Concept, Mtwara Aviation Services and Taha Fresh Handling.</p>
      <p>"Every ground-handling company will work to their best ability in order to meet the expectations of their customers," TCCA assistant public information officer Anita Jonas said. "Customers will get value for their money, [as] the charges will not be as high and clearance of goods will be much faster due to the fact that more ground-handling companies will be offering the services."</p>
      <p>Swissport Tanzania met the requirements and was licensed to operate at Class I airports in Tanzania for a term of five years effective from 25 May 2008. The license allowed the company to operate at any airport in the country, subject to obtaining a concession from the respective airport operator.</p>

      <p>Mercator has launched the Intelligent Cargo Ecosystem, the first open API platform the air cargo management and ground handling, which its says will help carriers revolutionise air cargo management.</p>
      <p>It will be showcasing its Warehouse App, a digital solution enabling air cargo carriers to connect goods, people, data and processes to transform warehousing operations and Mercator says it is the first in a series of breakthrough applications to be rolled out as part of the Intelligent Cargo Ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Mercator says the new open architecture platform enables air cargo carriers to break away from constraints of legacy systems by allowing handlers and operators to make process changes within the system quickly.</p>
      <p>It says the app will let companies introduce new services, for example carriers moving small consumer packages and perishable goods more effectively by having full visibility into the movements of the shipments and optimising air cargo management processes to reduce delays and minimise the risk of disruption.</p>
      <p>Mercator chief technology officer, Brendan McKittrick says: "Mobile technology and open API platforms will revolutionise the industry, allowing carriers to get a real-time digital view of the entire air cargo supply chain. The technology can really transform the industry, providing much greater visibility, versatility, and above all, the ability to simplify complex and challenging processes."</p>
      <p>The app allows warehouse agents to capture all air cargo data through a single mobile interface and achieve full visibility into every stage of warehouse management, from acceptance and relocation, through to breakdown, build-up, delivery and tracking billing data.</p>
      <p>Finnair Cargo is one of the first carriers to deploy the Warehouse App, and vice president head of cargo, Janne Tarvainen says: "We are very pleased to have Mercator as a partner in this significant project. The Warehouse App will be an important tool for years to come. The new mobile and digital system, alongside our investment in a new cargo terminal, will revolutionise Finnair's cargo system for customers and partners."</p>

      <p>On June 28,Â Swissport InternationalÂ opened its second air cargo warehouse at Vienna International Airport (VIE).</p>
      <p>The 2,100 square foot buildingÂ is located directly adjacent to the airfield, allowing for faster transportation of cargo to and from the aircraft, according to Swissport. With the new facility, built byÂ Flughafen Wien AG, the ground handler hosts a total of 7,000 square meters in warehouse space at VIE.</p>
      <p>Swissport said that itÂ entered into a "long-term lease agreement for the facility"Â withÂ VIE, butÂ did not provide further details. The ground handler did say, however, that it hasÂ relocated its cargo documentation to new offices in the facility, in accordance with the agreement.</p>
      <p>Swissport also told Air Cargo World it is planning for a "10to/aqm/p.a. utilization rate" in its facilities at VIE, though it depends on the actual mix of carriers and cargoes.</p>
      <p>"VIE is a growing hub airport and we are closely monitoring the developments around the airport infrastructure, i.e. the planned additional runway," the ground handler added.</p>
      <p>TheÂ opening of this second warehouse at VIE continuesÂ Swissport'sÂ global expansionsÂ efforts over theÂ past year, which include the inking of anÂ agreementÂ with Fraport GroupÂ and the totalÂ acquisitionÂ of Heathrow Cargo Handling Ltd.</p>

      <p>Delta Cargo is the first US passenger airline to recently introduce a new Bluetooth tracking technology, with real-time tracking for unit load devices (ULDs).</p>
      <p>It marks a new era for Delta Cargo and for over 500 million kilograms of cargo, which it carries every year. The technology will replace manual tracking for all shipping containers and introduce ULDs, which will help move cargo shipments, baggage and mail, globally.</p>
      <p>"Our customers expect improved tracking and immediate transparency for ULD shipments, and this best-in-class product will deliver exactly that," said Shawn Cole, vice president â cargo, Delta Cargo.</p>
      <p>"Our innovative tracking technology, in conjunction with our 24/7 cargo control center, offers us the competitive edge to serve our customers," said Cole.</p>
      <p>Real-time ULD tracking information will also allow Delta's cargo control center to more accurately monitor and reroute shipments that are delayed due to irregular operations, like inclement weather.</p>
      <p>The new tracking system will also enable Delta Cargo to produce electronic unit control receipts, which is mandated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), while ULDs are transferred between parties, thereby making it the first cargo airline to offer a fully automated solution for customer transactions.</p>
      <p>Delta was the first airline to test Bluetooth tracking technology in 2016, and has since deployed readers to 23 locations.</p>
      <p>By the end of 2018, the tracking system will be available on all of Delta's ULDs, with over 1,400 readers tracking customer shipments at more than 200 airports across six continents.</p>
      <p>The airline's current GPS-enabled cargo tracking products, including a recently-announced service for highly time-sensitive shipments called 'Equation Critical', will be available for both narrow body and wide-body aircraft shipments traveling internationally and within the US.</p>
      <p>Delta recently introduced auto check-in for Fly Delta app users, and has started testing its biometric boarding pass at DCA and its redesigned E-Gate experience in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Over the last few year, Delta Cargo has led the industry on a number of other innovative customer solutions, such as biometric-based self-service bag drop, RFID baggage handling, real-time bag tracking through its Fly Delta mobile app, more efficient and high tech automated screening lanes and a groundbreaking flight deck app that helps its pilots avoid turbulence for a more comfortable flight.</p>
      <p>Delta's partnership with CLEAR offers exclusive rates to the US-based SkyMiles members for a faster way through security lines at more than 20 airports nationwide.</p>

      <p>Jettainer and Lufthansa Industry Solutions are to cooperate on creating "intelligent" containers to help accelerate maintenance and control procedures in the future.</p>
      <p>The containers will be able to provide information including location, temperature changes, shocks and other external factors independently and provide information about its state.</p>
      <p>The new generation of containers will accelerate maintenance and control procedures, and at the same time the increased level of transparency will make it easier to determine who is responsible for any damage to the ULD. It is hoped companies will take greater care of the units, reducing damage.</p>
      <p>Jettainer managing director, Carsten Hernig says: "The intelligent container will ensure greater transparency within the process chain in future. We're deliberately breaking new ground here in order to make our services for customers even more efficient in future."</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Industry Solutions is to use its experience in tracking technologies in developing the digital containers, with other functions to be gradually added.</p>

      <p>Two more companies have joined the now not-so-exclusive group of logistics providers offering digital freight sales platforms available in air cargo â today,Â Panalpina announced it will present its new customer platform atÂ Air Cargo EuropeÂ 2019Â in Munich this week, while DHL Global Forwarding (DHL GF) launched its own platform last week. While the growing number of these platforms indicatesÂ process digitalization is the new norm, how can air cargo stakeholders determine which providers are successful in their pursuit of this trend?</p>
      <p>In a 2017 study,Â FreightosÂ surveyed freight forwarders on what service differentiation meant to them in the era of digital freight. Freight forwarders said that value-added services and customer service were critical to determining service differentiation among providers. For forwarders this meant easy automation for seamless operations â they did not want to invest in a cloud-based mailroom requiring manual processes. The first steps in automation forwarders are looking for include:</p>
      <p>Providers are clearly taking note of these expectations, as seen in the development of service offerings provided most recently by Panalpina and DHL GF.</p>
      <p>Panalpina's new "customer portal" is designed to provide fully automated and instantÂ quotes, collaborative shipment management andÂ real-timeÂ lane risk assessment. According to Panalpina, the collaborative feature of its platform that allows customers and external partners to work in remote teams on the platformÂ is an industry-first. The lane risk assessment feature will also support customers, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, to assess and determine the most reliable shipment planning, even months before a shipment. The company said it is alsoÂ working to add additional features, such as machine learning for quotation, a chatbot and big data analysis. Panalpina is allowing interested customers to test the portal at the conference before its launch later this year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, DHL GF's "myDHLiÂ Quote &amp; Book" is designed to provide customers instantÂ quotes forÂ air and oceanÂ shipments, as well as transport insurance. On the platform, customers can compare the rates and lead times of air and ocean freight with end-to-end visibility. Customers can also save quotes â valid for 30 days â and share them via e-mail with selected recipients.Â With the platform, customers may also request a quote on the platform for special cargo, including dangerous goods, lithium batteries and non-stackable cargo.</p>
      <p>Whether these new platforms, in addition to the many other existing and developing platforms, are successful in meeting freight forwarders' expectations remains to be seen. Regardless, it is likely we will soon see more emerge on the subject over the next year.</p>

      <p>Logistics firm Dachser has expanded its airfreight station at Shanghai Pudong Airport Bonded Zone. The Germany-headquartered firm said work on its facility in Shanghai to expand it to 6,000 sq m from 3,000 sq m had now been completed. The expansion allows the company to operate with a two airport gateway strategy. This will speed up airfreight processing, the company said. Inbound and outbound cargo for the ten Dachser branches in its north China region will be routed throughÂ  Shanghai Pudong Airport and the Beijing International Airport, depending on their geographical proximity, specific requirements of the goods and current market situation. "The north China gateway demonstrates Dachser's high quality process management across continents," said Yves Larquemin, managing director air and sea logistics north China." "Consolidating cargo via the gateway instead of handling it individually at local airports will harmonize processes and extend service capabilities," said David Wang, airfreight gateway manager north China. </p>

      <p>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is to develop an early warning system for pharma shippers with the help of a â¬1m research grant, it was revealed at the IATA World Cargo Symposium on 14 March. The money, from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and TKI Dinalog, the Dutch Institute for Advanced Logistics, will fund data collection and monitoring of Pharma Gateway Amsterdam (PGA) shipments to identify exceptions such as temperature excursions. The information will then be used to design a model to alert shippers when there has been an issue with their consignment. Schiphol has teamed up with Air France KLM Cargo, Cargonaut, and PGA members for the project, which starts this month and with results expected later this year. The Schiphol Cargo Community and Cargonaut will add performance management and alerting capabilities to the community Cloud; Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and Delft University of Technology will do the underlying research, contribute to the development, and measure the benefits for shippers and their transport suppliers. Stekelenburg said: "Pharma shippers are asking for more visibility so they can have confidence that their sensitive cargo is being handled safely through the supply chain and find solutions if there are issues such as temperature excursions. "This research will enable us to develop a system capable of stepping up to those challenges." Air France KLM Cargo executive vice-president Marcel de Nooijer added: "We are keen to improve the supply chain in collaboration with other parties in the chain, contributing to overall higher product integrity for pharmaceutical shipments." while Sebastiaan Scholte, chief executive of PGA member company, Jan de Rijk Logistics commented: "We hope that many other air cargo supply chain communities will follow this example and work together, because this is how the whole industry will improve." Speaking at an event to announce the development, Schiphol Airport cargo director Jonas van Stekelenburg said it was down to members of the organisation how they would use the data provided when an alert is triggered. "Not everyone handles a warning in the same way," he said. "This is up to the parties themselves. We have 13 members who are going to develop the system. "There is not going to be a rule that everyone is going to share everything with everyone, but what we want is an improvement in the pharma shipment process, of course. "Shippers want to know if something goes wrong and what the action will be. We hope that in the end everyone will know everything, but at the beginning we will take it slowly and whoever generates the data decides what happens to that data." Scholte added: "If the data is shared amongst all the players in air cargo supply chain then you can take corrective measurements sooner than if it is not shared." Kester Meijer, director of operational integrity, compliance and safety at Air France KLM, added: "When we get the data from the cargo community portal we can immediately take action and see where in the supply chain, when it is under our control, whether we can do anything. "In hindsight you can also do data analysis â what are the routings where you see these excursions â and take action to ensure that it does not re-occur in the future." PGA, formed a year ago with the aim of providing a transparent and qualified process for pharma, includes 13 members representing forwarders, ground handlers, hauliers, and airlines. Its members are expected to be certified to the IATA CEIV Pharma standard, and benefit from cooperative and competitive knowledge sharing.</p>

      <p>Thailand International Freight Forwarders Association (TIFFA EDI Services) has achieved over 220 times in growth volumes of EDI transactions since implementing Kale Logistics Solutions' PING services on the ezyCompliance platform.</p>
      <p>Several other performance parameters such as saving up to 80% on each ENS/AMS filings and an increase of about eight times in MAWB filings were other significant accomplishments by TIFFA EDI Services.</p>
      <p>The e-freight initiative aims to remove paper documents from the supply chain, developed with regional stakeholders to replace paper air waybills with electronic data interchange message formats.</p>
      <p>Thailand is a key country for air waybill volume, and the focus for TIFFA EDI Services has been to implement e-AWB and later expand the technology adoption to include e-freight compliance.</p>
      <p>Amar More, director of Kale Logistics Solution says: "We are glad that we could provide the necessary technological innovation and support to TIFFA EDI Services for their growth story. PING services has capability to push the global e-AWB adoption globally and we strive to work towards creating digital air freight communities worldwide using such innovations."</p>
      <p>Anusorn Lovichit, managing director of TIFFA EDI Services says: "There has been an increase in the number of customers handled on this platform by eighteen times in between 2014 and 2018. We are confident that this platform will further facilitate trade in addition to Thailand's National Single Window for electronic transactions which is emerging as a key requirement for global trade."</p>

      <p>Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals (Hactl) has introduced a Virtual Reality (VR) training environment, enabling new staff to gain experience before working on the ramp.</p>
      <p>The COSAC-VR provides users with an interactive, fully immersive, 360 degrees, four-dimensional experience, with the first phase covering aircraft cargo compartment operations, and other areas of Hactl operations will be included in future modules.</p>
      <p>COSAC-VR overcomes the limitations of on-the-job-training in preparing new staff for working in ramp handling, the fast pace of work, and the restricted opportunity to practice on real aircraft and ramp equipment.</p>
      <p>The system is not dependent on a high technology, fixed location training suite, but is fully portable and can be quickly set up in any location.</p>
      <p>The VR is expected to speed up the learning process, enable trainees to experience a wider variety of scenarios such as handling odd-sized cargo pallets and special loads, and enhance safety awareness.</p>
      <p>Hactl senior manager for learning and development, Simon Yap says: "In the past, newly-recruited ground service staff had to undergo extensive classroom training before experiencing the real-life aircraft cargo handling environment."</p>
      <p>"COSAC-VR has reduced the reliance on real aircraft availability and suitable weather conditions for training, and trainees meanwhile can undergo work simulations in a totally safe environment."</p>
      <p>Hactl chief executive, Mark Whitehead says young recruits are well versed in VR technology due to using computer games, so VR should help them and turn learning into an enjoyable experience.</p>
      <p>He says: "This is just the beginning: we will add progressively to COSAC-VR's scope, and look at other ways to deploy VR, such as staff induction and internal communication. We are very interested in exploring collaboration with our airline customers on the VR training concept, for our mutual benefit."</p>

      <p>Finnair Cargo has become the latest airline to sign up to offer its capacity through booking portal cargo.one.</p>
      <p>The portal will allow the airline's freight forwarder customers to digitally book spot market capacities at live prices and with direct booking confirmation. The deal was announced at IATA's World Cargo Symposium.</p>
      <p>Fredrik Wildtgrube, head of global sales at Finnair Cargo, said: "Digital connectivity is the missing link to guarantee end-to-end speed, quality and continuous improvement in the industry. We are happy to now offer our customers a fully digital first-class booking experience with cargo.one.</p>
      <p>"Making our offers available digitally through cargo.one is a forward-thinking move and will benefit both our customers and Finnair Cargo now and in the long-term."</p>
      <p>Finnair Cargo customers, such as Hellmann Worldwide Logistics which also uses cargo.one, welcome the partnership.</p>
      <p>Jan Kleine-Lasthues, global head of airfreight at Hellmann Worldwide Logistics, said: "We are very pleased to see Finnair Cargo joining the cargo.one platform, underscoring its image as a customer oriented and forward-thinking cargo carrier. We compliment the decision to join the multi-carrier platform in an effort to decrease complexity for customers, rather than to focus on a proprietary channel."</p>
      <p>Moritz Claussen, managing director of cargo.one added: "While some players in the industry still lament about digitalization, Finnair Cargo joins leading cargo carriers in the pursuit to actively drive the industry's digital development, to the benefit of their customers and to further strengthening their position in the market.</p>
      <p>"With the partnership, cargo.one becomes even more attractive for forwarders, adding more destinations in North America and Asia â and a platformÂ no airline should want to be missed on".</p>
      <p>The Finnair Cargo offering is planned to be available on the cargo.one platform starting from May 2019.</p>
      <p>Other companies to sign up to the platform include: Lufthansa Cargo, Leisure Cargo, DachserÂ and JAS Forwarding.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa Cargo, along with others, has also invested in the platform.</p>

      <p>Kerry Logistics has introduced six fully-automated and programmed robotic butlers at its flagship product customisation and consolidation centre (PC3) in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The logistics service provider says it has brought in the robots to meet "the ever-growing consumer demands in online shopping".</p>
      <p>According to Kerry Logistics, the robots "speed-toâmarketÂ order fulfillment isÂ theÂ key to successÂ inÂ theÂ retailÂ industry.Â The process of pickingÂ products is at the heart of e-commerceÂ operations, whereÂ high volumesÂ of small and irregularÂ ordersÂ predominate".</p>
      <p>The robotic butlers have been deployed in Kerry Logistics' order fulfilment centre, where sales orders from retailers and e-commerce marketplaces are processed. Real-time orders are transmitted to the robots via Kerry Logistics' proprietary warehouse management system (WMS) .</p>
      <p>Designated shelves are then delivered to the pick station. A simple lighting indicates which items to include in shipments, with every item tracked via barcodes.</p>
      <p>TheÂ roboticÂ butlersÂ operate 24 hours a day, andÂ can pickÂ 280Â items per hour, Kerry Logistics says, benefiting from a pick rate four times faster than that of traditional methods.Â This solution, according to the logistics specialist, is ideal for retail brands which sell a wide variety of consumer products.</p>
      <p>KerryÂ LogisticsÂ operatesÂ across China and Asia. It has more than 550 offices in 40 countries and territories.</p>
