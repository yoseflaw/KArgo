      <p>Lufthansa Cargo customers and partners can receive binding offers to be booked immediately through the smartBooking digital interface.</p>
      <p>The application programming interface (API) via digital sales channel cargo.one contains available routes, capacity and prices, and automatically executes all relevant checks.</p>
      <p>The offer can be booked in real time and confirmed straightaway, and Lufthansa Cargo now has a completely digitalised offer and booking process.</p>
      <p>Aside from direct customers, partners can also use the smartBooking API to make their platforms more informative and customer-oriented with immediate access to capacity and prices.</p>
      <p>Peter Gerber, CEO of Lufthansa Cargo says the airline wants to offer customers seamless digital solutions, and connecting digitally with partners is the way to achieve this.</p>
      <p>He says: "SmartBooking is another major step in our digital transformation process. APIs will continue to gain in importance as an interface to our customers. We are delighted that as first platform our partner cargo.one is using smartBooking, making our services digitally available to many customers."</p>
      <p>Oliver Neumann, managing director of cargo.one says: "Our aim is to deliver the best customer experience possible and to drive value and efficiency for the airfreight industry. Accordingly, we are excited to be the first Lufthansa Cargo partner to benefit from the new smartBooking API."</p>

      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo has designed and implemented a new cargo management system called CROAMIS to manage its end-to-end airline cargo business processes.</p>
      <p>The single system will run the carrier's cargo reservations, operations, accounting and management information system, serving the airline's entire global freight network, which it says is designed to scale with the future growth expected.</p>
      <p>CROAMIS was developed in-house by Qatar Airways through an innovative co-funded model with global IT services provider Wipro.</p>
      <p>The integrated system enables comprehensive automation of the airline's core business functions and supports collaborative operations across the airline's cargo supply chain.</p>
      <p>The system incorporates the latest practices in business functions including sales, pricing, cargo ground handling, and unit load device management.</p>
      <p>CROAMIS also provides an integrated revenue management module for inventory management, cargo load and revenue optimisation and also has a robust revenue accounting suite.</p>
      <p>It has been developed using platform independent state-of-the-art technology, which facilitates modular deployment and is also cloud ready.</p>
      <p>Qatar Airways chief officer for cargo, Ulrich Ogiermann, explains the system provides 100 per cent coverage of all cargo business functions in a single application.</p>
      <p>"CROAMIS will align our end-to-end cargo business processes and provide the entire global cargo network with a seamless system that will support our projected growth," Ogiermann adds.</p>

      <p>ULD management solutions provider Unilode and ULD manufacturer PalNet have jointly developed an integrated digital solution for all types of PalNet pallets.</p>
      <p>The integrated solution minimises the risk of damage or loss of the digital tag and does not obstruct daily operations or interfere with pallet stacking.</p>
      <p>Unilode's digital technology is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5, enables ULD tracking and measurement of temperature and shock.</p>
      <p>The solution will be implemented to the entire ULD fleet of Unilode, starting second quarter of 2019. It is also available for non-Unilode customers. All existing PalNet pallets, including heavy duty pallets, can be retrofitted with the integrated digital solution. Pallets can also be acquired ex-works with a pre-installed tag.</p>
      <p>Benoit Dumont, CEO, Unilode said: "We are confident that we can deliver a durable, superior and DO-160 conform product to the aviation industry, which will not only enhance ULD management operations, but also add value throughout the supply chain. We are pleased to have developed this solution in collaboration with PalNet."</p>

      <p>Ground handler LUG Aircargo is implementing a new ramp service and time slot management system at its Cargo City South terminal in Frankfurt airport from mid-May. The software automatically allocates loading bays for the delivery and collection of shipments and for road feeder services. Users can reserve slots at the ramp in advance by entering their vehicle's expected time of arrival, whether it is an import or export and other consignment information such as weight or number of pieces into LUG's web-based aiRSS software. After validating the information, the system assigns a time slot and ramp based on the user's arrival information or makes an alternative suggestion if there are no available slots at the requested time. It also calculates the loading or unloading time based on the freight volume and initiates the documentation process before arrival. On arrival at the LUG terminal, drivers proceed directly to the pre-booked ramp. Identification and shipping documents are presented at the LUG Customer Service Centre, where they are compared with the pre-arrival information, and the cargo is then loaded or unloaded. If the vehicle arrives before the booked time slot, misses it or if the freight details have changed, the information can be updated on the website or via mobile devices, even at short notice, as the system allows for flexible rescheduling,  assigning a new time slot or ramp if necessary and alerting LUG staff to the change. Forwarders who use the Fair@Link Frankfurt cargo community system to pre-register transport can continue to do so – the pre-arrival notice is forwarded to LUG and automatically imported into aiRSS. Customers who arrive at the terminal without a pre-requested time slot will continue to be served on a first come, first-served basis but this might entail a waiting time if all ramps are occupied or pre-booked. LUG sales executive Sven Kaufmann said the system would benefit customers as "it shortens idle and lead times and accelerates loading, unloading and the documentation processes. "Forwarders can see on the website if we are busy or if capacity is available. Based on that information they can choose a time slot which enables them to drive directly to the booked loading ramp." Manager of the customer service centre and project manager aiRSS, Philipp Wahlig, added: "Freight forwarders benefit from the accelerated handling procedures and increased planning security. "LUG benefits by increasing its ability to improve and adjust staff and equipment deployment to better match the workload."</p>

      <p>THE systematic digitisation of the airfreight business is at the top of Lufthansa Cargo's (LC) 2014 agenda, a conference has heard.  Addressing more than 200 logistics industry representatives at the Lufthansa Cargo in Dialogue event, Dr Andreas Otto, LC's board director, stressed the company's commitment to ensuring "goods find their way through the complex supply chain faster, more efficiently and with even greater reliability".  "Closer networking is crucial to this, especially via digital interfaces," he states.  Expanding electronic processes is a key element in the German carrier's 2020 programme.  Last year the Frankfurt-based airline established an e-Award, aimed at supporting the adoption of digital procedures between forwarders and carriers.  The award takes into account a number of factors, including the percentage of electronic bookings and the use of efreight. Ipsen Logistics (overall winner) and Kuehne + Nagel (forwarder with more than 10,000 airwaybills per year) were the first recipients.  Florian Pfaff, vice-president of area management in Germany at Lufthansa Cargo, emphasises: "We had a successful start with the eAWB last year in Munich. We will roll this out to all other German stations over the course of the year. It's becoming increasingly obvious that digitising the process chain benefits everyone – consignors, forwarders and airlines."</p>

      <p>CORE Transport Technologies has shipped outs its 15,000th COREInsight Bluetooth Tracking tag for active deployment since its launch in October 2017.</p>
      <p>The tracking tag started as an idea in early 2016, and the patented container and pallet tags utilise Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to actively track assets.</p>
      <p>CORE says compared to other tracking solutions used to manage assets and shipments, the COREInsight Tracking brings dramatic increases in battery life, field of view, ease of installation and cost effectiveness.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand-based company says patented plug-and-play readers can convert any location into an Internet of Things (IoT) hub within minutes and public deployment started after launch customers Delta Air Lines, Air New Zealand and Alaska Airlines along with ACL Airshop realised the benefits of automated ULD tracking and an interconnected fleet.</p>
      <p>Over 15 airlines are in various stages of implementation with CORE's technology resulting in full deployment of BLE on their fleets.</p>
      <p>CORE chief executive officer, Ian Craig says: "Whilst others might have wishful upstart efforts with Bluetooth Low Energy or similar technologies for the Airline industry, it's factual and fair to say we are already there, with a very large proven network that is only getting bigger and more effective as a logistics tool every week, every month. We are accelerating our progress for our Air Carrier customers, others are merely playing catch-up."</p>
      <p>CORE's tracking network extends to over 100 major airports and 650 sub-locations worldwide, with the addition of 30 new cities and 85 sub-locations last month.</p>
      <p>As Bluetooth in air transport evolves, CORE says its technology can be used not only to track ULDs but also manage other customer owned resources, with airlines using the COREInsight portfolio to track aircraft tooling, galley carts, cargo and baggage carts, tractor/trailers and ground service equipment.</p>

      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has been presented with its Cargo iQ certification having had its processes to minimise shipping errors and provide visibility reviewed by an external auditor.</p>
      <p>The freight division of Emirates became a member of Cargo iQ in 2016 to reinforce service standards and in less than two years it has integrated Cargo iQ shipment cycle management standards as the basis for its live shipment planning and tracking of cargo.</p>
      <p>Cargo iQ executive director, Ariaen Zimmerman says: "The way Emirates SkyCargo has integrated the Cargo iQ Master Operating Plan with their internal procedures is a clear example of how implementing our standards offers so much more than a mere monthly report, and can actually lead to better process and shipment control."</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has invested in setting up and operating a dedicated Cargo Operations Control Centre (COCC) to monitor the status of shipments in real time.</p>
      <p>The COCC, which is operational 24/7 uses live shipment data and Cargo iQ metrics to track the progress of the shipment's journey and alerts are automatically generated when there is a deviation along the route, allowing the COCC to intervene proactively and in real time.</p>
      <p>Emirates divisional senior vice president for cargo, Nabil Sultan says: "Over the last two years we have worked on integrating the vision of Cargo iQ into our processes and our 'Delivered as Promised' commitment to our customers.</p>
      <p>"Getting the Cargo iQ certification and the setting up of our 24/7 Cargo Operations Control Centre are the first steps in a journey where we can be more transparent and at the same time more proactively support our customer promises."</p>
      <p>The Cargo iQ Routemap is integrated into the framework of the COCC, ensuring that the service promise and journey updates are exchanged between Emirates SkyCargo and the customer, improving transparency and allowing customers to effectively plan their logistics value chain.</p>

Founder and managing director Stelios Ntounakis will remain in these roles and manage the businesses together with time:matters. The companies' more than 70 employees will also be kept on.</p>
      <p>Ntounakis said: "CB Customs Broker and Customs Broker Cargo Handling will continue to go from strength to strength under the time:matters umbrella.

      <p>CHEP Aerospace Solutions and Air Transat have extended their unit load device (ULD) management partnership for a further five years.</p>
      <p>Since 2003, CHEP has managed the entire pool of ULDs for Air Transat's growing fleet, including the supply of lightweight ULDs to maximise operational efficiency and sustainability.</p>
      <p>CHEP says the continued collaboration will ensure that Air Transat can continue to build their growing network whilst benefitting from CHEP's expertise and flexible service at the overall lowest cost.</p>
      <p>CHEP Aerospace Solutions president, Dr. Ludwig Bertsch, believes CHEP's commitment to customer service and continuous improvement is the key to the ongoing success: "Our global pooling network has significantly increased over the past years which has enabled us to offer more synergies and better solutions to our airline customers.</p>
      <p>"We value the partnership we have built and are pleased to continue our participation in Air Transat's growth and success."</p>

      <p>CORE Transport Technologies has upgraded its COREInsight Bluetooth Tracking, improving ULD tracking with greater speed, range and payload capacity.</p>
      <p>The upgrade was unveiled at the ULD Care global symposium in Guangzhou, China where the company showed off implementing a BLE resilient mesh network incorporating military grade security, which can support hundreds of low cost nodes over a very large area.</p>
      <p>The nodes can relay messages over multiple nodes to the nearest cellular gateway making the network totally resilient to hardware or cellular failures.</p>
      <p>The equipment is using BLE5 (Bluetooth Low Energy) hardware and software, which will double speed, provide four times the range and increase the payload by eight times.</p>
      <p>Existing readers and tags can be integrated into the mesh by software utilising over the air updates, providing a fast and easy transition to the new technology, and existing equipment will acquire the benefits of range and speed through BLE5 relays.</p>
      <p>COREInsight Bluetooth Tracking will be further enhanced by localisation with mesh tags being read by multiple relays and the signal strength being recorded for each and forwarded automatically to a reader or another relay; waterproof solar powered relay providing the largest gain in tracking technology by taking the data collection device to the tag itself; and BLE Mesh Enabled Readers to share data should communications became inadequate.</p>
      <p>CORE chief executive officer, Ian Craig says: "We've been preparing for today for a long time. While we introduced a Bluetooth tracking system to the world in 2016, today we have reached a new milestone in the COREInsight Bluetooth Tracking product line – BLE5.0, Relay Enhancement, BLE Mesh Readers – all of these together create a sound and successful system to enrich our Customers' tracking experience."</p>
      <p>ACL Airshop chief executive officer, Steve Townes says: "CORE's patented Bluetooth applications for the air cargo industry are a game changer for airlines and their shipper customers.</p>
      <p>"Now implementing with a number of forward-thinking airlines, including one of the world's Top Ten, this latest technology upgrade from CORE can yield new competitive advantages and logistics efficiencies for airlines."</p>

      <p>Lödige Industries, a leading provider of airport logistics solutions, has completed the installation of a brand new ULD handling system for its customer dnata at London Heathrow's City East.</p>
      <p>The new facility, which features two high performance (ground rail) elevating transfer vehicles (ETVs) was completed in just four months while the terminal building was being built around it. dnata's City East is Heathrow's most state-of-the-art cargo facility and will deliver greater automation and faster truck and cargo handling times.</p>
      <p>The cargo handling facility delivered by Lödige features component redundancy to reduce downtime and improved controls to automatically position machines, speeding up retrieval and storage operations. Utilising British Steel racks, the terminal integrates cold room facilities, giving dnata the necessary functionality and flexibility to move healthcare and life science products as well as perishables, required by today's air cargo industry.</p>
      <p>The high-speed storage and sorting equipment enables dnata's handling crew to dispatch a full flight extremely quickly. Michael Baul, managing director of Lödige Industries in the UK, said, "With only four months on site to complete the installation, we are very pleased to have manufactured and installed this solution in such a short time. To ensure dnata can start its new operations on time and to deliver the whole project, from quote to handover in just over twelve months, says a lot about Lödige Industries capability to deliver quickly in the air cargo industry".</p>

      <p>DHL has purchased 60,000 square metres of land at Vienna Airport to act as a freighter hub for Eastern Europe and open up the region to all modes of transport.</p>
      <p>The contract was signed by DHL Global Forwarding and DHL Freight, and starting in the summer of 2018, the DHL Campus Vienna Airport will be developed in the Fischamend district.</p>
      <p>The company says that by establishing a joint site, synergies between land, air and ocean transport will be exploited more effectively.</p>
      <p>DHL Freight chief executive officer (CEO), Uwe Binks says: "The site is in proximity to Vienna airport and as such strategically well-located, providing us with low-threshold access to Eastern European markets and Germany. Through this project, we will establish an important new logistics hub together, creating a gateway into and out of the east and enabling us to further grow our volumes."</p>
      <p>Both divisions will each build a warehouse including office buildings on the new site, connecting them to the airport and linking them to its infrastructure, with the three present DHL Global Forwarding and DHL Freight locations being merged on the new campus.</p>
      <p>The new site, which will border the A4 motorway that connects the airport with Vienna city centre, will have a higher number of docks and will also have cross-docks for the first time.</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding managing director for Austria, Christoph Wahl says: "Located directly at Vienna airport, Fischamend perfectly meets our requirements for the DHL Campus, through which we intend to bundle our expertise, improve our service, and consequently further strengthen our market position in Austria."</p>
      <p>DHL Global Forwarding CEO for Eastern Europe, Hermann Filz adds: "Good connections to Eastern Europe are particularly crucial for us. Thanks to our shared base with DHL Freight and the proximity to the airport, we will be able to serve this market even more effectively."</p>
      <p>The warehouses and office buildings will not only meet the highest security standards but also comply with environmental protection requirements, and the sustainable design and use of renewable energies will contribute to DHL's goal of reducing logistics related emissions to zero by 2050.</p>

      <p>SMEs can invite logistics providers to submit a quote and receive responses in real-time from providers that best match their indicated requirements.</p>
      <p>Cargobase chief executive officer, Wiebe Helder says: "In the last five years, we have proven and really crystallised our unique proposition to the industry; to bring value to all shippers and logistics providers, regardless of size. Launching a user-friendly curated marketplace model is a logical next step for us.</p>
      <p>"With Cargobase Mercado, we get to apply the data insights, learnings, and expertise we have gained from dealing with our user base of Fortune 500 shippers and their providers, and extend the benefits of a curated marketplace and automation to SMEs."</p>
      <p>Prior to this launch, Cargobase celebrated a new milestone for its Enterprise platform, having successfully automated the management of over 50,000 spot-buy freight shipments – in a closed environment – for some of the world's largest shippers including the likes of Siemens, Bosch and STMicroelectronics, as well as top freight forwarders such as DHL Global Forwarding, CEVA and Kuehne + Nagel.</p>
      <p>Cargobase head of product, Alex van Kampen says: "Our data shows that our existing enterprise shippers enjoy an average of 27 per cent on Cost Avoidance, and that providers have an average 32 per cent win-rate on opportunities – A direct result of our platform's curation and automation capabilities."</p>

      <p>At an event to celebrate the opening of two new terminals at DHL's Leipzig hub, the express operator was keen to show off what it claims is the world's first automated pallet handling system (see end of article for video). The system is fairly similar to DHL's parcel and flyer system at the hub, but the shipments it handles are much bigger. First ULDs are unloaded from aircraft and the pallets contained within are taken out by forklift and placed on a yellow tray on the pallet handler and scanned. The pallet is then automatically whisked 12 m up onto the mezzanine floor where it is transferred to the correct area of the hub before heading back to ground level to be taken off the yellow tray and placed in a ULD waiting to be loaded on an aircraft heading to the shipment's final destination. The system can handle shipments with a maximum weight of 170kg and measuring 2 m wide with a depth and height of 1 m each. In total, the system can handle 5,000 pallets per hour and the trays travel at 2 m per second. </p>

      <p>Virtual airline Leisure Cargo is the latest airfreight provider to begin offering its services through online portal cargo.one. The tie-up means that forwarders will now be able to make digital booking of Leisure Cargo's global freight capacity based on live spot rates and receive immediate confirmation. "With the help of cargo.one, Leisure Cargo has thus opened up a new digital and data-driven distribution channel," the company said. Wolfram Simon, managing director of Leisure Cargo, added: "The co-operation with cargo.one will lead to an acceleration and streamlining of booking processes for customers in our time-critical industry. "We are particularly pleased to see that renowned freight forwarders actively requested cargo.one's solution and were happy to use it in previous tests."</p>
      <p>Cargo.one develops proprietary interfaces with partner airlines to provide those dynamic live spot rates to airfreight forwarders. Leisure Cargo markets cargo capacity on 14 low-cost and tourist airlines. Two weeks ago, Lufthansa Cargo also announced it would begin offering capacity on the cargo.one platform.

      <p>Vienna Airport is to spend €16 million ($16.7 million) expanding its Air Cargo Center by one third, and will have one of Austria's largest photovoltaic facilities on its roof to provide electricity.</p>
      <p>Space at the Air Cargo Center will increase by a third adding 15,000 m2 and should be operational by the end of 2017.</p>
      <p>Vienna Airport's operating company, Flughafen Wien says the roof of the Air Cargo Center offers the possibility for one of the largest rooftop photovoltaic electricity generating facilities, doubling the existing 5,000 m2 already installed.</p>

      <p> LAN Cargo has become the first cargo airline operating at Miami International Airport to obtain ISO 14001:2004 certification for its Environmental Management System. The system consists of a series of processes and practices that allow the airline to identify, control, manage and reduce the environmental impact of all its ground operations, including the recently-inaugurated maintenance hangar. LAN Cargo chief executive Cristián Ureta said: "Compliance with these standards will allow us to grow and develop our ground operation more efficiently, improve resource management and allocation, and reduce our operation's environmental impact and carbon footprint." The airline said the certification was the result of three years of work. "Based on a series of tools and actions that strengthen the company's measures to control and reduce environmental impact, the standards also promote the continuous improvement of operations," it said. Among environmental certifications available for the air cargo industry, are IATA's Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) – a voluntary system designed specifically by and for the air industry to improve the environmental management of air operations -, and the ISO 14001:2004 standards, which aim to improve management of ground operations and are applicable to all types of companies. </p>

      <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has launched the IATA Cargo Handling Manual (ICHM) to help airlines and cargo handlers work together more effectively while improving safety and efficiency.</p>
      <p>The ICHM, launched at the IATA World Cargo Symposium in Abu Dhabi, is the first complete set of standards covering operational activities of all stakeholders in the cargo handling supply chain.</p>
      <p>It was developed in consultation with air carriers and cargo handlers based on industry best-practices, the Cargo-iQ Master Operating Plan and international regulations and standards.</p>
      <p>IATA global head of cargo, Glyn Hughes says: "Cargo operations are performed at thousands of airports, by hundreds of handlers. With that number of parties involved, ensuring that global standards and best practices are being observed at all times is a constant challenge."</p>
      <p>"The ICHM is a single reference source that will help promote global consistency and harmonisation of cargo handling procedures, thereby facilitating the movement of goods safely, securely and efficiently while contributing to a reduction in air freight logistic costs."</p>

      <p>Cool Chain Association members last week conducted the first pilot of a new project aimed at improving the supply chain and tackling food loss.</p>
      <p>The members shared temperature data from perishable consignment of five pallets of berries and avocados, moving from Guadalajara, in Mexico, to Kuwait.</p>
      <p>The pallets were monitored during their journey using loggers powered by secure Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Temperature movements, including excursions, revealed by the pilot data will be analysed by Philippe Schuler, food waste campaigner with Too Good To Go, a free smartphone app which enables users to buy leftover food at the end of the day from retailers.</p>
      <p>Partners for the pilot included Cargolux, Able Freight, AirFrance KLM, SmartCAE and Xtreme Technologies.</p>
      <p>Three NFC loggers were placed in an aircraft lower deck pallet during last week's pilot scheme to measure the temperature at the top, bottom, and in the middle of each consignment.</p>
      <p>"This has never been done before, said Edwin Kalischnig, outgoing Secretary General of the CCA and CEO of Xtreme Technologies, which provided the NFC loggers used in the pilot, working with Avery Dennison.</p>
      <p>He presented preliminary findings with Edwin Kalischnig at the CCA's Perishables Conference at Fresh Park Venlo, The Netherlands.</p>
      <p>"Forty percent of the food transported around the world [air, ocean, land] needs refrigeration and 20 percent of food loss is caused by a breakdown in the cool chain," said Schuler.</p>
      <p>Schuler points out that accountability is a problem. He said: "If you have the common objective of reducing food waste, you can achieve it, but we are not transparent across the cool chain and accountability is a problem."</p>
      <p>The CCA project is a starting point, and as we get more data, we will be able to be more scientific and look to develop best practices and solutions."</p>
      <p>Schuler and Kalischnig suggested data collected during the program could be analysed in the context of a metric called Degree-Hours, which takes temperature and time into consideration to give an absolute figure against which consignments on a given journey can be measured.</p>
      <p>"This opens up a new way of working, where we are not pinpointing the excursion, but looking at the journey as a whole and developing solutions," said Eric Mauroux, director Verticals &amp; Global head of Perishable at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo, and CCA Treasurer.</p>
      <p>"When we talk about data sharing, often people approach it from the angle of transparency.</p>
      <p>"In fact, it is also having an understanding that data creates value and it is up to each part of the cool chain to understand the value it brings to them.</p>
      <p>"That could mean developing an adapted offer, or complying, or introducing traceability or increasing shelf life, for example."</p>
      <p>Andrea Gruber, head-Special Cargo, International Air Transport Association (IATA) spoke to delegates about IATA's new industry certification—the Center for Excellence for Perishable Logistics (CEIV Fresh) during the two-day event, which brought together members from across the cool supply chain to network and share best practice.</p>
      <p>She said IATA was looking forward to continuing to get feedback, share ideas and work with the CCA as it develops CEIV Fresh.</p>

      <p>Less than five years ago, the idea of a "cargo community" at an airport was little more than an attempt by the various cargo executives to know everyone's names up and down the supply chain. What each member of the supply chain did, however, was largely a mystery.</p>
      <p>Today, all that has changed as more formalized communities are forming across the globe. Much of this cooperation was prompted by the need to increase quality control procedures for high-value cargo, such as pharmaceuticals. As more forwarders, carriers and ground handlers became certified in Good Distribution Practices (GDP) and IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CEIV-Pharma), the various supply chain stakeholders began to formalize relationships with each other and schedule regular meetings to discuss improving efficiency.</p>
      <p>The following five examples of airport cooperation helped pave the way to today's cargo community trend, which has spread from Asia to Europe and is gaining momentum in North America.</p>

    <title>Emirates SkyCargo gets Cargo iQ certification</title>

      <p>In a latest development, Emirates SkyCargo, the freight division of Emirates, received its first certification from Cargo iQ, at the World Cargo Symposium held in Dallas, USA.</p>
      <p>SGS, Cargo iQ's nominated external audit company, audited Emirates SkyCargo's internal processes, based on measures taken by the carrier to minimise or eliminate shipment errors, to offer more visibility to its customers on the status of their shipments.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo became a member of Cargo iQ in 2016 to further reinforce its service standards, which included its 'Delivered as Promised' commitment. Barely in two years, Emirates SkyCargo integrated the Cargo iQ shipment cycle management standards as the basis for its live shipment planning and cargo tracking.</p>
      <p>"With every Cargo iQ member getting accredited, we are another step towards a supply chain that is transparent and in control of its shipments," said Ariaen Zimmerman, executive director, Cargo iQ.</p>
      <p>"The way Emirates SkyCargo has integrated the Cargo iQ master operating plan with its internal procedures, which clearly shows how the implementation of our standards offer much more than a mere monthly report, and can actually lead to better process and shipment control," said Zimmerman.</p>
      <p>Emirates SkyCargo has invested in setting up a dedicated Cargo Operations Control Centre (COCC), which monitors the status of shipments in real time.</p>
      <p>The COCC uses live shipment data, and Cargo iQ metrics to track the progress of the shipment's journey against its routemap, and the delivery commitment created at the time of booking.</p>
      <p>Alerts are automatically generated when there is a deviation in milestones along the routemap, thereby allowing the COCC to intervene proactively in real time, and take corrective measures at any point from origin to destination.</p>
      <p>The COCC, which operates round-the-clock, constantly monitor shipments across Emirates SkyCargo's global network of over 155 destinations.</p>
      <p>"In the last two years, we have worked on integrating the vision of Cargo iQ into our processes and our 'Delivered as Promised' commitment to our customers," said Nabil Sultan, divisional senior vice president, cargo, Emirates SkyCargo.</p>
      <p>"Getting the Cargo iQ certification and the commencement of our 24/7 Cargo Operations Control Centre is the first step in a journey where we can be more transparent, and at the same time proactively support our customer promises."</p>
      <p>The Cargo iQ Routemap is integrated into the framework of the COCC, which ensures that the service promise and journey updates are exchanged between Emirates SkyCargo and the customer, thereby improving transparency and allows customers to effectively plan their logistics value chain.</p>
      <p>Unique to the air cargo industry, Cargo iQ brings over 80 stakeholders from all aspects of the air cargo supply chain, including airlines, forwarders, ground handling agents, technology providers, and airports to collaborate on developing and implementing service standards in the air cargo industry.</p>
