      <p>Ethiopian Airlines is improving the quality of its climate-controlled services through the use of DoKaSch Temperature Solutions' Opticooler container.</p>
      <p>The Opticooler is equipped with battery powered cooling compressors and heaters as well as a self regulating temperature control, so that temperature sensitive goods, in particular pharmaceuticals such as insulin and vaccines, stay within range at any point in the storage area.</p>
      <p>The airline has also signed a master agreement with the German ULD provider and has also opened the largest cargo terminal in Africa at its hub in Addis Ababa.</p>
      <p>The Addis Ababa hub focuses on handling temperature sensitive goods, and since February, Ethiopian Airlines has offered the DoKaSch active container to fly goods through the hub.</p>
      <p>Ethiopian Cargo &amp; Logistics Services managing director, Fitsum Abady says: "We are very glad to offer our customers a highly reliable packaging solution to transport temperature-sensitive shipments with DoKaSch's Opticooler.</p>
      <p>"In this fast growing and strongly competitive market, it is important that we offer our customers the best packaging solution for their sensitive cargo."</p>
      <p>DoKaSch Temperature Solutions managing director, Andreas Seitz says: "Ethiopian Airlines is the most successful African carrier and their hub in Addis Ababa develops very positive regarding the cargo handlings. Therefore, we are very pleased, that we could expand our African network by signing the master agreement with Ethiopian Airlines."</p>

      <p>Brussels Airlines Cargo has switched its GSSA from European Cargo Services (ECS) to Air Logistics Group for belly-hold space on its passenger services. The carrier said the decision to break with its representative of 13 years was part of "an ambitious strategic plan to further grow its cargo business." It said it marked "a new era in which Brussels Airlines wishes to get even closer to the customer" in its freight activities. Cargo has become an increasingly important activity for the Belgian carrier, with over 41,000 tonnes transported on its routes, which major on Africa but also include the US and the rest of Europe. Freight volumes have grown by double digits over the last five â€“ and by 34% on North Atlantic routes and 8% in revenue terms on African routes. Brussels Airlines vice president sales Africa and cargo, Philippe Saeys-Desmedt explained: "Brussels Airlines Cargo is more than ever a strategic revenue contributor of our business and we foresee a further growth of our tonnage by 6 percent in 2016." ALG will represent Brussels Airlines Cargo worldwide from September 1 except for Africa, where the carrier will continue to represent itself. The carrier already offers a 'Fresh-to-shelf' service for perishable goods from Africa and to launch new products to serve other market segments in the next few months. Saeys-Desmedt added: "This cooperation will allow us to continue to raise Brussels Airlines Cargo's unique cargo brand to our customers, thanks to a dedicated sales team in Brussels and a vast worldwide network of agencies." ALG's chief operating officer Stephen Dawkins said: "Together we are very complementary, as we have extensive experience in the Asian and US markets, while Brussels Airlines is the Africa expert, with their unique and comprehensive network of destinations on the continent. "We will work together very closely to meet their customer's high expectations, so as Brussels Airlines Cargo can build an even stronger market position."</p>

      <p>Qatar Airways Group chief executive Akbar Al Baker hinted that his airline could place orders for further 747-8 freighter aircraft from Boeing, at a handover for the first of the aircraft at the plane-maker's Seattle base on 25 September. He told a press conference that the carrier had "already sold" the capacity on the first two planes. A second 747-F is due to join the Qatar fleet in November. He told the press conference that Qatar Airways was currently experiencing a cargo boom following the blockade imposed by neighbouring countries over the country's alleged support for Middle East terrorist groups. Tonnage was currently up 160% compared with the same time last year, said Al Bakar. He was also confident that the carrier would continue to find a use for additional freighter capacity at such time as the blockade ended, for example by serving additional markets or moving cargo from bellyhold to freighter aircraft. At the conference, he also confirmed an order for an additional four 777-300 passenger aircraft, bringing the carrier's total order book with Boeing to $2.2bn.</p>

      <p>Ethiopian Airlines has ordered an additional 10 Airbus A350-900s to enable further development of its long-haul network.</p>
      <p>The airline took delivery of its first A350 in June 2016, making it the first African operator of this aircraft, and Ethiopian now has four A350s, two of which are on lease.</p>
      <p>Ethiopian Airlines Group chief executive officer, Tewolde GebreMariam says: "The performance, operational and cost efficiencies we have achieved with our initial A350-900s have resulted in these additional ten aircraft order placement and thereby suffice our ever-expanding global network."</p>
      <p>"We will deploy the additional aircraft on our long haul routes connecting Addis Ababa with destinations in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia."</p>
      <p>Airbus Commercial Aircraft chief operating officer customers, John Leahy adds: "Ethiopian Airlines' repeat order is a resounding endorsement of the A350, its suitability, flexibility and unmatched economics. We are delighted that innovative aircraft as the A350 are closely associated with the world's fastest growing and profitable carriers."</p>
      <p>The A350 features the latest aerodynamic design and materials including carbon-fibre fuselage and wings, and is powered by fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, all of which improves efficiency with a 25 per cent reduction in fuel burn and emissions in addition to lower maintenance costs.</p>

      <p>After less than one month on the market, ACL Airshop's real-time Bluetooth-enabled ULD tracking technology is already translating into more cargo business, as carriers take steps to eliminate so-called "black spots" from the airfreight supply chain.</p>
      <p>"Improved ULD logistics has become one of our strategic focuses, as it directly contributes to the bottom line, while substantiating the growth of the top line," said Emile Khasanshin, vice president of global operations for Silk Way West Airlines, which confirmed a multi-year ULD management agreement with ACL Airshop.</p>
      <p>Khasanshin also said that ACL Airshop's technology fit into the carrier's "substantial expansion plans," adding that the new Bluetooth technology "will be a game-changer for us both, and for our end-customers."</p>
      <p>The Silk Way deal builds on ACL Airshop's announcement last month of a strategic alliance with CORE Transport Technologies, and the introduction of real-time Bluetooth tracking on its ULDs. ACL Airshop is now installing CORES's low-energy Bluetooth devices into the company's ULDs, which report ULD locations within airports and around the globe.</p>
      <p>Air freight nets at ACL Airshop's South Carolina facility</p>
      <p>After decades of being relegated to the fringes of air freight, ULDs are now being recognized as an important unit for tracking and measurement, ACL said, prompting renewed interest in technology that can track individual units and compile that into system level data on efficiency and movement.</p>
      <p>This alliance extends 10 years of ACL Airshop's service partnership with other airline units of Silk Way Holding.</p>

    <title>Finnair aims at doubling cargo</title>

      <p>Finnair Cargo is aiming to double the amount of cargo it handles by 2020, as part of its investment in its widebody fleet and construction of a new freight terminal.</p>
      <p>The carrier is set to receive 19 Airbus A350 over the next five years, increasing total bellyhold capacity by 50 per cent. In 2014, the airline handled 149,000 tonnes of cargo and is aiming to process 300,000 tonnes by 2020. Cargo made up 17 per cent of Finnair's revenues last year.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Air Cargo Week (ACW) on Tuesday 30 June before the cornerstone ceremony of the new terminal, Finnair Cargo vice president and head of cargo, Antti Kuusenmaki, says the facility heralds a new era for cargo and is part of a bigger plan and investment by Finnair, totalling three billion euros.</p>
      <p>Kuusenmaki explains Finnair's cargo strategy: "The construction is based on our model of transit cargo and specialised cargo. We have a strategy focusing on life sciences (pharma), perishables, mainly seafood and general cargo." Finnair has introduced eight services for specialist types of cargo including pharma and seafood and will have two more by the end of 2015, Kuusenmaki adds, as part of its bellyhold cargo strategy.</p>
      <p>The key trading lines for Finnair are central Europe and Asia, according to Kuusenmaki, and he says the airline is focusing on driving growth in these regions. The carrier is also set to add more bellyhold routes into high demand regions. "We are strong into North East Asia, China and Japan, as we have the optimum flying time from Europe of nine hours, so we want to get the most from this region," Kuusenmaki tells ACW.</p>
      <p>Kuusenmaki says a high growth area is salmon to Asia, and the carrier's proximity to Norway means they can move salmon to Japan within 36 hours. Finnair is also seeing demand for high-end products to China. The Scandinavian market has not been too well, Kuusenmaki says, and he adds that Helsinki is not the strongest market and has challenges along with nearby Sweden. He says the uncertain macro economic situations in the Eurozone and Russia have not had too much of a negative effect, as strengthening currencies in Asia have helped balance any impact out.</p>
      <p>Another key part of Finnair's strategy, Kuusenmaki explains, is the twice-weekly freighter service into Brussels Airport, its only freighter route. He says this is integral to growth as it feeds the carrier's network in Europe.</p>

      <p>Who'd have thought a product called "Amazing Liquid Fire" could be dangerous air cargo? Apparently, not Amazon.</p>
      <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) didn't think carrying the product, sold as a drain cleaner, was such a hot idea and is looking to slap Amazon with a US$350,000 fine for allegedly shipping prohibited and dangerous goods by air. The proposed fine stems from a 2014 spill of the caustic product, which sent nine UPS employees to the chemical wash after they felt a burning sensation.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time that shippers have been burned for moving prohibited cargo. In 2015, the FAA levied more than $4.5 million in penalties for improper shipments of hazardous air cargo, an increase from $3.4 million in 2014, according to the Dallas Morning News.</p>
      <p>Amazon is feeling the heat, and working with the FAA on the issue, the Seattle-based online retailer said in an e-mailed statement. "We ship tens of millions of products every day and have developed sophisticated technologies to detect potential shipping hazards and use any defects as an opportunity for continuous improvement," the company said. And with an estimated 3.3 million packages a day, 24 documented violations per year jives with the company's defense.</p>

      <p>Pelican BioThermal, the global name in temperature controlled packaging, has been recognised as Supply Chain Innovator at the 2018 "Made in Minnesota Manufacturing Awards" by Minnesota Business magazine.</p>
      <p>The award recognises "leaders and the innovation and ingenuity of the state's manufacturing businesses," says the magazine. Award nominees were evaluated by a nine-judge panel of local manufacturing leaders.</p>
      <p>"Minnesota has been a hub of biopharma development for decades, and we have worked hard to match the pace of innovation," says Pelican BioThermal president David Williams. "We are grateful to be recognised for the hard work our team has performed to drive innovation in the transportation of the latest generation of medical treatments and blood products. At nearly 80 drop-points and network stations across the world, our CrÄ“do on demand program is the culmination of years of hard work by our Minnesota engineers and logistics professionals."</p>
      <p>Pelican BioThermal provides the life sciences industry with the most comprehensive suite of patented and award-winning thermal protection packaging solutions for the safe transport of pharmaceuticals, clinical trials, diagnostics, tissue, vaccines and blood supplies. This award comes on the heels of its European office, Peli BioThermal, receiving its second successive Queen's Award for Enterprise, the United Kingdom's most distinguished business award. Additionally, Pelican BioThermal has announced new network locations in Indianapolis, Indiana, Frankfurt, Germany and Sao Paulo, Brazil as well as key hires to further grow its international footprint.</p>

      <p>Qantas is no longer accepting shipments of lithium ion batteries on its freighters or passenger planes due to concerns of fire or explosion. The ban applies to batteries packed on their own rather than those packed in equipment. The carrier will make an exception if a shipment of the batteries is needed for an emergency. United Airlines and Delta Airlines have already banned the batteries as cargo.</p>

      <p>UPSÂ will strengthen its presence in healthcare logistics with the purchase ofÂ Marken, a global supply chain specialist serving the pharmaceutical and life science industries. The US-based parcels and logistics giant has entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Marken, subject to regulatory approval, which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of UPS. Financial terms were not disclosed. Teresa Finley, UPS chief marketing and business services officer, said: "Healthcare logistics is a strategic market for UPS. Our acquisition of Marken strengthens our portfolio and demonstrates our commitment to customers. "We plan to offer new solutions to our customers and generate further growth opportunities for UPS." Â  UPS said that clinical trials require the strict regulatory compliance, streamlined logistics services and global reach offered by Marken. The acquisition of Marken follows multiple UPS acquisitions that have expanded the company's healthcare logistics services portfolio. "We are excited to join the UPS organisation," saidÂ Wes Wheeler, Marken's chief executive. "UPS' capabilities, particularly in mature markets, will provide many opportunities for us to enhance our service offerings in clinical trials logistics. "With UPS, we will improve our efficiency, while continuing to provide our clients with the high-touch, personalized services that they have come to expect from us." Wheeler will continue to lead the Marken business. Highlighting the reasons for the acquisition, UPS said that pharmaceutical companies, clinical research organisations and contract manufacturers "rely on Marken for collection and transportation of clinical trial material and investigational medicinal products to 49,000 clinical trial sites". Marken is also involved in the shipment of biological samples from these sites to central laboratories. Said UPS in a statement: "These shipments are time- and temperature-sensitive, and their rapid, on-spec delivery is a key factor in the treatment of patients and the success of the clinical trial." Marken has more than 650 employees with an "asset-light" operating structure and 44 locations worldwide, including 10 depots that are compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). "UPS is focused on the logistics complexity of clinical trials, and the acquisition fits well into our long-term growth plans in the biopharma segment," Finley added. "Marken's significant industry expertise and flexible network, combined with UPS's vast integrated global air and ground networks, will provide the life sciences industry with an attractive portfolio of global logistics options." In July 2016, UPSÂ announced expanded logistics capabilities for clinical trials. The company's network includes temperature-sensitive storage and transportation (from ambient and controlled-room temperature, to frozen and cryogenics), 24-hour monitoring and security. UPS now has more than 100 healthcare-dedicated facilities with 60 GMP-compliant locations strategically positioned within global markets. TheÂ Air Cargo NewsÂ Life Sciences and Pharmaceuticals Air Cargo ConferenceÂ will take place in London this yearÂ at the Hilton London Heathrow Airport at Terminal 4 on November 22 and 23.</p>

      <p>Qatar Airways Cargo has addedÂ Colombo in Sri Lanka and Dublin in Ireland to its extensive Pharma Network â€“ bringing the total itÂ services toÂ 73 destinations.</p>
      <p>Colombo was added to its Pharma Network on 15 May, while Dublin's pharma operation begins on 12 June, when Qatar Airways commences its B787 Dreamliner flights toÂ the same city.</p>
      <p>The carrier says Ireland has become one of the leading global hubs for the pharma industry, with nine of the top ten largest pharma companies operating in the country.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka, while also an importer of pharma and healthcare products, expects future earnings from pharma exports to surpass tea export revenue, following the launch of a pharma manufacturing project at the country's Export Processing Zone last year.</p>
      <p>Qatar Airways' chief officer for cargo, Ulrich Ogiermann says:Â "We are experiencing consistent growth each year in the airfreight of pharmaceuticals and healthcare products globally.</p>
      <p>"The expansion of our pharma network to these destinations gives us the opportunity to support expanding pharma businesses in Sri Lanka, the Republic of Ireland and globally. Customers stand to benefit from a seamless cool chain as well as uncompromised service standards.</p>
      <p>"Qatar Airways Cargo customers in the Republic of Ireland will also greatly benefit in terms of time and cost savings, as they will no longer have to truck their freight from the Republic of Ireland to United Kingdom."</p>
      <p>The addition of Colombo and Dublin to the pharma network will enable Qatar Airways Cargo to offer its specialist pharmaceuticals transport solution, 'QR Pharma' to an expanding global customer base.</p>
