In 2014, the airline handled 149,000 tonnes of cargo and is aiming to process 300,000 tonnes by 2020. Cargo made up 17 per cent of Finnair's revenues last year.|Speaking to Air Cargo Week (ACW) on Tuesday 30 June before the cornerstone ceremony of the new terminal, Finnair Cargo vice president and head of cargo, Antti Kuusenmaki, says the facility heralds a new era for cargo and is part of a bigger plan and investment by Finnair, totalling three billion euros.|Kuusenmaki explains Finnair's cargo strategy: \"The construction is based on our model of transit cargo and specialised cargo. We have a strategy focusing on life sciences (pharma), perishables, mainly seafood and general cargo.\" Finnair has introduced eight services for specialist types of cargo including pharma and seafood and will have two more by the end of 2015, Kuusenmaki adds, as part of its bellyhold cargo strategy.|The key trading lines for Finnair are central Europe and Asia, according to Kuusenmaki, and he says the airline is focusing on driving growth in these regions. The carrier is also set to add more bellyhold routes into high demand regions. \"We are strong into North East Asia, China and Japan, as we have the optimum flying time from Europe of nine hours, so we want to get the most from this region,\" Kuusenmaki tells ACW.|Kuusenmaki says a high growth area is salmon to Asia, and the carrier's proximity to Norway means they can move salmon to Japan within 36 hours. Finnair is also seeing demand for high-end products to China. The Scandinavian market has not been too well, Kuusenmaki says, and he adds that Helsinki is not the strongest market and has challenges along with nearby Sweden. He says the uncertain macro economic situations in the Eurozone and Russia have not had too much of a negative effect, as strengthening currencies in Asia have helped balance any impact out.|Another key part of Finnair's strategy, Kuusenmaki explains, is the twice-weekly freighter service into Brussels Airport, its only freighter route.

{"text": "Canadian shippers set to screen air cargo|Canada is edging closer to a revised air cargo security process that will allow shippers to screen outbound airfreight consignments prior to arrival at an airport. Department officials at Transport Canada estimate that the amendments would result in a net benefit of C$202m over 10\u00a0years. \"Shippers need to be given the authority to screen their own goods,\" said Transport Canada, adding: \"In order to do so, there must be a regulatory framework in place to establish, maintain and enforce a security program that international partners will recognize.\" The fresh proposals by the federal government in Ottawa aim to replace the current registered shipper process with \"a more robust known-consignor program, in order to address security gaps in the secure supply chain,\" said Transport Canada. The country's current Air Cargo Security Program does not allow shippers to screen and secure their own goods intended to go by air. The proposed amendments would allow consignors or originators of the freight to become known-consignors and to screen and tender their own goods as secure cargo, either to members of the existing Air Cargo Security Program or directly to air carriers. Transport Canada says that goods worth C$100bn are processed every year at Canadian airports, with more than 400 tonnes of cargo moved on passenger aircraft. Eighty per cent of all air cargo departing Canadian airports is destined for non\u2013US international destinations.

{"text": "Volume growth at Pactl raises expectations|Over the past decade, Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG) has grown in importance in the air freight universe to the point that it is now the second busiest airport in the world for international cargo, behind only Hong Kong (HKG), and the third busiest for total cargo, lagging only Hong Kong and Memphis (MEM).|Pactl, the biggest cargo handler at PVG, has become something of a bellwether for the state of the air freight industry, in the sense that growth or decline in cargo volume at PVG in general and Pactl in particular usually reflects what is happening to overall air freight demand, whereas HKG is subject to wider swings, and MEM handles almost no freight other the FedEx's express volume.|For those looking for clues about patterns in demand for air freight, PVG also offers the advantage of being one of the first major air cargo players to report monthly results. So, given some of the negative analyses recently published about the lack of year-over-year growth in March being a harbinger of difficult times ahead, it was with more than a little interest that we looked to Pudong International at the end of last week for publication of its April cargo performance.|Of course, one month, for one handler, at one airport, even if that handler/airport combination is Pactl and Shanghai Pudong International, does not absolutely guarantee anything about worldwide cargo trends, but, for what it's worth, Pactl had a very good month, reporting its April handle up 7.2 percent year-over-year to 163,000 tonnes. For the first four months of 2018, Pactl's handle was up 6.3 percent to 600,000 tonnes. International volume was up 7.4 percent in April to 155,000 tonnes, and up 6.8 percent to 569,000 tonnes for the year through April. The much smaller domestic volume was up 3.8 percent in April to 8,000 tonnes. (Most of Shanghai's domestic cargo moves through Hongqiao Airport (SHA)).|Given that Pactl's reported growth is usually one or two percentage points ahead of worldwide growth, it seems reasonable to hope for year-over- year demand growth worldwide in April in the range of 5 percent to 6 percent. Not as spectacular as last year's double-digit percentage growth, but a solid result that will leave air freight players more than happy."}

The most recent annual \"State of Online Logistics Sales 2016 Mystery Shopping Survey,\" conducted by Freightos, found that large forwarders have made surprisingly little progress with their online freight booking platforms. \"I think it's time for this industry to catch up,\" said Freightos CEO, Zvi Schreiber.|However, behind the scenes, Schreiber said that the wakeup call is beginning to be heard, and forwarders are scrambling to catch up with early movers like Kuehne + Nagel and Delta Airlines.|As most airfreight industry insiders are aware, the capabilities and sophistication of back-end IT systems are rapidly advancing, but what about on the front end? Is the customer experience dramatically different? For shippers looking to obtain quotes and book directly online with a forwarder, the answer seems to vary dramatically, according to Israel-based Freightos.|For the \"mystery shopping\" experiment, Freightos interacted with the online booking portals of the world's top 20 global freight forwarding websites (the same ranking that was used in Air Cargo World's Power 25 list), and requested identical quotes for a less-than-container-load (LCL) shipment from a city in China to Chicago. The quote\u00a0request included sufficient information for a forwarder to respond with a quote, including load type, harmonized system (HS) code, weight, dimensions, incoterms and a statement that the shipper would compare the quote with a direct competitor.|Before diving further into the results, it should be noted that Freightos is a company that not only sells online quote-automation software, but also operates its own online freight marketplace, so the results of this exercise are not free from bias. Even so, the results indicate the majority of the world's top forwarders are not equipped to offer fast, automated freight quotes through online portals.|Despite incessant talk about innovation in IT and digitization throughout the forwarding industry, the results from 2016's survey were actually worse than the conclusions from 2015. Schreiber told Air Cargo World, \"the results from this year were abysmal. With the exception of Kuehne + Nagel, there was no improvement. In fact, the average quotation actually took longer.\""}
